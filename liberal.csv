Being a mom is hard. Constant self doubt is common. You just have to do the best you can every day. Love your kid and make sure they know you love them. Part of loving them is not letting them act like little shits. Nothing is guaranteed and this modern world does not help. Good luck.
"Hard to say this without sounding crass, but your little ones odds of dying by gunshot are much higher having a gun in the house. I had to separate false security from real security… the gun wasn’t keeping me safe and only increased the likelihood of me or my kids being hurt or killed. But I felt safe? Not worth it. It’s a weird thing. I got rid of it."
"I feel this way a lot of the time. School shootings and lockdown drills have definitely traumatized me, and I'm just a parent on the periphery.   
The worry and anxiety is hard to ignore. So frustrating because it prohibits me from feeling truly safe or happy and enjoying my kids while I have them.   
One thing you can do is vote for representatives that support common sense gun laws. Do not ever vote for anyone who takes money from the gun lobby. I've taken it a step farther and any business or individual who blindly supports the 2nd amendment no longer gets my money. I take my business elsewhere."
"You know dads care about our kids too, right? I'm so fucking sick of society perpetuating the idea that because I didn't grow my children inside of me that I'm somehow irrelevant in conversations about parenting.

Just say parents.

And yeah it's fucking terrifying. Add on top of it that I'm a teacher so I know just how useless our plans to protect them are."
"Or Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, Idaho or West Virginia."
There's going to be a massive brain drain in the red states. It's the great sorting on steroids.
"How many people, like myself are actively planning on moving out of Florida and similar states.  (We spend part of the weekend doing a spring clean purge and updated LinkedIn and resume this week.   We are gone as soon as we can get jobs/sell house.  Blue state tbd here we come (WA and CO are on short list)"
Well yeah? Why would you want to get a higher education in a state that’s trying to dismantle education lol
Think odds of being gay is like 5-10%?  If I was gay I'm not staying in/or going to florida.
That number is gonna get a lot bigger soon
Just on access to voting no young person should attend college in a Red State. And because of lack of Reproductive Rights in Red State no young lady should attend college in a Red State.
JUST 1 in 8?
floriDUH
Excellent!!!
Well that’s not nearly enough
DeSantis is bad for our state.  The more people become familiar with his fascism the more they will have a negative opinion of Florida.  It will take a long time to undo the damage that DeSantis has done.
"1/8, while we recognize it’s a significant number, doesn’t exactly seem like a slam dunk, pardon the pun."
I'm really disturbed by the flip side- 7 in 8 prospective college students considering Florida.
"Well, can you blame them? Anyone can carry a concealed weapon with no permit. Lots of people don't want to get shot by crazy people with guns."
An excellent argument for getting state and federal funding out of schools.
That will probably mobilize Florida as much as anything. Just kidding. They probably won’t worry till it’s at least 50%.
Add oklahoma to the list
"It's what they want. Less liberals mean they can run their states like fiefdoms, and they get a bigger say in Congress."
there long has been. how do you think they become so poisonously red?
Why?
This is *in* Florida. 7/8 probably *can't* disregard in-state tuition or they plan to attend a private institution where state policies have no bearing.
This is just among high school students in FL.
"Along with the brain drain will be less cash from sports and less recognition from tournaments

what we need is the realignments where the red or the taker states no longer has access to the tax dollars from the blue or federal giving states, and this may just be one of  the keys for it"
"It isn't going to work, though. The cost of housing in the south is already driving a mass exodus to the south. And there is no way they can win when they rely so heavily on an aged population. It will have short term benefits, but long term, conservatism is doomed. It has no value to society, and never has. The problem is, young people all know it."
"What I mean is it's going to accelerate. There's been a brain drain before yes but people declining to even go to colleges or universities in red states, even when it's their home state, is an escalation."
The Texas Legislature is currently debating and eventually voting on similar laws targeting higher ed.
"Because those states are going backwards in time, Boxcar Willie."
You said South twice? The cost of housing in the south is driving a mass exodus to the south?
Thanks. I was just curious on your perspective and which states and such in addition to Florida. I wasn’t disagreeing.
"He means low property prices in the south, low prices attract people who would never be able to afford California-expensive homes"
"Yes, yes, feast on each other."
"Sadly this is where I live.  I used to live in NYC and just surrounded by art, culture and diversity and such intelligent people and then my mom got sick and I made the heartbreaking decision to move closer to her to be able to help her on a daily basis and it crushes my soul to see such bigotry and ignorance in my neighbors."
Oh lookie. A Republiclown-car parade & food fight! Let me get my popcorn! 🤣
"I hate them both, but also if the enemy of my enemy is my friend then I also like them both... but if I like them both then who is my enemy... okay so then I hate them... both... woops there I go liking them for fighting again... okay... so now I really do hate them... fuck I like them again... okay okay lets settle on hate, but I do like them fighting."
This is gonna be good
That's because DeSantis is secretly working with the deep state to remove Trump from running. /s
DeSantis is the worst self-loathing gay man I've ever seen.
"Apparently the loudest heckler was a lawyer who had held a couple of fellowships with the Claremont Institute.  And went to Cornell Law.

It appears they are devolving from humanhood right before our eyes."
Oh well. It looks like the Trump-DeSantis bromance is all over and done. They are both a couple of stupid clowns anyway and that MAGA bunch are a crazy stupid crybaby cult full of drama queens.
"Begun, the Clown Wars have."

Hahahahahaha…. Like a pit of vipers turning on each other.
🤣
"Oh, they were under the illusion THEY will not come for THEM"
DeSantis is like jeb bush with less energy
"If DeSatan dares to run, Trump will see to it that he ""disappears."""
Trump flags. Jesus.
"Not apologizing.  Just pointing out if he actually wanted to burn the world down, he COULD have.  Do you agree with that?  Sure he did a laundry list of shit but burning the world down isn't on the laundry list.  That's all I'm saying."
Oh no ..... Anyhow
Now the GOP has to contend with the monster they built. Donald Trump would burn down the world before relinquishing power.
I LOVE to see it
"(Mr. Burns voice) ""Exxxxx-cellent""."
"A huge reason why I left Indiana, which is just as bad, but quieter about it."
"In WWII Stalin was an ""ally,"" even though he was as bad as Hitler.

Churchill loathed him."
This is why he’ll lose to trump. When you put them on a stage next to each other it’ll be obvious that’s he’s disingenuous. Trump is so comfortable in his disgusting skin that it exposes people.
And it seems he is doing just that.
Didn't he like...relinquish power though?
Who's the biggest piece of shit fascist.
"It's because *he's not Trump.*

If he goes ahead and runs, Trump will see to it that he ""disappears""."
"I live in KY. I had the opportunity to move to a rent controlled apartment in San Fran, but met my husband and now I’m kind of pissed/glad that if enough of us can switch the tide, we might not be in an extreme hellscape."
"Why does everyone keep saying ""X will happen to DeSantis in a debate""  as if the Republicans ever adhere to any set protocol?  If debating or public speaking isn't a strength for DeSantis, he'll simply refuse to do it.  The far right has deviated so far from the norm with Trump that they'll be fine with no debates."
"Trump is essentially desantis’s boss. He will bow to him all the way down, because if he turns on trump he has like .2% of the Republican vote"
"I'm talking about the power he has within the party, the control he has over his percentage of the voters. They worship him. It's possible that the number will get lower. Maybe, maybe not. Some say it could get higher but I don't think so. Even his supporters are going to start to question reality when there is a series of mugshots of their leader."
Ties for everyone.  Really long ones.
"I am 57 years old and have never seen the country this bad.

The Confederacy never went away. It just went dormant. Trump awakened it."
"Ok im just saying your comment didn't make any sense.   He was literally the leader of the free world and literally could have burned the whole world down.   But he literally relinquished that power.    You should be more precise with your language and maybe lay off the hyperbole,  you sound like trump himself."
He is burning down the world to prevent power from being relinquished from him. Something he would never willingly do because he is no team player.
He didn't go quietly.. pay attention..
Ok so how is he burning down the world?  Lol I swear you're like a doomsday cult.
"You're an apologist for a scumbag who thinks nothing of you. Go ahead, send him more money. 

So he relinquished power yes, but not willingly. Do you know about Jan 6? (it was all over the news). It was literally an attempted violent coup to retain power. After he was voted out of office he tried to get the military to seize voting machines and they told him no. He tried to get the military to pull every American serviceman from Korea and Western Europe and was also told no. He tried to appoint a flunky as head of the FBI and was told the entire White House staff would resign. He tried to send VP Pence to Alaska so he wouldn't vote to certify the election. 

It's funny he's been indicted for paying off a porn star and trying to cover up the crooked paperwork. It's the very least of his crimes. The Unhinged Orange One vowed ""retribution"" to all that harmed him and vowed to make his second term one of spite."
Time to go pet your pussy
"There is no bigger pussy than Donald Trump. You see supporters with him shirtless as Rambo, but he is a physical coward who avoided Vietnam because he's rich. 

There has never been a more thin-skinned politician. He gets mad when a celebrity makes fun of him. He tried to get SNL in trouble because they made fun of him."
"They couldn't define ""woke.""  And now they advertise that they don't know what it means."
"You mean the people who started out complaining about vaccines who are now obsessed with drag queens, limiting books in classrooms, what people do in bathrooms and the hypothetical end to girls sports? My opinions haven’t changed much. Vaccines are good; drag queens are proformers so if you don’t want to see the show don’t, it really is that easy; if you want to know what your kids learn in school then you should talk to your children daily and meet their teachers at least twice per year to discuss progress and concerns but books are important to learning and learning about a wide variety of topics and opinions is important, don’t limit the books kids have access to and don’t be a lazy parent (if your only way of teaching kids “good values” is only showing them a very limited view of the world it will backfire and you are being lazy), if you are really concerned with the safety of women and girls in bathrooms maybe a more productive argument rather than genital checks would be bathrooms with better privacy (can we agree those flimsy metal walls and doors with giant gaps kids fit through and slide locks that give you a quarter size hole were never private enough); as for girls sports I feel like we should deal with athletes on a local level and case by case basis instead of trying to pretend there are giant waves of people pretending to transition to play sports at a higher level. I feel like the parents, teachers, coaches and pediatricians the child actually knows would be better positioned to determine the correct sports team for them to try out for."
"Get mad and vote for me. Only I can protect you from this minority. Oh, and by the way I'm making laws that seriously limit people's freedoms. Why, you ask? Because ""Freedom, y'all!"""
Uninformed idiots
"I don't think very much about them.  Other than the fact that the central belief of the anti-woke movement is

""I am not a racist or bigot. I just don't like it when other people are against racism and bigotry."""
"Stupid.

Or grifters.

Or both.

No exceptions."
They are dumb
"Anti-woke is another way of saying ""socially comatose""."

"Oh? Well, whatever. I think TikTak (as Bohbert calls it) is just plain stupid."
Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem
Conspiracy theories are dumb.
Doesn’t add up. Social media that is American-owned is a dumpster fire of wacky fringe stuff.
"Depends on what you watch. My content seems like it’s mostly : education (serious and humor), dogs, home improvement, foster care, and some politics. That’s me!"
What?
"That is at least  halfway a fair point…. 

Twitter for damn sure is but Facebook not so much…"
Yea I’m pretty sure multiple and necessary are there but that’s all I got. 😝
"Is that a joke? Facebook has been disinformation central for extreme right-wing nonsense. They were the first in the headlines about it, well before Twitter. They were essential to Trump’s 2016 campaign."
"It's Occam's Razor. Basically, don't overcomplicate things more than necessary. Do the owners of TikTok need to tweak the algorithm to show different content in different areas? Or is there just more wacky fringe stuff available in the West?"
"But that took foreign intervention lol…. 

So not quite the point you thought you were making I bet."
"It could go either way.. 

What I like about the theory is it is not overly complicated, isn’t going to be considered an act of war or anything, but could be incredibly effective. 

It would require VERY little maintenance or investment, but could very well could pay massive dividends in sowing negative discourse. 

All it would require is a single line of code or 2"

"She's a Trump. When someone is no longer useful, they're discarded."
">Meanwhile, she has been missing her social life in elite, liberal New York City circles...

I have to wonder how popular she was before her father decided he wanted to play at being president. He's always been a garbage person, and so has her father-in-law.

&#x200B;

>An aide told The Daily Beast in November that Ivanka skipped out on her dad's 2024 presidential campaign announcement because she wants out of politics so she can focus on her three kids and husband, Jared Kushner.

Or maybe she's distancing herself from her criminal father so he doesn't throw her under the bus."
She and Kushner got their $2 billion. Trump taught her how to use people.
The entire Trump crime family needs to be prosecuted for their countless crimes against the USA 🇺🇸
"When somebody ... ANYBODY ... puts on the clown makeup & climbs in the tRUmp clowncar to make money & 'enjoy the ride,' the dismount at the curb can be rough! Bless her heart. 😎

Real King Lear vibes
Probably thinks she's presidential material so she's got to be careful
"If he goes down, or fails to deliver, his loyalists will try to run her as the first woman president under the red flag."
I actually kind of like her statement. Honest.
"This artificial, lifeless, monotonous idiot really believes she is going to be the first female President, doesn’t she?"
The only thing Trump taught her was to not break stupid laws and never be alone with a man like her dad.
One of the daughters was named Regan; one could say our national nightmare started with Reagan. Have we been living inside a Shakespearean tragedy all along?
"It's not just that.

Her and Jared really enjoyed their New York City lifestyle. But they turned themselves into pariahs with their involvement in and support of their father's administration. Because there are a lot of Democrats among the wealthy in NYC. 

So my guess is they're probably also trying to keep their distance now from Trump for social reasons, not just political aspirations."
"So here's a question that really makes me think. When I run a race my entry fee goes to an item that I get once I finish a race. That isn't a participation trophy but it is based on my participation and it is given or ""rewarded"" to me. And what about things that aren't about winning: sportsman's-like conduct, most enthusiastic, etc. What about coach awards that aren't based on winning? If this law is passed I see it just as a way for the state to harass races it sponsors and add to the complexity. And what's the problem with celebrating a race if you didn't win.
I really want to hear a conservative argue ""Well Joey just ran a 40 mile marathon that be had to fly 1000 miles for, from Alaska but that's no reason for him to bring anything back because he didn't win."""
Because they have nothing better to do
"The conservative Right used to complain about liberal “social tinkering”, now that’s all that Republicans do anymore—they have zero platform and zero morals as well"
They are a sensitive and easily irritated bunch.
"Im not sure what they are trying to achieve hear. We just took all of the harder working or more talented kids put them on the A team and moved them to a more competitive league. Then split all the others to be even as possible. This works in soccer, basketball, football etc etc."

Ezra Klein
"Knowledge Fight. It is focused on Alex Jones but they lay down some common sense that you’ll be missing in daily wire. 

Even Bill Maher for something towards the center."
It could happen here
Bill Maher is a mysogenistic old white fart whose only 'liberal' credentials is that he is an environmentalist (as long as it doesn't cost him anything).
Seems fair. He is certainly no progressive.
If I had a kid that was college age there is zero chance they go to a Florida public school.   Anyone with a scholarship to a Florida state school should see if they can get a similar one in another state.   Drain Florida of any talent (scholarly and/or athletic).
We need our president.
"For the religious woke should be viewed as WWJD, what would Jesus do.  For the non religious, woke equals empathy.  You have to be a really hateful person to think woke is bad."
">Anyone with a scholarship to a Florida state school should see if they can get a similar one in another state.

Florida has their state-funded Bright Future scholarship for Florida high school students, which covers all or part of tuition for attending a Florida public college or university. 

So lot of those students will have trouble getting equivalent scholarships for out of state. State colleges and universities offer more scholarship to their in-state students than out-of-state students."
"Yes!  When I run into someone who says “woke is bad”. I ask them to define woke, then as…why is that bad?"
"True.  I said they should see if there is an option. Obviously if that is the ONLY way then by all means get that education however you can but if you are a top tier student or student athlete, then take those skills elsewhere as you have much better options that Florida at this point."
The bullet point for today's GOP House members is to distract from the fact that the party appointed a crook who used fraud to take an election.
Republicans are a joke. Hey lets make us false narratives and use lies and misinformation and then accuse Democrats of doing the same thing to justify it...good thing the media has our backs to push bothsideism.
"> The committee called Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.) and Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry (R), a former congressman, to testify against the Biden administration at the hearing.

> But after their testimony, in which Schmitt and Landry both accused the administration and the federal government as a whole of attempting to strong-arm social media platforms and alleging a scheme that tipped the scales in the favor of then-candidate Biden in 2020, Jordan allowed both witnesses to leave the hearing without taking questions from Democrats. It was a move that incensed Democrats on the panel.

> “These witnesses are being dismissed without the ability to cross examine their statements, they’ve made some outlandish allegations here,” Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) said to Jordan. “Consistent with the work of, especially this select committee, and congressional hearings in general, we should have the ability to question their statements.”

Standard rightwing tomfoolery.  It’s a kangaroo court where witnesses lie on the stand and are allowed to leave without cross examination.  The head of the committee then instigates a fight with those who have an expectation of fairness or justice."
Republicans are long on adjectives and short on specifics  or coherent arguments
"Lol oh so only republicans can question?

Looks like Gym finally learned democrats run circles around them and their lies."
How’s this hearing with helping inflation? Republicans literally just want 5 sec sound bites for Faux News.
I am hoping this makes anyone else thinking of charging him just to go for it. Let the floodgates open. It’s OK.
Lolololol although I'll be more excited if/when he is actually convicted of something.
"Oh, Donny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling."
Lock him up! Lock him up!
Woo hoo!!!!!!!!!
Hopefully first of many many indictments to come.

I just feel like no matter what he's going to get off.  He will be made to pay some amount of money and he can go on trying to ruin the country.
I’m pretty sure you mean to say that Donald Trump has been “indicated.”

It's the grand jury we are waiting on.
it already is. Social Media is a mess tonight.
"With Jan 6, the feds just got judges to require Pence, etc., to testify before the grand jury. 

So I'm pretty sure it'll be months before we see indictments in that case."
Social media is just a mess period
In some ways slow walking that isn’t the worst thing. Having him on trial during the middle of 2024 campaign season isn’t going to supercharge his campaign the way some people seem to think it will. The Fox news crowd will no longer be able to avoid all of the bad things coming out and if there’s one thing the GOP detests it’s weakness. I’ve seen even hardcore Trumpers on FB start to post links about “moving on” from Trump so I think his support will crumble pretty quickly when the dominos start to fall.
">In some ways slow walking that isn’t the worst thing. 

I don't think they will be slow walking it.

Rather, they need to get these testimonies on record. Then they'll use whatever they collect from that to put some pressure on a couple of his minions to flip. Then they'll get them to testify again. Then they'll put more pressure on some of the minions. It is a recursive cycle.

That takes time to negotiate immunity deals, plea deals, or issue indictments with these underlings before they have all the evidence they need to get to Trump."
"Yes I agree - I was being a little tongue in cheek with that comment that may not have been obvious. I guess my point was that I disagree with the conventional wisdom that this will somehow be good for Trump. My sincere hope is that now that the initial indictment has been issued, it will make it easier for subsequent indictments and we might actually see some accountability."
"I say fly the flag! The neighbors might not understand the symbolism, but you’ll know what it’s for. A lot of liberals I hang out with think it’s important for us to reclaim the symbols of patriotism. This is our country too, and there’s a lot to be proud of."
"You mean an American flag? If so, fly it proud!"
"Unfortunately, even though I am a veteran, I am very skittish about flying the flag.

The far right have co-opted it so badly that I do not want to be connected with them.

I stopped flying it the moment Trump was elected. I was boiling angry at a country *stupid* enough to elect him!

And that's a very bad thing. And that's on me. 100%.

I'm an amateur vexillologist.

I fly the Grand Union Flag, the first flag of the United States (albeit unofficial)."
I really do not believe trump supporters are aware enough to know why you are displaying it.  They are not exactly deep independent thinkers that are capable of connecting your flag display to Cheetos arrest.
It belongs to all of us.
Put up your flag; you know what you mean by it. My own reaction yesterday was to set off several bottle rockets. :-)
"If American flag, fly"
"I believe flags are currently at half-mast through sunset today (3/31) in honor of the victims of the Nashville school shooting, just FYI. https://halfstaff.org"

"My advice: Think for yourself.  Do what you want.  Fly the U.S. flag for any reason you'd like.

That'll definitely show em'."
Do what you want. Freedom of speech
Just have the flag out everyday and the mental gymnastics are avoided.
We fly ours 24/7. No way are they taking that from us
"The flag is the symbol that started me on my journey to liberalism. Because the flag literally stands for liberal government.

It's definitely ours. Fly it."
This \^
"Almost feels like if you want to fly the flag today, you need a sign that explains your feelings and disavows certain things."
Lolomg
"Oh god, thank you."
"Good point.

Even today, rank-and-file Germans are skittish about flying their black-red-gold flag.

They know where nationalism has got them in the past."
Because they're fucking delusional.
Because it's not actually the party of Law and Order (TM).  It's a cult.
What ARE they going to say?
They see it as an attack on the R party and expect all R's to rally round his election.
It is magical thinking.  It is the only thing that the Republicans are good at.
Trump supporters rarely say anything rational or logical. Their streak continues.
If there’s one thing Republicans love it’s criminals.
"Trump literally paid hush money to a porn star during a presidential campaign. Even if he wasn't indicted no sane moralistic human being would vote for someone who did this in the first place.  
  
Republicans have less than no moral ground to stand on defending him. Further, his family organization was found guilty of tax fraud, yet another reason never to vote for the guy.  
  
Republicans should be happy others are doing the dirty work of cleaning up a corrupt human being from their party that has no morals or or a spine to stand up for justice and do what's right themselves. 

Republicans are pathetic and an embarrassment to America."
This is the first of many indictments.  Trumpski's got a rap sheet as long as your arm.  He will be swimming in indictments before this baby is done.  He's history.
"Didn’t even know he had any official challenger except Nikki Hale. DeSantis and Pence haven’t officially declared but I bet that changes when the charges come out and then hopefully GA and DOJ follow suit. 

Right now this all reactionary and “noise” from the right.  I bet some of these talking heads pivot real fast when the dominoes start falling."
Because it increases his popularity among conservatives as they view this as a witch hunt. Pretty simple actually
Pretty much because they write their own rules and create their own math. Just a bunch of uneducated white men convincing the people around them to abandon their own best interests to prop up the white man. Works every time.
"...because admitting that Trump's first election resulted from a massive fraud perpetuated on the nation's voters makes the entire party look like they are only in it for the power and control of the Treasury.    


They are but they don't want to look like it, too."
"They'll happily elect a wanna-be dictator, twice impeached, con artist who wouldn't give them a rusty penny just to OwN tHe LiBs!!!!  

Crusty incel cum socks have more brain genetics than MAGA voters."
They’re huffing copium by the cylinder
"Because that's their playbook. They break the law and flout the rules, and when anybody calls them on it, they demonize the left (usually by using dog whistles suggesting that rich Jews or African Americans are behind the prosecutions)."
They use mental gymnastics and gaslighting as a motivational tactic
They have nothing left and have gone this far in the cult so they are using manipulative rhetoric
"Because they all have a persecution complex, and believe this makes him more popular. If they cared about winning, they would find someone independents would vote for."
"If you see this (or want to see this) as a politically motivated attack, it becomes a galvanizing moment - your supporters are going to work harder to fight back against a corrupt, politically motivated DA and his persecution of your movement, while you can try to spin the ""Democrats use political power to silence opposition"" line to win over independents.  It's the same reason why they set up a house committee to investigate ""weaponization of big government,"" the line is that Republicans are a part of freedom, while Democrats are a party of corruption and abuse of power.  

And to be fair, there's a bit of a point there - there aren't too many people who were Trump supporters earlier this week who are just now thinking ""ooh, maybe this guy isn't too savory.""  The amount of support lost because of this is going to be much less than the fact that there's now a rallying point.  Even Desantis is supporting Trump on this by saying he won't go along with attempts to arrest him in Florida."
Because they think being a criminal and a disgusting human being are actually traits to strive for and considered leadership quality.
"I believe we don't know the full ramifications yet. Not many people rioting maybe too early.  The weekend is coming.  One thing I can say is NYC is the perfect place for the first indictment. Most go through a tunnel or go over a bridge to get on or off the Island. And NYC Police won't take that crap like the Capital Police did.

IT'S TIME TO GET ON WITH IT.

But better now while we hold the White House.  Can you imagine trying to stop this scourge with no political power or control of the military?
People in this country need to wake up and work to guarantee the democracy in this country.
From tRamp to Desatan's anti-woke dictatorship in Fl.  
(Speaking of Tiny D it's funny he believes he and his law school buddy can intimidate Micky.  Mikey has been around for generations and isn't going anywhere.  He needs to remember he's a freeloader in a political office that is so temporary.  Mikey is forever.) 🤣🤣🤣

I believe in 2 yrs when this circus of a congress is cleaned out, tRamp is in the least under house arrest and Biden feels comfortable enough to retire and turn our country over to a  younger ctizens we will have successfully averted a slow growing coup in this country.  IF NOT?  I'm 70 and was so blessed to have grownup in the best of times in the best country in the world., the USA. 
I won't know the difference but while I'm alive I will work for my grandchildren and their future.

Their worldview depends upon them always being victimized by (fill in the blank). They’re especially not going to pass up this victim train.
Bc they're all fascists.
"Probably because the charges are a joke… this is not going to look for our side and will only make us look terrible… 

As big of a POS as he was they couldn’t find something legitimately crappy to charge him with?? 


See when you over reach you make someone a martyr and discredit your side when it comes to all future and past allegations."
Who exactly are we talking about?
They think indictment  will make him into a wildly popular martyr...
Don’t forget- hate and crazy votes. That’s why the MAGAts will turn out in the primaries and give him the nomination.
Because if there's one thing modern Republicans love it's getting to play victim.
"Every single time that something comes out about trump, they say it will cement his chances of winning the election in 2020, his indorsements will win in 2022.. 

And every time they get proven wrong. 

But in this case, I thought it was already a given that he'd get the nomination."
Because being a criminal is a prerequisite. The more charges the better.
"The primary, yes, since the other Rethuglican candidates are defending him."
They want to take the shine off the liberal’s apple.
The other side in a nutshell.
That's putting it mildly!
Exactly ! They think he’s Jesus Christ too
"Yeah, they really have nothing now. ""Trump not actually bad, because we say so."" That's it, that's all they can come up with. It's just like backing a stupid person into a corner during an argument because you have the facts to support your argument. They lash out & say things that don't make any sense."
"Rich, white one’s at least."
"Didn’t a lot of people vote for a guy who authorized a drone strike on a civilian cafe? How would you categorize those people if the people who voted for a guy who paid hush money to a pornstar are neither sane, nor moral?"
"Paula Jones.

And I didn't give a fuck Clinton paid her off."
"I thought someone else paid the money? That it wasn’t actually Trump, but his lawyer. I was reading that because of that, it exonerated him. Is that not true?"
"Ron Tiny D is very happy.  He even got the opportunity to win over the MAGAts by announcing he wouldn't let NY extradite him. Perfect for him.  He could keep tRamp inside Mag-Gat-Lardo for ever, making another tourist attraction for FL.

Time to #GET ON WITH IT"
Tbh and I say this as someone who hates Trump I think paying Stormi Daniels is the least bad thing he did and these charges look quite stupid. But the tax fraud and stealing sensitive information is what he should have gotten done for
"Desantis can't declare without stepping down as governor, although he filed a bill to remove that part of Florida law yesterday."
"They know it's not a witch hunt but they like to lie.  Just like FOX ""News""  All about money and power.  Not for everyone that votes for them, but just for the few rats that will bite, kick and scratch to get to the top.  You can already see Marge and Boobert biting and scratching like two whores over a john.  And the john thinks he won. 🤣🤣🤣"
"Just thinking...maybe we should be nicer to them....nah, sorry I'm a little high."
🙄🤣🤣🤣🤣
"Did you fall for that DeSatan shit?  He's happy as pig in mud.  He spoke out to try to get the MAGAt base once tRamp can't use it. 
BTW everything you just said about Democrats is total projection. 
Your reasoning is askewed."
That’s the Liberian flag.
The charges are not public so you're just making up what they are to fit your narrative in your head.
What would have been the better solution? Just letting him get away with his crimes?
"Really? He literally paid hush money to a porn star during a presidential campaign. Even if he wasn't indicted no sane moralistic human being would vote for someone who did this in the first place.

You have less than no moral ground to stand on. Further, his family organization was found guilty of tax fraud, yet another reason never to vote for the guy. Your comment is literally a joke.

You should be happy others are doing the dirty work of cleaning up a corrupt human being from a Republican party that has no morals or or a spine to stand up for justice and do what's right themselves. Republicans are pathetic and an embarrassment to America."
"You were almost certainly not on the grand jury, so honestly it’s time to STFU and wait."
Wait!
Like the ratfinks Marge & Boobert?
Don’t try to fix the joke.
"No, no one did that. Any other dumb thoughts?"
"What's your point comrade?  Who are you trying to blame? Obama, Biden?? 
You don't remember who sent our troops into Iraq to settle a score for his old man?  WMD my ass.  We terrorised an entire country and will pay for it for generations.

So really, what's your point?  I have the time."
That wasn't during his campaign.
That payment was from a lawsuit.  Not the same.
"Who the fuck cares about Paula Jones?  What decade arre you living in?  Why is that even relevant??  I don't care how many women ( or men)  the tRamp humped (willing or not).

Right now we need to rid this rot from our government or we'll be speaking russian and working for the Chinese."
"No, that’s not true at all.  If that were the case all crimes could just be committed with a surrogate."
I can’t see any of your replies. Not sure why
Good lord.  All eyes should be on FL and the people of FL need to get out and protest against this bill.  I wouldn't be surprised if he declared himself king and still ran for president.  This man is Hitler incarnated.
You seem unwell
"I didn't say any of that was true, it's just the narrative spin that republicans can put on it, of course it's skewed. But skewed voters still vote, so this is the challenge democrats are up against, trying to counter the ""crooked dems are doing a political hit job"" narrative. Obviously if he's found guilty, it'll make running for office a lot trickier, but if he skates on the charges, it's going to lend a lot of credence to ""elected democrat DA tried to get him, jury of Americans proved that it was all a lie."""
"That is what is being reported , and not on Fox News… so obviously I am not just making it up in my head..

Your doing wishful thinking, but I hope you are right."
"How about prosecuting him for the Georgia stuff or he has to have evaded taxes… 

There is no way this obviously reaching BS is all they can find on him."
"A) the charges are that he did not report the payoff too the election board, not that he paid her off.. 

The American people did not care about the Monica Lewinsky stuff in the 90s and the republicans paid a big price for it because it was considered a witch hunt.


This is less than that..


B) he gets to claim the payoff was for his wife, not the election and cohen already testified under oath trump didn’t know about it. He did it on his own..

That has reasonable doubt written all over it. 

C) you have to look at it like would you feel like it was a witch hunt of it was someone you liked, and you absolutely would."
"I’m am going by what is being reported on cnn and such, your speculating more than me."
"Nobody voted for Obama? My bad, I guess I am dumb."
"I think they all need to be in prison for the rest of their lives. That’s my point. The hush money is nothing compared to the war crimes all of them, including Trump, committed."
"This wasn't equivalent....

Yup. at no point did Obama order his military to bomb civilians.
"I have to agree with you up to a point.  Yes, since the Korean War we haven't been in any justifiable ""police actions"" around the world. The Iran- Contra was a vile CIA operation.  We fought in the Kuwait war against Iraq as paid mercenaries for Kuwait, a supposed ""free"" country. And well you know we just kept the beat up until now.
At least Biden prefers to send money not soldiers.  That's OK for me."
Cornpop?  Really? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
"A) Cohen said that in TV interviews … under oath he said he did it on his own. 

That ruins his credibility and is perfectly reasonable, reasonable doubt. 

 B) I wasn’t even talking about flowers, I was talking about Lewinsky.. 

He was banging his intern in the white house..

Morally that is worse than an affair years back. 


I hate trumps guts , but I want him to go down for something real, that will stick and everyone agrees is F’ed up."
He was a bad dude.
"And that was the end of Clinton, so what's your point? What just happened to Cuomo in NY? Why do you think I'm defending the immoral behavior of Clinton? I'm not, my point was it was different legally. There are now 34 charges against Trump. The jury will decide if they're legit. So be it. But given what we already know about Trump, defending him at all, regardless of conviction, is pathetic."
Show us on the doll where Bill Clinton is currently hurting you
🤣🤣🤣How bad?
">He was a bad dude.

And he's not running for president, so who gives a fuck?   Lets focus on the fascists that are running and make sure they lose."

I don’t think Biden is getting any positive press with clean energy after approval of Willow in Alaska and opening up a huge portion of the Gulf of Mexico to sell for drilling.
An hour west of Durham is a weird way to describe anything in the state. Chatham County and Siler City (mentioned in article) are not an hour away.
"Im so sick of hearing about the “its soo close this time” articles. Let me know when hes arrested, until then stfu."
">In a ruling still under seal, the judge said Mike Pence must appear before a grand jury over conversations he had with Trump leading up to January 6, 2021.

Yep. This is a big deal. Now that the grand jury will be hearing from Trump's top advisors, Pence, and Trump's attorney, there is significant advantage for any of them who feel like they have exposure in the January 6th events to make a deal with DoJ.  

And with a large conspiracy like this, I'm sure their lawyers are telling them, the first ones to make a deal get the best deals.

From what little we've heard, it really does seem like Pence always resisted the notion of stealing the election with Trump's various coup schemes. So Pence won't have any reason to take the fifth. That has to scare the crap out of some of them.

That all being said, we are still likely months away from any indictments."
Treason investigations should be the biggest of his problems.
"I'm so - what is the word I'm looking for here? - grateful?

Disgraced one term former President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice)__ has been indicted. 

March 30, 2023 is a monumental day for many reasons.

Hallelujah!"
"The narcissistic sociopath, __unhinged insurrectionist,__ and grifter (with a pronounced case of logorrhea) known as disgraced one term twice impeached former President Trump will get his comeuppance.

It's a long time coming, IMO.


>*For all the frenzy over a possible indictment of Donald Trump in a New York hush money case, the ex-president’s gravest legal issues, which are deepening by the day, may lie elsewhere.*


And? VP Pence has been avoiding his responsibilities - hearings, depositions and testimony - trying to stay out of it.

But he can't.

He __wrote a book!__

Part of the public domain - and consciousness!

So he *will be testifying.*


>*In an extraordinary development revealed on Tuesday, a federal judge opened the way to a former vice president testifying against the president he served. In a ruling still under seal, the judge said Mike Pence must appear before a grand jury over conversations he had with Trump leading up to January 6, 2021. Such an appearance would allow prosecutors to seek potentially damning evidence, under oath, about fierce pressure Trump imposed on Pence to thwart the transfer of power to President Joe Biden.*

Frankly? I don't care.

Any of disgraced one term twice impeached former President Trump's many crimes will do!

>*Three crushing legal blows against Trump and his lawyers in investigations conducted by special counsel Jack Smith threaten to expose with fresh clarity his conduct in the run up to the US Capitol insurrection and his hoarding of classified documents.*

The wheels of justice do turn slowly. But they are starting to turn.

IMO?

That's a wonderful thing for the USA and the planet."
"This case may be viewed by some as ""the least of tRUmp's legal problems"" by some, but a felony conviction would keep him off any ballot in a NY state election. Even if he doesn't go to prison, he cannot run."
"Seriously. This this case isn’t even the first of his legal troubles, let alone his least. As of this writing there is no case! And the way it’s dragging out I’m starting to thing it’ll be a big nothingburger."
Not gonna win New York anyhow.  So why would this matter?
">This this case isn’t even the first of his legal troubles, let alone his least.

Which case are you talking about? The article's about several of the cases. You can't just read the title."
It might affect how he does in the Republican primary.
New York primary is end of April.  Whoever the candidate is will be determined before New York ever votes.
"I am absolutely certain they will bring up the fact the shooter identified as trans. They won’t bring up the fact they grew up in a “quiet, nuclear family, with religion, religious school( probably didn’t read many of those banned books as a kid either)  Other countries have 2% trans population( and don’t spend monumental time talking about it), drag shows( I went to drag shows in the 70s), a crap ton LESS religion than we do, mental health issues, and more than one entrance door( shooter shot through it, wouldn’t have mattered how many doors), they don’t have more guns than people. BTW? I am a retired firefighter from a major city in the Northeast. I never had a handgun. Admission? I do since I moved to rural America. Most dangerous people I have ever lived around. More crime per capita than Phoenix, 50 plus miles to my East."
Thoughts and prayers.
"Thank God we put a stop to those drag shows, tho.

/s"
They're actually being very vocal about this one specifically because the shooter was trans.
"They never cared about protecting children, they just want to feed their gun fetish all while trying to promote their fake moral superiority over trans people"
Call your representative in Congress and ask what they are doing about it. Imagine if everyone that read your post today did that?
"It's not cognitive dissonance. It's all part of an actual plan. The SBC and think-tanks have gamed it out and we are falling for it hook, line, and sinker. Banning books/drag/trans is to shift focus from SCOTUS striking down Rowe. They don't care about children, they want take over the country. 1/6 was a battle. The war is far from over."
We need to stop using our phones to call around and persuade people to do the right thing and vote out the crazy people. We need to call up news stations that try to push the messages that this isn't a gun issue and clog up their ability to report their propaganda.
"Well, house is much different from them being also concerned about “grooming”  but I also unwilling to vote to end child marriage"
They were literally more offended that kids in art class saw David's marble cock in a book about Michelangelo.
">I am absolutely certain they will bring up the fact the shooter identified as trans


It's the top headline on Fox right now."
"they did it within literal hours of it happening.   
From what I can gather, via BS I am seeing on the mainstream media posts on FB, gay/trans people are now behind every mass shooting that has ever happened and we must STOP THEM NOW!!!"
One narrative I see from right wing outlets is he/they were suffering mental illness🙄. This narrative of blaming the individual instead of the gun is common among right wing ploy. I also noticed the news uses the dead name of the shooter.  It wouldn’t surprise me if something bad happened to the shooter at that school.
The left always brings up white shooters. Everytime there is a poc as the shooter silence. Why is that okay. Also I have been a paramedic for a major city in the northeast. There is at least one shooting and or stabbing a day
They're pro-gun control...specifically for minorities. I wonder why.
"It's not necessarily gun reform. It is deeper-seated than that. It's our culture that glamorizes and fetishizes firearms of all sorts. It also has roots in the way our culture isolates and marginalizes those who are different, and how that isolation can lead to social media echo chambers which trends toward extremist views, culminating in violent, suicidal actions."
"Not a word about anything else though, correct? An entire party based on hate. I was not surprised when DT won( sadly) His movement involved hatred of a fearful, lazy, uneducated ( I can only imagine how someone telling a crowd of GOP’s years ago, “ I love the uneducated” and getting applauded), miserable people. Example? Q-Anon Shaman. Granny, Mom and himself? Never worked. Meth addicts who have lived off of the very system they blame POC and liberal areas for.  They bought it. They will continue to do so. An embarrassment. Sorry I get very emotional about this crap. I don’t like the person I have become living around this. I am moving. They will NOT be changed and they CANNOT be worked with. This isn’t reaching across the aisle material."
"Not surprising. I warned friends of mine in the LGBTQ+ community years ago( I have lived in this shit show since 2010 and have heard it ALL) This will continue to get worse. Voting seems like such a dumb thing to say, but these idiots vote. They get their kids and grandkids ballots ( have for years) and vote for them. Rural area. High crime but few arrests unlike in the city. Gerrymandering has screwed stuff up and will continue to do so. Boycotts? I wish I knew. So so sick of this."
"THIS! I thought immediately the shooter was harmed at school. I am an older lady. I have always been observant and the type of person people share stuff with. For a bunch of people who talk about reproduction and sex as much as they do, biggest bunch of creeps ever. Save the children my ass"
"It's too late to stop it, all we can do is enjoy the ride."

"Clarence Thomas said the SCOTUS is going to be ""looking at"" gay marriage.

Right now he is arguably the most powerful man in the country in a lot of ways."
"I live in Thailand.  The lion share of people give absolutely zero fucks on how a person identifies or who they love.  Everyone is busy with their own life so it's not much of an issue which is great because all the crazy shit going down in America just doesn't  relate here too much. One point in resolution is marriage rights which will be solved at some point in the near future. 

Here's an interesting rub. Recently there has been a western influenced push (and quickly kicked to the curb) that drag shows are demeaning to trans people. Keep in mind these are actually tourist family friendly shows and such that have been around many many years. Many are next level talent as well.

Idk, found it interesting that some in the western movement would take this route given it's a society that is pretty open to things. Seems the push was from angry woke tourists which isn't new, maybe culturally adapting was a challenge or they missed the fight in a place that really doesn't have one.  Some folks just don't want to be happy was my take away."
If Thomas votes to overturn the Equal Protection clause in the 14th amendment not only does gay marriage go so does interracial
"You misspelt the church, dipshit."
"That is slander. Also, you have zero proof to support it making it sueable."
"Even though Thomas is in an interracial marriage, but it's OK for him... 😡"

Never understood the desire to limit speech no matter how repulsive it may be. The problem with this is the gun can be turned on you if others don’t agree with your content.

"What you are describing is editing, editorializing, or moderating content though. ""Restricting or shutting down"" a site, paper, or other media would be censorship, which is not the same. Editing comes from forces within the organization, censorship comes from forces outside; they are not the same thing."
Oh yeah that. It's frightening that when you forgot to mention it my mind instantly brought up 8 to 10 websites that it could be.

>*What you are describing is editing, editorializing, or moderating content though.* 

Nope!"
"Things you say on reddit that can get you kicked off of reddit, that's moderation or editing, not censorship.

A simple question to ask yourself is ""who is doing the speech suppression?"" If it's a business or a group of volunteers suppressing speech of the speaker where they're voluntarily participating by choice, it's editing. If it's the government suppressing speech where the speaker has a right to speak, it's censorship. It's a simplification, but it will get you there 95% of the time."

They can wash and wash but that damned spot will not come out.
I will never understand how anyone can still vote Republican in 2023.
While I do believe we do need reform on gun laws.. it also needs to be noted in the shooters manifesto they said they skipped another school do to it having too much of a “security” presence than the one where the shooting took place. Both gun laws and school security need to be looked at.
Vote Democrat
"Noble sentiment, but this school shooting will be a dumpster fire of kids, religion, and transphobia."
"Wasn't the shooter / murderer a liberal trans activist?  

America needs sensible gun laws no question yet elected public servants from BOTH parties haven't had the stones to do anything for decades now. Dems have had many a chance and just basically refused to do anything of substance outside lip service.  

Nothing is going to change under the corporate sponsored two party system. Why? The people you elect from either party don't want it to."
"Preventing tragedies like this one will require a bottom up approach.  Top down will never happen, meaning we can not vote ourselves safe."
"I think it is kinda dishonest to avoid the rhetoric coming from trans rights activists concerning this event..

I mean they are telling everyone they are killing trans kids by not letting them transition as kids..

No different from the wackos who shot up abortion clinics because of conservatives saying they are murdering babies..

That kind of rhetoric is not free."
"But they still hate this one group that I hate, so I'll continue to vote for them."
"I am going to vote based on merit of a politician, not by party as this makes politicians apathetic and lazy. Why bother if your constituents say ""always vote red"" or ""blue no matter who"". That doesn't work.

I'm going to vote against moral panic, what the most recent school shooter was suffering from along with other mental issues.

I'm going to vote for clarity, transparency not someone who tries to froth potential voters into an irrational biased frenzy.

I'm going to vote for those who are willing to deal with the issues of homelessness and the mental issues amongst those in that community as well as outside of it.

This doesn't leave me much in terms of options but I'm hopeful somebody will emerge. I'm not going to settle. I'm most certainly won't settle based on party lines."
"Before you do your little tweet, ask yourself real quick ""How comfortable are these warm bodies I'm walking on to use to advance my anti-rights political agenda?"" If you do like the feel of squishy blood between your toes, then go ahead and use those dead kids to advance your agenda."

Yes we can. We can vote in legislators that do not kow tow to monied special interests and promote bills that work for the common good. More robust firearm registration and safety training. Red flag laws. Thorough background checks. Money for comprehensive mental health services. These things are not out of reach.

"I just don't understand why more guns aren't solving the gun violence problem.
Weird.

"Wow. That's terrible.

Almost as bad as our gun laws."
"Sadly, the typical Republican will say ""justice served because he died"" and move on to the next one.

They don't care about preventing violence, only about prosecuting it.

In a sane world, the parties would be fighting over different ideas about *how* to reduce gun violence.  Instead, all the ideas come from one side and the other clings to guns like the Liberal majority is about to finally come down upon them."
Occasional Republican voter here. I don’t see this a win despite the suggestions. Very sad to see
So sad
Here we go again! 😡
Where are the french-style protests?

Ammosexuals on the march
It’s actually hilarious reading this thread compared to the conservative post of the exact same thing. They have 10x more engagement and the comments actually address the problem and have civil conversations about opportunities to improve our society. I only saw the word liberal maybe once out of hundreds of comments. Then you look at this and it’s all negative comments about republicans and how it’s everything and everyone else’s fault. There’s not even 100 comments and more than half of them are just whining about something other than reasonable input. This is coming from someone not on either side so just makes you think.
Another mass shooting but the Republicans and the NRA will never learn.
"Tldr- the gun they used had parts that anti-gun parties wanted banned (pistol brace ban), so did the Las Vegas shooter (bump stock ban)

Conspiracy theory warning - but around the time a gun or gun mod is about to get sent up to the law makers to get banned there is a shooting of some sort using said “banned” mod. Very convenient."

Why is “multiple” in quotations in the headline?
Guns in my area
They hate public schools and love guns.  School shootings are a total win-win for them.
"Well, while easy access to guns is making this easier to accomplish, we cant ignore how much this has increased in the last 30 years. There *is* a problem in our society that we need to solve that just taking and making guns illegal will not fix."
"Look at the history. Every-times government takes guns away, dictators come to power. What needs to be done is we need to do something to fix the mental health issue in this country. This is including them not having access to guns. To take guns from everyone is overkill."
It’s the bad place
America is nice. Americans are fucking stupid.
It was a 28 year old woman
It is known
We are exceptional. In gun violence statistics....
Problem is not enough good guys. /s
You need good kindergarteners with guns
The shooter was a woman.
why would you vote republican?  i would love to know what they offer that is worth the dead children and hate
"I think its more a representation of the app were on.

Based on responses I’m reading here and on /r democrats, it feels like everyone is just…younger. I’d be real interested to know the average age of each subforum (not to prove point, just to keep in mind when arguing)"
Bodies drop like Malaria
This shooting is at a private school.
"Not only a private school, but a private *Christian* school.

EDIT: spelling 😊"
Every dead child is a triumph of the second amendment.
"Australia saw a 50% decrease in gun related homicide after its '90s gun regulations were passed, as well as a 60% decrease in teen suicide. Let's go ahead and make an attempt at regulating gun ownership and see where that goes."
"Less guns, less deaths.
It ain't hard cipherin'..."
Trans woman at that.
"She

My response was sorta generic"
"bio woman, trans man...."
"I agree with a lot of their criticisms of the left, but don't always buy in to their solutions. I'd prefer ranked choice voting so I could vote more along the lines of what I truly would like to see. I supported Andrew Yang for example.

I think if you open up a little you'll see that most republicans are just normal people that you can disagree with but still value as a person. I get there are lunatics, they aren't hard to find. But the vast majority of Americans are horrified at these deaths."
How much money do you have in your bank account?
Absolutely correct.  But this is an anomaly.  A sacrifice Republicans are willing to make if it hurts the public schools worse.
"I'm all for that, but the people of this country would sooner tear out one of thier eyes then let go of any of thier guns."
"Ah ok. Understood 

But yes, you’re right about what you said."
I think it was a trans woman actually... Confusing information so far
Only half of the vast majority of Americans want to fix this issue. Guess which? Not your half.
The first reasonable person i’ve seen on reddit
"I’m curious whats bad about the left that justifies the dead children and hate promoted ny the right.  and yes I agree there are extremists on both sides.  But from where I am sitting most moderate left leaning people want equality, freedom, safety and kindness.  

what I have seen from even moderately right republicans is the desire to protect the white class, restrict freedoms(they don’t agree with) make safety impossible if you aren’t white and rich and least of all disallows kindness

I struggle to see what is sooo dangerous about the left to justify voting to the right.  Like really really struggle and your answer isn’t helping me understand it either.  would love to hear specifics."
"I want to chime in to say that I moved to SD about a decade ago. When I got here, I was pleasantly surprised to find that yes indeed there actually are republicans that aren't monsters. (Having grown up in West Texas, it really was a surprise.) However, over the past several years I have watched these conservatives sort of retract into themselves, if I can put it that way. The spread of trump flags, thin blue line tshirts and Black Rifle coffee hoodies is just an outward sign of the tribalism that is taking hold of these people. The KKK is alive & thriving here, I hear the N word and other dehumanizing terms on a regular basis. Guns are at the top of most people's minds, it is nigh impossible to have a conversation without it soon becoming the topic. I deliver for  living, and the number of  Confederate flag stickers I see on people's cars as I drive around is just mind boggling! This is recent, like in the past year or so.  Don't get me started on the everyday homo- & trans- phobia & as the mother of a trans person I live in terror for her every time she leaves the house. 
What I'm trying to say is: there may have been a time when you were right, that republicans were just people with different opinions. I don't think that's true anymore. I think they have become truly dangerous people with no care for anyone but themselves & their own values."
"Do you think they'll care ""more"" now that it was a private school? Or pretend somehow to care more?"
"This shows how a 'big lie' works so well.
They propose banning *sales* of assault weapons, lots go straight to 'their a' coming to take my guns', just like the nra and the gun manufacturers planned.. keep you scared and buying more.."
"To add a personal anecdote: 
Recently I listened to a coworker tell our black coworker that racism is over, doesn't happen anymore. And that she herself has experienced worse racism than any black person because she is white. Now this woman is not a fanatic. She's just a regular sampling of normal folk here in RC, SD. I wanted to share this as an example of how the average conservative around here thinks. She is far from being an outlier. When I raised a fuss when a different coworker used the N word, the majority of our  coworkers chimed in to defend him. That's just how it is."
"Oh, they're going to make a HUGE stink about how much they care. This is Tennessee and the shooter is trans and they shot up a Christian school in a city that is Democrat run. This is a gold mine for the local Republicans from a PR point of view. Mind you, they won't actually do anything to prevent another shooting, but they will use it as an excuse to further discriminate against the LGBT community."
They will *never* listen. *Ever*.

"Well looking at our track record I'd say she's quite Presidential. No worries though, DeSantis will be president, she'll probably just be his running mate."
And here I was gonna guess that she's in cahoots with non-hemp rope material growers!
"Your 'track record' as a state is an embarrassment to the other 49, and she has her head so far up trumps ass that her shoulders are orange.."
Well her sister in law probably has a best farm and can turn that into rope. Business is done through Dwight schrute of course....
"Oh, I meant our track record as a country, when you consider the past several decades of republican presidents."
"Tell me about it. I worked at My Rushmore in 2020 when she had the Trump rally there. I got to see a picture of the abomination of a statue she gave him, with his face on the monument. Cunty Noam is a nightmare but she's what these assholes want. They gave us Trump, they reelected her, they're definitely gonna for e DeSantis on us too. That's what passes for presidential."
"

Absolutely concur"
"She's Sarah Palin, without the intellect.."
At least you could laugh at Palin. Cunty just makes me stare in wide-eyed horror.
"You technically could. They've done this before with both vaccinating children and the drinking age. So you could, in theory, tie abortion access to Medicare funding. 

However, the issue with that is that republicans already want to get rid of Medicare anyways. Defunding their medicare programs would just give them an excuse to leave them in squalor, effectively eliminating them without having to face the political backlash of doing so, since they could just point to the federal government as the bad guy.

But beyond that, it'd require congress to pass a budget that changes the allocation of those funds or puts those stipulations into place. With the current republican House, I don't see something like that happening."
"They could potentially start positioning it to get a response out the voters. A lot of the states that are pulling this crap also relie on Medicaid and other federal subsidies which could be threatened to be pulled.

Just a thought."

Thank you Grace Linn.

"From the article:

“I think he’s corrupt.First of all, he recused himself from the Zignego case because of ethical concerns.Then he took twenty thousand bucks from Zignego and his family.After he got the money, he un-recused himself so he could judge the case.That’s not something a judge with any ethics would do.”"
'Both sides' is a Con talking point
They conflate positive representation  of trans people with encouraging children to be trans.
"It’s just intellectual laziness. 
These are people who can’t actually be bothered to follow any issues, or know how things actually work. 
It’s easier to simply say what she did and get back to scrolling for reinforcing memes. 
If some people are made homeless, commit suicide, lose healthcare, etc. because these are, in fact, issues that affect real people, “oh, well. Probably their fault/ FJB.”"
They are gaslighting. I’m not even sure they know what they mean.
"They'll point to actual leftists, anarchists, people who want to abolish the police who are more likely to not vote for Democrats than vote for them. Basically, the fringe who make up a vanishingly small portion of the electorate and compare it to mainstreamed white/Christian/cis/straight/nativist supremacy apologism."
"There are wackos on both sides. But! On one side, there are very few wackos in positions of actual power, while the other side consists mostly of wackos. The result is the lunatics running the asylum."
"They think that we are wackos for supporting anything that doesn't conform to Christianity and gender norms, such as supporting trans people, being atheists, etc."
It is how to ignore the insane people on the right wing.  As the right wing puts their insane people in charge while the left doesn't.
"I've had Conservative friends say AOC is a radical wacko because of how she talks back, and the Green New Deal. I think it's the all or nothing thinking. She seems to think 'slowly phasing in green energy' means ""get rid of your car right now."" 

To me it seems to be a completely different thought process. Fundamental differences. So, politicians I think are mild, are extreme to her-- but only on the progressive side. Some of my former Republican friends said ""both sides"" when they didn't want to hear about their own wackos, like MGT. They stopped the conversation at that point."
"My mom thinks the liberal public schools are working for big pharma, convincing kids they’re trans so they can make money off of the treatment. SOOOOOOOOO."
"The only ""people"" who claim that ""both sides"" are the same in any aspect are the assholes on the right"
"Ask her for one example where the 'other side"" wants to take away people's rights."
"Liberals make people read and like, be aware another entire life exists at the ends of their firearm."
">Her response? “Wackos on both sides”. What’s the equivalent coming from liberals in their eyes?


Her comment is a false equivalency, a logical fallacy.

And it's really difficult to change MAGA minds because they seem to think in various logical fallacies. 

It's like when they use whataboutism or strawman arguments. In their minds, those are reasonable arguments. Even though they are logical fallacies.

So it's a significant critical reasoning problem. You can't fix it for her."
[“Fine people on both sides.”](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/08/trump-defends-white-nationalist-protesters-some-very-fine-people-on-both-sides/537012/)
That's just a super lazy form of whataboutism lol.
I am a liberal. Biden supported the train owners not the train workers.
"The Republican party has lost its mind - they just aren't thinking straight. I remember when I was a kid they could at least talk to each other and compromise 

It's all fear - fox news and others just try to scare their audience Into falling in line with the conservative think tank

It's sad but I really do think it's going to have to collapse until something else can be reborn in it's ashes that can function as a solid 2nd party 

we need more strong parties and honestly I think we need about 5 parties in this country eventually 

It's a fuckin mess man, My sister has been radicalized over the past couple of years due to the pandemic and her daughter coming out as trans...it's made talking to her super difficult at times"
Conservatives hate being shown their inherent hypocrisy so frequently say oh well there are bad people on both sides to deflect the topic
"This is classic bothsidesism and a variant of Whataboutism. These are toxic forms of communication. 

The difference is this - the fucking inmates run the Republican Party now. The party was already well on its way to Hell but Trump fully broke it. Now the craven, hypocrites and traitors in republican leadership try and explain away coups and power grabs as just politics. 

The Democrats are just shit. That’s the main difference. The Democratic Party is not hostage to their looniest extremes, they’re just mediocre right of center warmed up shit. Their greatest failing is not - as a party - uniting behind the message that the Republican Party has been body snatched  by extremist psychopath losers."
"The few that come to mind are Defund the Police, Climate Change Proponents, Eat the Rich…people who use extreme rhetoric to advocate for not murdering citizens, destroying the planet, and having half the country a bill away from bankruptcy while some people have more money than would be literally possible to spend in a lifetime"
"Because there are. 

But from your responses, you don’t seem to think that she could possibly have a point. If you actually asked her, instead of a liberal sub on Reddit, you might get an answer."
"Yes, there are wackos on the far edges of both sides. On the right there are the ones who feel gun ownership should include military weapons intended for war and believe Trump was a good president, and on the left we have the Identity Politics/Critical Social Justice ones who try to push ideas like there is no such thing as the biological reality of male and female, only European descendants are racist, and want to expose children to the concerns of adult sexuality.

Edit: I feel I should add, though, that in terms of danger to society, the right is far far worse, as it results in actual death, poverty, and chaos; the primary cause of death for children in the USA is gun violence.  The left's extremism is largely an impediment to actual progress against racism, sexism, and bigotry against gays and lesbians. And it's annoying. So, big difference."
"The biggest danger on our side is the rapid rise of authoritarianism boarding on fascism since Covid. The vaccine mandates, firing people for not getting a vaccine they didn’t need (yes not everyone needed it and many people shouldn’t have gotten it and are suffering from it), justin Trudeau freezing assets of lower and middle class truck drivers for peacefully protesting, controlling speech, changing speech, suppressing freedom of speech, censorship. Censorship is a very serious issue that we have been willfully allowing because it hasn’t yet affected our side, but it will come for all of us. All of these trends point towards our side accepting authoritarianism and trending towards fascism."
"I’m not sure how any reasonable person cannot understand exactly what she meant without putting almost any effort into thinking about it. As a liberal, I’m not a leftist, and I’m definitely not a right wing nut job, but it’s *extremely* obvious to me that there are insane, insufferable people on both sides. 

The right is much more toxic and insane. We all know that. But the left has people insane enough to believe that it’s acceptable for biological males to compete against biological females in organized athletics, despite the fact that biological females do not want this and that most people recognize it as absurdly unfair. Any reasonable person knows this without giving it much thought, yet there are leftists who will outrageously and idiotically accuse you of being transphobic or hateful if you write this fact in a public online space such as Reddit.

You also have catch-phrases like “all cops are bad” that don’t do the left any favors. I’m not sure how closed-minded one has to be not to recognize the toxicity on both sides, but it definitely disturbs me when I see people *who aren’t right wing nut jobs* failing to grasp this basic truth.

It’s like… some people are afraid to admit that there are insane, toxic people who are ruining society on both sides, as if that will lead to a false equivalency. No. Don’t worry about that. Everybody knows that the right is the side of absolute batshit insanity and stupidity and overwhelming hatred. But to pretend that the left doesn’t have some really psychotic shit going on at the same time… that’s just ridiculous.

*takes breath*

All that said, blurting out “both sides” is still a stupid thing to say, and it’s most often (but not always) misleading when someone says it.

My point is that it’s a very dangerous blind spot not to notice that the left has some really stupid people on it."
I am sure they can find some Tweet that is objectively crazy and build a strawman of the left around it.
Tell her you need to see her sources
Just go on ask conservatives. They feel that we are pushing this to an extreme.
"I think the extreme response to the Hogwarts Legacy game is a rare example of “wackos” on the liberal side. The whole you’re either with us or against us ideology to the point where so-called liberals where bullying other liberals on social media over this video game. However, in typing this out, it occurs to me that such an extreme stance seems more like the right so there may have been some bad actors mixed in there that got the whole movement started. 

Then there are the isolated people who believe things like if you wouldn’t date a trans person you’re transphobic, etc etc. 

However, wackos on both sides is highly inaccurate as the side of the right is current 99% wackos!"
"They are trying to justify their actions by saying others also do bad things. 

This is a stupid argument. If a bank robber tried to justify their actions by saying other people jack cars we would laugh them out of the room."
"Your sister didn't have a comeback and doesn't have a logical argument, but is standing with conservatives even though it is wrong. 

She's chosen the ideology over reason and family, and is now thorougly invested in idiology. I'm sorry, but she's not a good person anymore."
"Lack of any attempt to implement any change for working class people. Were there dems or reps in power working class was oppressed anyway.

Lobbying works and 64% live paycheck to paycheck, wealth distribution is immense, the party that attracts most donors always win, the study even shown that it doesnt matter even if MAJORITY of population supports some bill/law/legistlation it wont be passed if rich 10% disagree. But if 10% rich support and 90% dont it will almost certainly pass.

It is oligarchy, plain and simple, votes are meaningless and rich write the laws and elect officials.

So people just lost faith, simple."
It means she doesn't want to defend the right-wing.  She says both sides but that means she's supporting and voting conservative anyway.
"DO NOT ENGAGE
DO NOT ENGAGE"
"Again, bothsidesism and whataboutism are what Cons do to deflect and minimize the bat shit craziness on their side"
It’s the argument people use when they have no valid response to something.
"This is simple, in 2016 Invasion of the Body Snatchers occurred, our friends and family members are gone.  I lost my only beloved sister to the Trumpy MAGA Qanon Cult, trying to talk and be sisters became heartbreaking. She became so out of touch with reality, her cruelty new no bounds.  I am a trained hostage negotiator, if I could not rescue her, no one can.  Many of my colleagues have experienced this phenomenon.  Some choose to maintain relationships via avoiding current political situations.  This choice is false.  Good people on both sides truly does not exist. Just ask the Russian people who don’t want to talk politics. You may choose not to be in involved in politics, but, believe me politics will be involved with you. Government Overreach is on the move fueled with billions of dollars for the takeover of EVILgelicals Christian Nationalist Movement.  You need to choose between hope or hate.  Slava Ukraini Heroiam Slava just a friend from Kentucky."
"This is the right answer. It's called a bothsiderism and is an attempt to distract people from the awful shit conservatives think and do.     

They make the claim that both sides are bad so your bad stuff offsets our bad stuff.      

But only one side ever says both sides are the same."
"Jeffrey Dahmer killed and ate 13 people. Also, my neighbor was jaywalking.

Conservatives: See! They're BOTH criminals!"
"Lack of empathy.  They can't grasp the concept of advocating for a service you don't plan to use yourself,  or a benefit that does not apply to yourself.

This is also what leads to ""allow abortion"" = ""all pregnancies should be terminated"" and BLM = ""kill all whites."""
"Yes, but I don't think that's what she means. I think his sister is simply saying there are wackos who are Republican and Democrat that do harmful things to innocent people. But I also think that, in general, conservatives use the both sides argument knowing that the right is far more tolerant of their wackos than the left, in other words, they'll still vote for their wackos while most on the left won't continue to vote for theirs. Matt Gaetz and Al Franken are good examples of this double standard."
"When you don't understand how gender identity or orientation works, then that's exactly what happens."
"more to the point, they don't know what the definition of conflate is."
those reinforcing memes are what my republican family and extended family seem to base their politics on. it's infuriating. I'm one of the only liberals in my white family. ( wifes black and liberal also) I went a different direction than my whole family. i consider myself very open-minded.
Mic drop!
I challenge you to listen to Nancy Pelosi and make this statement again.
"It’s purely tribal programming. Conservative thought, often steeped in religious indoctrination is not about asking questions which can lead to challenging the status quo. 

Conservatives are the status quo. That’s all they care about “conserving” a mythical golden age that never really existed except for a small in group and only briefly

Therefore Conservatism is uniquely useless at solving the incredible challenges faced in the 21st century by EVERYONE. 
Therefore, if we are to survive as a species beyond the next century, conservatism, in its current form, must be defeated every step of the way. It’s just simply not helpful, in fact, it’s incredibly harmful survival as a species. 

Unfortunately, conservatives don’t really care about data, the results, what works, they are only interested in “winning“ at all costs. They have no interest is society at large, our fellow humans in other countries (unless it’s to take their resources) only the religion of their ideology, toxic individualism, supply-side economics, the handful of nonsense they repeat like dogma."
"They'll just respond with ""big tech"" and ""cancel culture"" because they have zero working brain cells."

Yeah I’m slowly starting to realize that. She’s a nurse. Worked labor and delivery for over a decade. Helped me give birth to my kids. I’ve slowly starting thinking I used to know her but I just don’t anymore. That girls gone.
I appreciate your advice. It really comes down to condoning hate or rejecting it. I’m going with the latter. Cannot believe she and I grew up in the same house. Blows my mind.
"Yep, the term I use is False Equivalency-there is only ONE POLITICAL PARTY that’s tearing at the seems of our fragile Democracy….and it’s not even close"
Bothsiderism is much like whataboutism.. Cons..
The person who replied to you supports the U.S. right wing just because the U.S. supported the right wing in his country. He literally just wants people to suffer no matter the individuals role in politics or innocence.
"The party that attracts more money always win. Lobyists support parties. Research shown that the chances of passing a law/bill/legislation correspond with who supports it. If 10% rich support it passes, if they dont it wont.

It doesnt matter if 90% poorer support anything, it is not up to them.

So rich elect officials, write laws and pass them. It is oligarchy, plainly obvious and simple.

People lost faith.

Republicans get a lot of revenge votes from oppresed working, uneducated class. They want you to feel how they feel, and I understand that and even support that."
"New york didn't do the liberals any favors when they passed a law enshrining the absolute  right to abortion on demand up until the moment of birth in law the day after roe was overturned. It gave ammunition to the both sides argument, when as we all know no one wants a third trimester abortion, if one happens tragedy has already struck. 

But i think empathy has a place in the conservative argument too. Any woman will tell you puberty wasn't fun. Bleeding, cramping, uncontrollable hormones hijacking your brain. I think when the conservative women saw so many children suddenly out as trans men especially, they saw hurting kids in the hardest time of their lives being told it was okay to just take a hormone blocker and not have to go through all that bullshit. I think it hit home because if they could have skipped all that they would have been sorely tempted."
Eh.  That has less to do with voters and more to do with having to live up to an expectation of integrity.  Al Franken resigned when he shouldn't have.  No Republican will bat an eye that Butthead didn't resign.
"Which is why it is not the civil rights issue of our time because very few people actually understand, even tolerant and sympathetic people, ie natural allies….who often get attacked for not being fully on board. Which is obviously asinine and self defeating."

"Except it doesn’t happen, it’s purely a moneymaker for the gun industry, after every Democratic win gun sales soar."
"This response is perfect. It reinforces the banality we have towards these very serious trends. We are drifting towards wanting to ban unvaccinated, trump voters from society."
"No, it doesn’t. And that kind of response is unhelpful and dishonest. Gathering that from my response is disingenuous and misleading. How can you not understand that reacting this way in these situations is like pouring fuel on the fire for the right wing nut jobs? I can take the disrespect, because I think know where you’re coming from, and I think your intentions are good, but you’re not being real, and people on both sides pick up on that. You should avoid that.

The goal is to be on the side of reason and truth. Neither the left nor the right own that. If you can’t admit that there are people on the left who are willfully stoking outrage with unreasonable points of view, you’re being dishonest about reality.

I’ve already conceded that it was a cheap move for your sister to toss out the false equivalence fallacy. But don’t blind yourself to the faults of the left. The most extreme leftists may not be as harmful as the most extreme right wingers, but to pretend they don’t exist, and that they’re not having a negative impact on society, is dangerous.

If you can admit this while arguing with someone who is on the right, you’re able to reel them in enough to consider your point of view and potentially change their mind in a positive way. If you’re dishonest and unreasonable with them, it just antagonizes them and entrenches them further in their madness."
It's very like the victims of romance scams that can't believe they are victims of scams.
"> New york didn't do the liberals any favors when they passed a law enshrining the absolute right to abortion on demand up until the moment of birth in law the day after roe was overturned

"As we can see from u/KarmicComic12334 , a lot of the GOP/republican/fascists hate for regular Americans comes from misinformation and the inability to look at logic and facts and change their position.  It’s a very similar personality trait as lack of empathy."
It’s all so hateful and ugly. I don’t understand how someone can throw their morals aside and justify condone and support it.
"1. I heard it on npr morning edition, with a speech from gov. Huchel saying exactly that abortion was and would always be legal until birth in ny state. I don't have a link and every likely google result is paywalled, but i tend to trust nor to at least tell me when they are lying to me(a reference to the early days of the Afghanistan invasion when they were ordered to quash a story but made sure everyone knew they had been ordered to quash the story they couldn't talk about anymore.

2. Fact, i have never spoken to a cis woman who didn't acknowledge that if it had been an option they would have considered it."
"Read my whole comment and stop building strawmen. Yes, near term abortions are legal in ny with doctors recommendations. It is mostly meant to prevent carrying still births."
"In a hundred years, we'll have a pill that inverts your genitalia turning a penis into a vagina and nuts into ovaries and vis versa. Everybody will give it a try. Until then, people will get hung up on which genitals get to wear which clothes and do which jobs."
"No one here has posted facts, only questioned mine. And perhaps calling anything short of toeing the party line hate is the extremism on the other side they call out.

I mean I'm sorry i cant find the soundbyte, but when ny passed the law the governor gave a speech that aired on morning edition. I cringed at the 5 am airing, and doubly so when i confirmed i had heard that at the 7 am airing, because it was so off tone. The actual wording of the law is not as bad as what they said, but it was bad."
That’s just straight up wrong. Just google the abortion laws in NY. Up to 24 weeks (third trimester is week 27) and beyond 24 weeks if the mothers health was in immediate crisis before overturn. So stop spreading lies and misinformation please.

Is that a strawman too?"
They are legal if the fetus is dead or dying or risk of death to the Mother. If it is a viable late term fetus they do c sections and can save both

oh and ummm this is an hour long!"
"Let me ChatGPT that for you.  But watch.. when presented with facts and evidence, you will stick to your guns  and do exactly what i described… In New York, the Reproductive Health Act (RHA) was signed into law on January 22, 2019. This law updated New York's previous abortion law, which had been in effect since 1970. Under the RHA, women have the right to access abortion up to 24 weeks of pregnancy for any reason, as long as the procedure is performed by a licensed healthcare provider.

After 24 weeks, abortions are only legal in New York if they are necessary to protect the woman's life or health or if the fetus is not viable. This is based on Section 2599-bb of the New York Public Health Law, which states:

""An abortion may be performed by a licensed, certified, or authorized practitioner within 24 weeks from the commencement of pregnancy, or there is an absence of fetal viability, or at any time when necessary to protect a patient's life or health.""

The law defines ""absence of fetal viability"" as a condition where ""an attending physician, after examining the patient and upon reasonable medical judgment, determines that the fetus is not viable."" This determination must be made in accordance with accepted medical standards and practices.

It's important to note that abortions after 24 weeks are rare and are only performed in cases where the woman's life or health is at risk or the fetus has a severe abnormality. Additionally, the RHA requires that such abortions be performed by licensed, qualified healthcare providers in a hospital, or a licensed and regulated outpatient clinic.

In summary, under New York law, women have the right to access abortion up to 24 weeks of pregnancy for any reason. After 24 weeks, abortions are only legal if they are necessary to protect the woman's life or health or if the fetus is not viable, and must be performed by licensed healthcare providers in accordance with accepted medical standards and practices."
"As i said, i have never once spoken to another cis woman about this subject who would not have considered it if it was an option. not even my own mother who entered a convent and became a nun to escape puberty. But no, o never met a trans man who admitted that was their reason. And i will admit to having more respect for trans women >40 than trans men <20, go ahead and cancel my young adult fiction about a young wizard. Ignore that i was there supporting a trans youth in 1992 when there were no options available."
"They are legal if a doctor  signs iff on them, we agree those are good reasons for a doctor to sign off on them, but the speech announcing the law was cringe  even for the furthest leftist. I wish i could sight it."
No.
"That is exactly what the law says, and we were already on the same side. But a badly phrased press conference sticks in the memory. It was on npr morning edition and i can only imagine what right wing propaganda did with it, but the phrase ""abortion on demand at any time"" was uttered by the governor and it was so tone deaf i cringed twice(at the 5 am and 7am broadcast, i drive for a living and usually let the news play out rather than listen to guffaws until stations okay music at 10 am)"
"I think you make stuff up, but what do I know..

Good luck"
"I would imagine the disconnect is that anti abortion folks dont understand what late term abortion is or why laws have updated. It's a matter of urgent crisis. Instead of requiring 2 or 3 doctors to sign off PLUS a hospital board which takes days, a Dr in an emergency situation can do whatever it takes to save the Mother asap with no legal complications"
i have agued in good faith based on my personal experience. But I don't put much value in your statements either.

Seriously, good luck!"

"Bad headline, should be “trump calls for death and destruction if indicted”"
I said this on another sub but will say it again... I am ready for death and destruction if that's the only way this a$$hat ends up in prison!

Ample corporate structure destruction, also okay.

Let’s add menacing to the list of charges. They should ship his orange ass to Romania and lock him up with Andrew Tate.
God took Lance Reddick and left us with this guy. WTH.
All that's happening in my house when it happens is that I am cracking a bottle of crystal I have been sitting on for this occasion.
Trump is once again threatening and inciting stochastic terrorism. This method of inciting terrorism needs to be identified and punished by law as a criminal offense.
"""who got more votes than any sitting President in history""

Doesn't matter what your score is if the other person has more."
It's not a warning it's a threat.

"Imagine that. A likely criminal doesn’t want to deal with due process and the consequences of his actions, and tries to intimidate his way out of it. Surprise, surprise."
He does not care about America as a country at all. It is shameful that he was president.
If it starts another Civil War I guess we'll just have to win that one too.
great... fine... let's fucking get on with it already
He feels the walls closing in on him.
He doesn't realize his base has shrunk. And his base doesn't realize the rest of us also have guns. And most of us are better trained than they are.
BRING IT ON BITCH!!
"Well he's now threatening mass domestic terrorism. Somebody please bite the bullet, and take him out while he's having dinner at a restaurant, or sitting on his balcony or whatever I don't wanna be the one to do it but I will."
Is there a more miserable being walking on the face of this earth than this loser? I really don’t think so. I believe Kari Lake is a close 2nd and Putin gets 3rd place.

If you or I had committed just one of the crimes that he's being accused of? We would be in handcuffs in front of a judge  with a lawyer, and we would have to answer for our crimes.

Do they need to re-write laws about Presidents or ex-Presidents who commit crimes? 

So that it is clear?

All men are created equally.

No matter what disgraced one term former President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice)__ and his sycophants think.

Lock him up.
Trump warns that there will be no Christmas if he’s indicted.
Cartman was actually very clever sometimes.
Oh your tears are so yummy and sweet!
The Narcissism of this POS is off the scales
Trump promises he would be sad and would want to die if indicted.
No. Of course not. He's a wimp.
Personally I hope there are riots in my town. I’ve never been able to go looting but I’d really like to get some peppers and stuff.
I don't want anyone to get hurt in political violence but we all have a vested interest in preserving the rule of law in this country. The fear of threats is not a valid reason for our justice system to make decisions and we can't let that become one.
Yep.  If his followers want to die for him that’s on them.

I hear that. All of us antifa folk could really use some free stuff.

Yeah. It's really about coming up and staying on top.

"Exactly.

Once he left the Presidency he became a *private citizen* and must be treated as such.

People were afraid of him *long before he ever became President.*

This is not an absolute monarchy, even though he pretty much considers himself king/emperor.

He has never been held accountable, not once.

I have taken heat for this, and will take heat again, but it changes nothing: *he will not be charged federally because Merrick Garland is afraid of him.* 

There is precious little evidence to contradict that."
"Merrick Garland openly states he doesn't want to be the first AG to indict a former President.

Now with this NY thing: ""It's coming!"" ""We'll get him this time!"" ""Just you wait!""

And then it never happens...nor is it likely to..."
But was he coooooollllll?
100%!
"Merrick Garland is in the back ground.

As always.

Betwwen Fulton County DA Fani Willis, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin L. Bragg and Special Council Jack Smith?

The wheels of justice are turning.

He will answer for his crimes soon."
"Garland turned out to be such a weak, limp-wristed, milquetoast enabler it's sad. It's a shame we got 3 Trump justices on SCOTUS but in a way it's a good thing we got Jackson instead of Garland."
Yikes! I hadn’t heard that Garland had said that. I just thought he was going out of his way to not look political.
"Citation?
P.S. So no citation from this troll that Merrick Garland has said what he claims he said."
"If he doesn't, and he sleazes his way back into the WH, the country is basically done for.

Thus far, all I have heard out of Garland is musing how ""unprecedented"" it would be to indict a former President and how he doesn't want to be the first AG to do so.

I've had some hope for DA Bragg and the NY charges, but now *that* seems to have gone cold, and I have not heard much to speak of about Georgia.

He has never been held accountable in his life. He has bribed, scared and just pushed his way through everything, *because he knows he can get away with it*.

If I sound alarmed and scared to death, it is because I am alarmed and scared to death.

All I can say is I really, really hope you are correct and I am wrong."
You're not wrong.
"That's absurd.
P.S. The rant in the response to this comment is also absurd, and has no bearing on the beyond ridiculous claim that Merrick Garland not being on the SCOTUS outweighs three radical right-wingers who are."
"He has said that, as well as just musing about how ""unprecedented"" it would be to indict a former President.

TL/DR: He's scared of Trump."
Why do you believe he said that just because someone on Reddit says so?
Has it happened yet?
"They are actually trying to change the laws around the country so that DAs can be controlled and / or fired if they try to prosecute cases that the Republicans don't approve of.

The State of Georgia is right up there.

>*This week, Georgia joined the ranks of states proposing bills to impose statewide oversight on local prosecutors and even remove them from office if they fall out of favor with the ruling party. SB 92, which passed the Georgia Senate 32-24 on Thursday, would create a Prosecuting Attorneys Qualifications Commission composed of gubernatorial and legislative appointees empowered to “discipline, remove, and cause involuntary retirement of appointed or elected district attorneys or solicitors-general” for “mental or physical incapacity,” “willful misconduct in office,” or “willful and persistent failure to carry out duties.”*

That's just...

Unimaginable.

That it is actually happening.

All because disgraced one term former President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice)__ is a criminal.

And he is afraid.

"Hi there! Congress has not yet released the official text since it is so new. But the bill has been introduced with the purpose of explicitly creating a new office “The Office of Gun Violence Prevention” within the DOJ in order to formally oversee and work towards pushing gun violence prevention solutions. You can view the status of the bill and that Congress has not yet released full details on this webpage:

This is the most ridiculous crap I ever heard of. Sure let's send federal tax dollars from blue states to fascist seditious traitors in red states WITH NO OVERSIGHT OR REGULATIONS
The private education industry is behind that.  Using the religious right as a tool to dumb down public education.
"This is such a dumb strategy.  They’re falling all over themselves to win the primary by being the most extreme possible, thereby setting themselves up to get destroyed in 2024.  I can’t wait for the Republican primary to really heat up.  Got my popcorn ready."
So walls.  They work or they don't work?
Rufo is nothing more than a slightly educated reactionary grifter. He loves the attention the far right is giving him.  It is his latest addiction.  I hope he understands that he is nothing more than a fascist enabler but I doubt he is smart enough to realize that in his simplistic world view.
Take nothing for granted. Register and vote.
Absolutely in the long run you are correct. I don't know if it will happen quite as soon as you think it will. The demographics of this country at this point are such that Republicans cannot win legitimately. So while in the long run you are correct in the short run they're going to cause a lot of damage. They feel like they are cornered dogs and will act as such. But yes I think that 50 years from now we will have a much better country for everyone. But in the meantime things are going to get shitty. January 6th 2021 is just one example.

Soon as they start voting, the Republican Party is done. And they know it too. Hence all the voting suppression bills and gerrymandering. Their days are numbered."
"The Republican Party has been hollowed out since Nixon got his pardon from Ford - and no one dared to raise hell about it. Reagan had one of the most scandal filled White Houses in history, but he is still revered by even the most traditional Republicans today.

The one good thing that Trump has done is to open up the putrefying carcass so the world could see the decaying bones of the Republican Party."
"Every presidential election cycle, each party has thier platform. Usually it can be boiled down to a handful of bullet points, reasons why you should vote for their presidential candidate and party.

The Republicans haven't had a platform since candidate trump in 2015. There is no reason to vote for any one of them."
"Moments like this play out very slowly, up until they happen all at once."
"They're in their ""death throws"", like the fossil fuel industry. Watch for the most desperate grasps ever- like worrying about drag queens. Watch for bullshit like injecting more religion at every turn to try to grasp for support. A lot of us are done with people who use religion to shore up their social standing."
"The end of the party OR the end of our democracy, for a good while. They'll choose who can vote and take away rights to get there.

Don't be complacent - we see what happened with RvW- everyone just assumed it would never be overturned. The fact that it was a long 40 year grind for them means we got used to it and just labeled them the crazies, so ehrn it actually became a threat, we just assumed it would never pan out. 

Register to vote, encourage everyone you know to register, and get in the habit. Every election, big and small."
"They realized the point you made about Religion dwindling in the US at least 15 years ago and some  pivoted to the Tea Party, which some say lead to the MAGA Republican. Religion is now supplemented with anti-lgbtq, “Anti-woke”, anti-immigration, anti-college, anti-etc.

Politicians are excellent at understanding their market, and they’ll continue to pivot to whatever belief gets votes. They will twist the narrative, and demonize Democrats. Educated voters lean democratic? Attack education. Gay voters lean democratic? Well they can’t denounce gay voters, that’s almost too far for the average Republican. But trans acceptance is a “democratic viewpoint”, and they have no problem demonizing trans people. There is always an enemy to make.

My point is not to underestimate the hoops they’ll jump through to manipulate the country. The closer they get to this eternal defeat you’re predicting, the more dangerous they will be."
Your post is pretty spot on. Honestly the only way they can win is either through gerrymandering or having rulings done through the Supreme Court. I’d keep an eye on Republicans because their push with religious beliefs seem to be in overdrive.
The Republican Party has been bleeding voters for decades. That is why they made a deal with the devil (religious right wing fanatics) and put their thumb on the scales with voting laws and gerrymandering. Their death throes have gone on way too long and have gotten more and more violent.
"As long as poor white Americans believe it's in their interest to keep the status quo, the Republican party will always exist."

The fact is Conservatism is having a rebirth internationally.

I don’t know if the GOP will survive. Probably not, but it’ll transform into something a libertarian would like and I imagine the 2 party system will remain. 

Which is probably a good thing. One party countries do very poorly."
My spouse and I had this exact same conversation the night before elections in 2016. Yet here we are.
"I think you are right on a long enough time scale but my main concern is the damage they do on the way out.  They know all this as well which is why they are accelerating things so fast, it's why the lich turtle had a lifelong (successful) obsession with stacking the courts...

It's going to get worse before it gets better, hopefully it doesn't break first."
"They'll survive but as a completely different entity if they keep losing elections but their worst case is losing for a few generations and hold on in deep red states. They may get to keep the House but the Senate and White House will rely on Democrats screwing up. 

It's going to be difficult to get Gen Z and younger Millennials on board so their next try will be to go for Gen Alpha and beyond while holding on to as many Gen Xers as they can."

>BERLIN. Dec 20.—Adolph Hitler, once the demigod of the reactionary extremists, was released on parole from imprisonment at Fortress Landsberg, Bavaria, today and immediately left in an auto for Munich. He looked a much sadder and wiser man today than last Spring when he, with Ludendorff and other radical extremists, appeared before a Munich court charged with conspiracy to overthrow the Goverment.

>His behavior during imprisonment convinced the authorities that, like his political organization, known as the Völkischer, was no longer to be feared. It is believed he will retire to private life and return to Austria, the country of his birth.

"If you believe in the ""Idiocracy"" theory, non-college-educated people are reproducing faster. (As are religious people too, most likely.) So if that theory holds true then Republicans could be outnumbering Democrats in the coming generations.

Think about this: the Republicans have won only 1 in the last 7 popular votes for president. That trend isn't changing anytime soon. Do you want to know how much the Republican party has changed since then? Just compare the CPAC from the Reagan era to today's CPAC. It is a stark difference.

The bad Christians are loud and the good ones tend to be quiet about it and don't make a big public show of how much of a ""good christian"" they are etc.  This is creating a guilty by association scenario and as the bad ones get worse and louder about it, it will keep chasing others away since in many peoples mind Christianity will be associated with the bad ones more and more as time goes on and they get more extreme."
I understand it though. I’m a believing Christian and I’m starting to resent Christianity because it is being used as a cudgel to hurt people.
Great example of the lack of compelling arguments that come from the Republican party.
"Or that the zealous religious sector is nothing more than a loud minority. Ironically they’re part of the reason organized religion is on the decline.

A loud and oppressive sector owns and defines the Republican Party now, and all for the worse."
They aren't doomed. That was just rhetoric. There will always be an opposing party. But I do think that they will lose power for a generation. It has happened before.
"The side with the control of the military? There are liberal gun owners too, they just usually don’t make it a major portion of their identity."
The police and army have all the guns. And they are largely Republican.
A true believer of Jesus doesn't get swayed by the opinions of the world
I think it would be a mistake to underestimate their power though. Look at all the laws they've managed to get passed already and all the freedoms they have managed to get taken away.
Personally I don’t believe they will. Especially in this upcoming election
A true Christian doesn’t go round judging others’ faith either.
"You’re not wrong, but the dynamics can change. I think they’re getting too radical and that can and will have consequences."
"I think it'll be something that happens slowly. Demographic change doesn't happen overnight. I can promise you this, however. Once the religious right becomes a minority within their own party, there will be chaos. It's going to happen. It hasn't been in issue in the Democratic party because Democrats are generally more tolerant of different beliefs. Republicans are not."
"I said that because you said you were close to leaving Christianity.  No judgment from me, only God can judge so do as you wish"
"They are definitely getting too radical, the consequences will be a fascist government. Were already seeing fascism in Texas, Florida and other states."
Honestly I vote republican despite being a reasonable and accepting human being and god forbid anyone on the other side of the political isle (at least on reddit) hear that. I doubt much will really be changing in a very very long time. I don’t really believe the democrats will win in this upcoming election either but that’s all just opinion.
I'm not at all close to leaving Christianity. And you can't slither out of what you said by saying it's God judging.
"Personally, no, I would say it's not an actual issue. There aren't even any examples, just perceived injustices.
If you're constantly looking out for racism everywhere you turn, you'll find it.  Racists are everywhere...
But fuck them! Live your life, be a fan of whatever you want to be a fan of, be a good friend, visit your mom, life's too short!"
"Ok then pay back all of the times you cancelled your debt via bankruptcy, you stooge."
Fuck this guy. And everyone that got PPP “loans” (in giant quotation marks) that are also campaigning against student loan relief.
"Debt is canceled all the time, what a clown."
"Lol fuck this dimwit. Unlawful student loan forgiveness? Yeah for them, as they have spent generations building up this entire fucking institution that robs people and impoverishes them for life, after they spent their first 20 years of life being told they had to go to college, fucking trying to figure out what college they were going to when they were 12, then prepping their entire academic career to get to that school. Meanwhile these shlups were propping up this systemic academic cost inflation.    
The student loan crisis is fucking by design. And these fucks are getting paid to help enforce this bullshit by the very industry they are supposed to be trying to protect us from.   
    
Fuck them.      
Fuck em all.     
The masses are already really fucking pissed off. What do they think is really gonna happen when we say enough is enough?      
Eat the rich, add salt and pepper as needed."
Forgiveness for me not for thee
"It has been Zero days since my representative has been an idiot, I can't wait to move out of Utah"
"Do as I say, not as I do. A great quality in any leader."
"These politicians are making these attempts to stop student loan forgiveness die with arguments that a moment of thought will expose as emotionally driven but logically void of reason, like arguments on fairness to those who paid, like a cancer cure now is unfair to those who died before.

What’s missing is the real reason and it’s scary as fuck.

The moment student debt became non-dischargeable debt in a bankruptcy, it magically went from “risk investing in no collateral borrowers on the basis of their future earnings” to “super safe, investment grade debt”.

This magically meant I could bundle student loans into AAA+ rated debt instruments and use them as “safe as treasury bonds” collateral for riskier investments, like options or short positions.

People start thinking about maybe removing that discharge provision and all of a sudden the entire financial sector gets a margin call as the certainty on student debt disappears.

The stupid part here isn’t debt forgiveness, that makes a ton of economic sense. The stupid part was ever considering student debt to be “risk less”"
"Yikes, for real! He’s going to be humiliated in the hearing. Oh well."
"The sheer hypocrisy of these people.  
""For me, but not for thee"""
Party of Hypocrisy showing why again
The hypocrisy and outright stupidity of this political party is truly staggering.
We found tens of billions in about 24 hours for a couple of well connected banking executives…
Let us remind those with oppressive debt who their oppressors are.
Another Utah embarrassment.
Unbelievable
"Talk about choosing the wrong hill to die on. The forgiveness program is VERY popular and everyone personally knows some kid who will start his or her adult career saddled with less debt if the program survives.

They say it doesn’t help everyone, just like public schools “don’t help” adults without kids. Well, they’ve always missed the point there, too. A more educated population helps strengthen society WRT existing and emerging problems."
"Well it can’t, unless you declare bankruptcy"
"Yup. Well the psycho conservatives and maga ducks, with desantis leading the way, with forbid anything to do with art, education, or handling emotions. They want the people to stay dumb so they keep the same stupid fucking interests and are without critical thinking skills. This shit is going to keep spreading."
"Florida is set to have at least 1 generation of very ignorant, uneducated children.  Good luck unlearning everything Florida wants to teach them if they make it to college.  That will be a wake up call for a lot of them."
"In the Bible Belt, classical sculpture is upsetting but somehow child beauty pageants aren't."
"Panties for dogs, next"
Yup and they’re coming to town near you when Florida drowns in the ocean.
Red shirt day? Republicans' favorite color? The Republican straights are all going to have HEART ATTACKS! Starting with DeSantis! 🤣🤣🤣
I mean it's a smart move they already are in DeSantis cross hairs so why not.
Ronnie must be shitting his britches.
"I feel like DeSantis is really overplaying his hand on the culture war stuff. It’s obvious that he sees himself as the pretender to the MAGA throne and wants to be POTUS. However, given the falling out with Trump, he can’t really lock that base in. And instead of doing the sensible things that might peel moderates away from Joe Biden in 2024, he’s just doing all the stuff gay drives them away."
This is the way.
Its a gay world after all!
That’ll show him!
So incredibly important
More revenue = paying more taxes?
"Red shirt day is 1st Sat in June at Magic Kingdom as part of Gay Days at Disney (the whole 1st weekend of June).   Now there is September as well and Orlando celebrates Pride in October each year.  As a Gay man in Florida, my dance card is getting pretty full. 😂🌈"
"Liberal tears have been the sole motivator for so much conservative self-defeating legislation - - it's time to make conservative tears become a prize that goes hand in hand with progressive legislation that treats humans with equal respect, pay, opportunity and dignity.  Tears with a purpose!  

While liberals don't behave with cruelty as the point - as conservatives do on a constant basis - it can be productive to let conservative objection become music to the ears of those seeking truth, justice, and a true American way."
And he’s pissing off Trump as well. It’s just brilliant how bad DeSantis is going to do nationally.
This is the way.
Fuck yeah. Keep your dance cars booked man!!! FUCK DESANTIS!
"I am working to dredge up some sympathy.... Working, working... working. Nope, nada, zilch, nothing."

Dare we hope rats leaving the sinking ship?
Imagine working at that vile place. What kind of person signs up to lie to people for a living?
The majority of America watching the right wing uncivil war 🍿
"Specifically, the sexist chickens have come home to roost.  Let's hope the loud, obnoxious, soulless hiring policies have bred some perfectly placed warrior women in the center of their den of crooks - and that they won't go down without clawing all their compatriots down with them."
I misread it as “the f*ckers at faux news have started to turn.”  I thought they were finally rotting like the decrepit vermin they are.
Cam someone summarize why?
welp had to figure it would happen eventually.
Let them fight.
Bunch of resumes being sent to OAN today.  Lmao
Just rats doing what rats do when they realize the ship is sinking...
"It's okay. You tried.

I want these rats to drown on the ship as it goes down.
"Nowadays, too many people!"
"Salesman, come on."
I got you fam. There is a great summary [here](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/a43375974/abby-grossberg-fox-news/?utm_medium=social-media&utm_source=facebook&utm_campaign=socialflowFBESQ&fbclid=IwAR3U-ghgIYFbjCeiktFwLQsK_o4a_pJoFtYsetH6suG1FmPADK0N39mmC7Q)
Which is more than they deserve.
I want them to eat each other on the way down.
"With Salespeople you can at least know that you're being sold something which comes with the expectation and understanding that the salesperson is putting the best face on things so they can provide for their family. You know you're dealing with a salesperson and know to be on guard. 

With FOX you have just a den of lying vipers claiming to be something they are not. Most Salespeople can say they make an honest living and I agree with them for the most part. No one employed at FOX can make that claim. They are charlatans and con-artists."

"""I have the worst client""

-Trump Attorneys"
This keeps being said. It's as if they want to reiterate something...
Never mind.  I actually read the story instead of doing something I hate and just reading the headline.   My apologies.
He thought the attorneys would take the rap as usual. Now they get to turn on him. Delicious. Live by the sword...
"How else can you do putin,xi, and the saudis bidding?"
Good. I'm glad you read the story instead of letting the headlines convince you of something that may or may not be true.
"I think it is great.

They can see what has happened to his other sycophants.

So?

Line them up and let them speak.

I assume they want to keep their license intact?

However, you never know what the bar will say or do.

I think more of his attorneys should face discipline, maybe disbarment?

Why aren't they?

Things that make you go hmmmm."
"Depending upon the news source, the story could convince you of something that may or may not be true."
"And they still support him, lie for him and make excuses for him, Trump will burn the party down."
No one forced these dipshit Republicans to hop on board the Bigot Express. They did this to themselves.
I think he's already done that.
"
Yes.

And they are not going to give up grasping his shirt-tail or kissing his hand! And his you know what...

They are supposed to be all about family.

And they bow down to a man who was unfaithful to all of his wives.

On top of everything that disgraced one term former President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice)__  has voisted on the USA?

It's quite clear that no __one human being__ (or their enablers, minions, sycophants and lackeys) should think they have this much power."
Thanks will watch it on demand later today
🤮
I’m really not opposed to a national divorce from folks who think America should be like this.
“Pleading the blood” is right wing magic spells.  They think that if they say the magic words then sky daddy will do whatever they want for them.
"1A says she's welcome to her opinion, to voice it, and even to propose legislation influenced by it, as anathema as I personally find it. Her voters elected her and others like her into a position of influence, it's up to the rest of the electorate to counteract these voices. Counteract harder. Personally, I've tossed around moving to her district just to run, or at least vote, against her."
Tired of these freaks
Bimboebert is not someone anyone should pay any attention to whatsoever.
This harpie is still wailing about imaginary BS ?
What does pleading blood even mean?
She needs to save the supernatural mumbo-jumbo for when she's not on the job.
"""The Bible tells us to declare a thing and it shall be established""

Is that just their way of saying they can make up whatever they want? How convenient."
I think you can take the idea down to the state level. South Floridians provide the bulk of state tax revenue which is propping up the poorer North Florida counties. Maybe South Florida should become the 51st state and let the poorer counties up north fend for themselves and free us from the red neck MAGA tyranny coming out of Tallahassee!
Trashley Madison
Tallahassee itself is blue and would be pissed though.
"Like with any divorce.  Some people are going to have to move.  I’m in Orlando and if I’m not going to be in “south FL 51st state”, then I will move.  If this divorce doesn’t happen, I’m gonna have to move soon enough anyway as a gay guy in FL."
"Once again, another shooting in Texas"
The mountain of bodies will never be high enough for some people to turn on the gun lobby.
"At least we know it didn't break any laws, b/c Texas.  The shooter will probably get a trophy."
If only we could provide some sort of treatment to people who start to think that killing is a reasonable solution to their problems.
Texas
Gosh if only there was a way to stop this sort of thing from happening
Texas. Brought to you by the letter R
"Damn, I watch king of the hill all the time. I would not expect this kind of behavior from the town that inspired the shows community.  Dang, Texas. Y'all are losing your way. Breaks my heart."
I guess their politicians are hoping that if it happens often and long enough people will just get used to it.
We stopped giving trophies for such low body counts. There is a mandatory minimum of 7 wounded or 4 dead for your trophy now.
Everyone should walk around with toilet paper stuck on their shoe. Then stand on the balcony and dramatically remove your N95 mask like Mussolini...also skin tan deep fake orange.
As someone who lives in trump country… I’m taking down my pride flag and making sure the shotgun is cleaned.

"This is just another way for Trump to send out more grifter emails to his MAGA base. Maybe he’ll be selling a commemorative red MAGA hat with a Stormy Daniel’s booby pin and a greenback pin. All for the low low price of $500, tax not included."
"Popcorn. Lots and lots and lots of popcorn. (You may need some extra just for throwing.) Ideally I'd have some cheddar stuff (unnaturally orange) to shake over the bowl, but the price on that stuff has gone through the roof, so probably not. (Thanks Obama. Also I hear it might rain, that's on you, too, bro.^(/s))"
I was planning on eating a shitty taco salad and shouting I LOVE THE MEXICANS. But every region has its own customs.
I have downloaded the entire Stormy Daniel's catalog.  Having a movie marathon.
Is it too late to book Four Seasons Total Landscaping for my indictment party?
"I'm going to work then straight home, these fuckers are scary."
Why hamberders and covfefe of course...but If you're one of the elite you get the maga upgrade of well done steak with ketchup and a coke!
The champagne is already in the refrigerator....
Maybe drink a bottle of water with two hands
Someone suggested overcooked steak...cold hambergers and cold fries
"My shopping list: Cheetos, Oranges, Goldfish Crackers, Aged Cheddar Cheese, Tang orange drink mix, sautéed mushrooms (you know why), McDonalds hamberders, mini bottles of ketchup for throwing throughout the day, a week-old taco bowl salad and diet cokes which I will hold with two hands as I lovingly slurp them into my celebratory gullet"
"I like the Cheetos idea. Maybe Cheetos should be given as gifts. And how about a ""wearing of the orange"" tradition? It could serve to recall our society's fascist near miss as well as symbolize what Drumpf should be made to wear for the rest of his life. And we could all imbibe cannabis, just because."
I have a seat reserved at a local bar for the post-indictment party.
The answer is alcohol. It can be drunk to celebrate or soothe wounds if it doesn't happen.

"If he gets arrested, I'll blast something that rednecks hate."
I’m putting up an American flag.
I think it's a great idea to buy out store shelves of Cheetos in support of prosecuting Trump.
I’ve been living in China for almost a year and I’ve refrained from McDonald’s since I got here.  When it happens I’m getting a hamberder
"I'm in West Los Angeles.

If Trump's indicted, the whole west side is probably gonna take a collective bong hit and get back to our organic food and watching the rain.  Maybe *some* fire works (not that they ever really stopped since the pandemic started)?

I was thinking of maybe getting some Salt & Straw as a nod to Ice Cream Joe.  Or maybe I can con my wife into going and getting some Insomnia cookies for us.

I'll probably wear my ""Just Say Nyet to Moscow Mitch"" (KY Democrats) t-shirt."

I take mine back.
Can I get a trading card?
No. We eat the popcorn and throw ketchup.
But what are you going to do after those 90 seconds have come and gone?
Chilled…classy!
">Someone suggested overcooked steak

With ketchup!"
*hamberders
Donny was the dry run. The stooge to test the system and the American people. DeSantis Is the actual fascist we need to truly worry about.
I love that video.  It never gets old.
Sound on
And that little dance that he does with his fists that look like T-Rex?  Yes!
I love this recipe!
Been eating that for so many years now.  I’m tired of ordering it!
Trump claims to have heard he'll be arrested on Tuesday in NYC for Stormy Daniels lies...fingerprints...handcuffs...dna test...could be a nice event
"Tuesday, time TBD. Even Trump has confirmed."
Trump already jinxed it by saying it was going to happen.  Remember Infrastructure Week?
There ya go...I was thinking about borrowing a fire truck to drive around with siren blasting
"Nah, get some bottled water and hit a baby with it."
Of course
Maybe some upside down bibles
The lean…
"But in Florida, they have a law to arrest protestors."
"I'm torn. For one, I'm lukewarm on ketchup. (I'm convinced fries, much like popcorn, exist to increase my salt intake.) Of course I wouldn't have to eat it in this scenario, but I'd be the person scraping it off the walls, and to top things off, I'm pretty sure the color clashes with my decor..."
"From Trump Steaks?   Do they even still have those or did that go bankrupt as well, it’s hard to keep up."
"I’m in FL and can concurs.  Ron is a real threat, but doesn’t have the people…yet."
Imagine there are some who've never gotten to see it...
Surprised you still have to place an order. Mine is on auto-ship along with the dog food.
Worse. I order something completely different & still get this every time.
But he’s a big fat liar
Some think it may not be Tuesday...that this is Trumpian BS
"Maybe, but he’s probably just trying to drum up violence and outrage from his base"
Your hands might be too big for that.

Get some cheap ketchup to throw around
Now I have to get a Bible!  (Never thought I would type those words).

My family is going crazy about this. It's unbelievable the lengths people will go to defend this man. I tried to make reasonable objections to some of their opinions and they weren't having any of it. Tuesday will be very interesting indeed.
I hear they plan the arrest to coincide with JFK’s return to Dealey Plaza
I think I will stay away from any potential protest areas. I don’t need that stress in my life
"Funny thing is, there's only Lying Trump's word that this is going down on Tues. If no arrest that day, he'll claim victory and say feds were afraid of Maga.

Hi folks. What did I miss?
"Remember: if you see someone protesting today, it's important to make jokes about how they must not have a job because they're out protesting on a weekday. The fact that you don't know anything about their personal or professional lives shouldn't stop you from standing in judgement of them. The only possible explanation for why they're out protesting today is that they're either too lazy or dumb to find work."
Why do they think things like this matter?
"Ditto. I expect stupid to present itself anywhere, though."
I hope he's arrested in Georgia instead as the new York indictment was just a ruse to get him there and to make him look stupid for lying about it being a Tuesday in new york

But, it's NOTHING like killing a baby.  Thinking that it was, I was barely on the pro-choice side of the issue.  Now, I have no sympathy for the pro-life position.  And FUCK the SCOTUS for totally ignoring the 50 years of precedence of nation-wide legal abortion.


This is what all that conservative hate mongering has led us to.  I'm not saying liberals don't hate them back, but it's pretty much policy for the right."

"That was my thought.  I believe they also resisted other restrictive laws that the nation embraced.

Just like the nation can no longer claim to have a history of non-violent transfers of power, Wyoming can't claim to be a haven for people's rights."
I guess they see that as a mistake
"Funny, calling for the women of Wyoming to revolt. Wyoming was the first state to give women the vote. That's pretty damn progressive. Believe me, the women I've met while living in Wyoming don't take shit from anyone. If they want to let this stand or not, they will let their voices be heard."

"Yes. They don't have the legal firepower available to them that Fox does. Even with all that money though, these cases *should be* open and shut.

“May” is doing a lot of heavy lifting here.

>*Subpoenas start flying in Trump’s Mar-a-Lago documents case: Dozens of staffers at former President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate have reportedly received subpoenas, as part of the Special Counsel’s investigation into the president’s document practices. Former President Donald Trump is reportedly looking at the strong possibility of being indicted by the Manhattan District Attorney’s office, in connection with the alleged hush money payments to Stormy Daniels.*

The snowball of criminal activity and abhorrent behavior is running down hill, gaining momentum and debris along the way. 

Far surpassing anything any one of us could ever have imagined.

>*It’s just one of four investigations currently encircling the former president.*
It's about time.

>*If he is indicted, Trump would be the first former president, and also the first major active presidential candidate, to face criminal charges.*

Pugnacious want-to-be dictator and defeated one term (disgraced) former President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice)__ incited an insurrection, tried to destroy our democracy and our US Constitution. He has made it clear that his intentions to continue with this mindset are still at the top of his mind.

We need to make sure he never gets near the oval office again."
"""A big price."" By his standards, or by the standards of the little people?"
I want to see it actually happen. I’m so frustrated.
He won’t. Sick of these clickbait headlines. No consequences.
“May”. I’m so sick of this.
"Quoting Kenan Thompson from that SNL sketch. 

“Ain’t nothin’ gone happen”"
Why blame the media for a justice system which functions in a completely separate manner for the millionaire/billionaire class vs the commoner?
"The entire justice system is on trial here. If it cannot nail tRUmp for SOMETHING, then it's the legal system that has failed. Law schools have produced a whole wave of legal con-artists who just work the system for the wealthy, & equate a bonanza fee with justice. THAT isn't justice. That's a bought resolution & not a solution."
Uh what? The media is just reporting on what’s happening. This is what’s happening. I don’t understand the media hate.
And he’s never gonna see the inside of a police car nor a court
"""WE GOT HIM THIS TIME!"""
Yep!! I’ll believe it when i see it
">""He is guilty of everything....""

Literally everything?"
"Not saying that the media is the root cause, and I think we've learned more than ever just how much the justice system is skewed towards favoring the wealthy. I'm just saying that the barrage of articles (This time we've got him!) are like teasing the dog by acting like you're going to throw the ball, but then you don't. The raid for his stolen classified documents was actual news. Puff pieces for all us liberals (and honestly some conservatives) to pile on ""hope"" for justice is not."
"Over the past 6+ years, isn't that really the biggest takeaway?  If there was any doubt, even a shred, that justice was ever applied equally to everyone, that notion has been smashed into small bits, chopped up, lit on fire, and put out with piss.

No, we won't ever see Trump behind bars, not because he's not guilty, but because what he's done is too close to what other political leaders have done (before and since) and they don't want to set a precedent."
Because the media is the one that keeps harassing us with this nonsense. I don't want to hear about this shit. It's never led to anything and it never will. They've been beating a dead horse from the very beginning. And it's obnoxious and they are the ones at fault. Sure the justice system is also a problem but that's not what they're even reporting on.
"Then the legal system has failed.

Trump has spent his life bribing and intimidating lawyers and judges.

He's got virtually everyone, from Merrick Garland down, scared shitless of him."
Yep.everything.
"Sounds serious.  I'm certain the walls are closing in and they're going to get him this time.  He'll do serious time.

"Poor Mikey. How does he even stand without a spine? Well, he's earned whatever he gets from his spinelessness. Climbing in bed with Donald Trump will forever haunt him."
This is why Trump will be the nominee again. The Republicans are play a game where they are trying not to lose and Trump is playing to win.
I wish trump would just go away. We need to move beyond him. Get him out of the news cycle.
"Former VP Pence does not seem to be interested in doing anything to help convict disgraced one term former President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice)__

He does not want to testify. Yet? He certainly wrote about it in his book.

So? He won't say or do anything?

>*Mike Pence won't pressure Donald Trump to drop out of the 2024 presidential race if he is charged. Pence signaled he'd back off on Thursday, saying ""everybody can make their own decisions.""*

The narcissistic sociopath, __unhinged insurrectionist,__ and grifter (with a pronounced case of logorrhea) known as one term twice impeached disgraced former President Trump has a pattern of explaining, excusing, deflecting and blaming others for the circumstances he finds himself in.

He actually gets people to do his dirty work for him.

>*Trump's GOP rivals would be in a tough position if the former president is charged.*

I think the Stormy Daniel case would be an easy case to pursue.

>*A Manhattan grand jury is deliberating if Trump should be charged over hush money payments he and his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, made to adult film star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. Daniels alleges she and Trump had an affair before he ran for president. Cohen has said the $130,000 payment to Daniels was an effort to block her from speaking out about it during Trump's campaign.*

I hate that anyone has to spend a single breath talking about twice impeached disgraced former President Trump. There are so many things that are hurting our communities, and there are so many beautifully esquisite things to celebrate. 

His negativity sucks up all of the oxygen wherever he goes.

>*Pence's early response suggests that despite the obvious rupture in his relationship with the former president, he will continue to pick and choose his fights. The strategy is also emblematic of the reality that any nominee that wants to usurp Trump will eventually have to woo away some of the former president's base.*

Why does no one have the balls to prosecute this guy? I just don’t understand it.

"Winning the GOP nomination and winning a general election are starting to become mutually exclusive goals. In the past people always pivoted their positions from the primary when they got to the general election, but now they're all about maximizing base GOP voter turnout. If they try to pivot to attract independent voters then they risk losing their base vote, so they have mostly abandoned that approach and switched over to red meat for the base 24/7. I don't think that the GOP is able to continue winning with that strategy at a national level for much longer if they're not already past that point now."
"He needs to be held accountable first, as publicly as possible."
Because he is a former president. If there is the slightest bit of doubt and he gets off on a technicality or someone didn't do enough homework than he walks and will never face punishment
Do not disagree with anything you wrote. The concern is during the general sometimes the unexpected and unlikely happens.
"I don’t know. It’s 50/50 for me. His ardent supporters don’t believe in facts anyway and so if he is arrested and then found guilty…it’s a conspiracy. If he isn’t found guilty, he is 100% innocent and it was a witch hunt the whole time. 

It’s a lose lose to me. The only win is for him to be out of the news cycle."
"Yeah, that's absolutely a real risk here, but in all honesty I think Trump is going to be easier to beat than a GOP nominee who doesn't have all of Trump's baggage attached.  Trump has already alienated a significant number of people even in his own party.  We know that the GOP die-hard Trumpers are going to give him the nomination, but there aren't enough of them to do much more than that (and their attrition is still much faster than they seem to realize - the median age of a Fox News viewer is 67 or higher)."
I'm actuality surprised that they all don't pull this crap seeing there is no more consequences for the actions of elected officials .
Absolutely.  Especially when they are being investigated by their own kind.
And the investigation leads to getting pats on the back from the investigators who then also take notes for next time so they don’t get caught.
"There are a lot of factors. One of the main factors is zoning at the local level. People don't want to live near ""poor"" people so the push single family housing zoning so apartments and other affordable housing can't get built.

I see housing near smelly factories doubling and tripling the asking rent. Almost as if they want to keep it vacant,because there are plenty of vacant houses in my city no one is going to pay that to live there. There is no shortage, but they want to act like there is.

"They didn't go under because of any ideology, to suppose SVB went tits up for that reason is ,IMO, just plain stupid.

Not because they voted a particular party."

"Why would it be bad for a bank to donate to \*ANY\* organization?  

Well it would be a bad idea because the idea is to protect the funds of depositors, and to a lesser extent, investors.

Also- if the execs knew they were failing as they obviously did and then customers and investors found out they were misusing funds by donating to unrelated causes, it wouldn't go very well for them or their futures."

> I'd be interested in finding out who funds Claremont.

Me, too. If they’re nonprofit/501(c)4, they deserve to lose their tax exemption, big time. 

Claremont is sketchy af.

From the article: 

> The claims come from a database posted earlier this week by the Center for the American Way of Life, a project of the Claremont Institute. As Claremont put it in a Newsweek article introducing the database, “Americans deserve to know who funded the BLM riots.”

…

> Ground zero for this is the allegation that SVB had donated over $73 million to the “BLM Movement & Related Causes.” 

> That struck me as quite a lot of money for a single company, even a large and profitable one, to give to any cause or even all causes. So I tried to find out where this factoid came from **and rapidly found my way to a Trumpist think tank**. 

> Perhaps not surprisingly, it’s a complete lie.

…

> But **I scanned through each one of them and found no reference to anything remotely backing up the claim**. The closest thing I found that bore any relationship to this number was a company newsletter which discusses “reinvesting in low- and moderate-income (‘LMI’) communities” in California and Massachusetts.

…

> Yet another newsletter said that $1.2 million in the company’s charitable contributions in 2019 went to “supporting opportunities for diverse, emerging talent in innovation.” Since presumably that giving had something to do with Black people, let’s assume for the sake of conversation, as Claremont clearly does, that that’s “BLM.” Even if that’s true, **it still suggests a level of giving to anything related to diversity issues that is only a tiny fraction of the claimed $73 million number**.

> It’s hard to prove a negative. **I didn’t find anything to back up Claremont’s claim in any of the cited documents.**

…

> Then there’s Boeing’s $15.6 million to “BLM.”

> You can see the cited list of recipients here. The largest recipients include the **Seattle Children’s Hospital**, United Negro College Fund, **Chicago Urban League**, D.C. College Access Program and the Forum to Advance Minorities in Engineering, Inc. Again, you can see the full list here.

> Rather unbelievably **Claremont lists Bank of America as giving more than $18 billion to “BLM.”**

> Yes, billion.

> The cited documents appear to report **only $1.25 billion** and that appears to be almost entirely going to financing for housing and business development in minority communities. So this money **may** be targeting minority advancement, but its in the form of **loans** that BOA will get paid back for. **An apparently tiny fraction of that total (no specific numbers are cited) goes in grants to organizations like Asian Americans Advancing Justice, National Coalition for Asian Pacific American Community Development and The Leadership Conference Education Fund.**"

"Rewarding Russia with peace talks for their bad behavior is essentially giving Russia what it wants, taking more land away from the Ukrainians as a very likely condition for peace.  Chomsky preferring that Ukraine not defend themselves is a partial surrender despite the fact that they're winning.

Also there is blue-collar hatred of China for taking our low-skill factory jobs, although now cost of living in China is going up and some of those jobs are moving to poorer countries. I dunno. Russia allied itself with the Republican Party (even though they deny it, I have reasons to believe the contrary). Maybe China can ally itself with the US Democratic Party? I dunno. Maybe Xi could go on a tourist trip through the US taking photos or Biden could do the same in China? I don't want to go to war with China."

I like this explanation.

And good point about ambiguity. I notice conservatives like to try to cast everything in a binary; it's either black or white. 

But as liberals, while we might generally agree on something in broad principle, when we disagree on the nuances, or how to put something into practice, we need to recognize that there is often ambiguity. And respect other opinions that are different from our own, as long as they are liberal in intent and how they are reasoned."

Either way, I would like to see blue states working more closely together to collectively fund important programs within our states like education, technology, etc...  It feels like at this point it would be easier to just go it alone."

Is that the term we use when Florida cancels library books?
The premise that it's only the left doing this is incorrect.
"There is no such thing as “liberal cancel culture”. This label is projection of an extreme right wing politics that is attempting to roll back the clock on social progress with legislation that is anti-secular, anti-choice, anti-voter, anti-science, anti-education. Right wing politics attempts to normalize its own extremism by accusing others of doing what the right wing does itself: breed intolerance.

This assertion of a cancel culture is also a characteristic of fascism: the assertion that right wing extremism is culturally pure, righteous and powerful, yet at the same time it is paradoxicallly helpless, trodden on and victimized by the rest of society. It’s a lie."
I'd like to know exactly what OP is referring to.  Cancel culture is owned by conservatives in my opinion.
Ask the Dixie Chicks about right wing cancel culture....
"Freedom fries anyone? The hypocrites on the right invented cancel culture. Now they're trying to cancel the LGBQT community, black history, Mickey Mouse and books in schools what next?"
This assertion of liberal dominance and abuse of the mainstream is farcical. What you’re seeing is majority rule and it’s not new. Not too long ago people owned slaves. Then people collectively decided that since everybody knew it was wrong they stopped owning slaves. That’s cancel culture.
"No one's trying to stop anyone from anything that I can see. If a previously accepted point of view or behavior is now out of fashion and worthy of disavowel, the person has a choice to make. Reform the behavior or suffer a drop in popularity.  
The recent case of Scott Adams is not a case of 'cancel culture'. Mr. Adam's cracked wise on a survey derived from a 4chan meme (""It's Okay to be White"") and blew up his existing contracts. It is still TBD to know if he meant to kill his income stream or did it inadvertently.

The Right's blaming of ""cancel culture"" and ""woke"" social movements is disingenuous. I'll take woke over based on lies, misinformation and newspeak which is most passes for conservative rhetoric."
"""cancel culture"" is literally a scare word conservatives use in place of boycott because it sounds worse and whips up attention from their base. Boycotting is something that literally every political base does every three seconds like how Republicans canceled Nike because of Kaepernick"

"Screw the right.. I am talking about the cannibalism of the left such as with jk Rowling and terfs who have the mainstream American position, and probably the mainstream liberal position, yet are canceled."
"I’m not talking about conservatives.. 

I am talking about the left canabalizing itself over things that are the mainstream opinion.. often of the left too… such as with jk Rowling and terfs… a conservative saying nonsense enough to get cancelled won’t hurt the left. 


Canceling liberals for not holding fringe positions will."
"Jk Rowling and the terf stuff would be a prime example of a whole group being cancelled for having the mainstream opinion, for sure concerning the average American, but I would bet my paycheck it is the average liberal position as well..

Supporting calling a trans person whatever name and pronoun they identify with and using the bathroom they identify with as long as they are medically transitioning. 

While opposing trans women in women’s sports, medically transitioning kids and playing the whole “they are 100% real women and deserve to be allowed in all women’s spaces , even if they have no plans to actually transition.”



I would bet my paycheck that is pretty much where 75-80% of Americans are at."
What about when it is for holding the mainstream American position??
"Lol are you kidding? The right doesn't want to silence libs?? One example, banning books. Your platforms? Fox News?"
Well there was 2003 when the Dixie Chicks were basically canceled by the right overnight for daring to disagree with the Iraq War. Going to the point of people sending them death threats for not just being quiet
"These are things that exist more in the conservative's impression of the left, than in the left itself. I have never, ever discussed JK Rowling with anyone. I don't care about that bs. Know what we do talk about? Health care. Food prices. Creeping fascism."
"JK Rowling is not being persecuted in any meaningful way.

She has not had her Twitter account taken away from her. She’s still writing books and selling millions. She is currently making millions off of the licensing of a brand new and beloved videogame. 

She has been VERY vocal, in quite a confrontational way, on her position on Trans folks in a way that most of her childhood fans take issue with, mainly out of concern that she is motivating trans hate crimes or oppressive legislation.

Some of them boycott her products at an individual level, and that’s their right. Some send her mean messages on Twitter. None of them have demanded she be jailed for her beliefs or prevented from writing novels. We vote with our wallets. 

You can call that “cancel culture” if you’d like, but Rowling wipes her tears every evening with hundred dollar bills. She isn’t suffering. She’s only ever doubled down on her beliefs, and everyone who disagrees with her loud, publicly-stated beliefs is allowed to loudly criticize her.

Louis CK got “cancelled” for masturbating in front of female comedians. He’s still selling out shows and distributing specials independently.

John Cleese recently ranted about how the BBC cancels people and he was probably next because of his offensive humor. These remarks were made on a BBC interview program and he continues to have a television show on their network.

Dave Chapelle got “cancelled” because of his jokes about trans people. Still selling out shows and making millions. Netflix has not removed his content.

“Cancel culture” is a political buzzword and nothing else. It is nothing more than consumers reacting to content creators and public figures in a manner they deem fit considering that public figure’s conduct.

And though some conservatives might like to claim that they engage in no such “cancel culture” behavior, they’re raging hypocrites in reality. The amount of wailing and gnashing of teeth over Rihanna wearing a revealing outfit while pregnant during the superbowl? Boycotting tv shows for featuring gay characters? Actively passing legislation to make cross dressing in front of children punishable by law? 

Crocodile tears. They can go fuck themselves."
"Jk Rowling isn't an American, and if her transphobic stance was a popular opinion how could there be large boycotts?"
"They absolutely were. It’s no different. The crux of this is that the right isn’t being denied access to the zeitgeist. They’re choosing to remove themselves from it and they’re blaming the left for not including them.

They can’t define cancel culture because it’s not really a thing. Losing a job because you were caught being a piece of shit isn’t cancel culture. It’s losing a job for being a piece of shit. If somebody wants to be a bigot then bully for them. They can’t expect to be accepted."
"That is only relevant to people for whom their entire political arena is Twitter. I do not give a flying fuck what a bunch of celebrities do or whether someone is ""cancelled."" That is not what the left is concerned with. We are busy trying to win a better life for regular people."
"so let me get this straight, you're afraid that the left will lose support because they're not supporting people who are against Trans people? or staying quiet and letting people be against Trans people?"
"ah - so you don't know diddly squat about the things on which you have strong opinions, and you project your ignorance onto 80% of the population.  I do appreciate the elaboration.  You might want to seek help if you have an actual urge to bet your paycheck so often - because you'll have to go without paychecks for a while otherwise."
Do you have an example?
"I didn’t say doesn’t want to.. I said doesn’t have control of platforms big enough to matter..

Banning books from grade school libraries is totally meaningless and a performative trap to get liberals to look like groomers.. and we are stupid enough to play along. 

A) No one uses libraries anymore lol, not even kids. Everyone has a phone and the internet. 

B) limiting information until your an adult is not the same thing as canceling adults."
20 years ago… that is a fair example though
"Republicans have latched on to those fallacies and are making sure they stay relevant with the Lia Thomas stuff, drag story hour, medically transitioning kids, exc and making sure they stay front and center, specifically because they know that is one of the only area as where public opinion is on their side. 

In most liberal Internet forums you will be flamed for showing even Luke warm  support for Rowling, hell there was a big movement to boycott a video game based on the series.. no matter how little she actually had to do with the game.. 

For sure that is not mainstream liberals.. it is a fringe thing, which is exactly my point."
"That is not true… 

In multiple different ways..

A) look up Rowling beliefs and the tweets that lead to the pushback.. the entire controversy is totally ridiculous and a witch hunt… and the same goes for anyone else considered a terf as far as I have seen.. 

They do not oppose calling people the name or pronouns they want and are against discrimination in the workplace, classroom or courtroom, but they have spoken out against the concept that just identifying as a woman with zero attempt to actually medically transition is enough to allow people in women’s shelters, prisons, locker rooms and women’s sports..

Which I guarantee you is probably a hair left of the average American, and almost certainly where the average liberal is at. 

B) mention her online in any liberal spaces it is is likely to be a flame war .. people considered TERFs are literally getting death threats and being told they are not “real feminists “ by influencers all across the left.. when I would bet my paycheck almost no one has done any research into the controversy."
"I’m not talking about the right.. I could care less about the right in most cases.. 

I am far more talking about the canibalization of the left such as with jk Rowling and terfs"
"Agreed, and yet every liberal media source and lots 
 of politicians will go to bat for “drag story hour” , kids at drag shows and other fringe issues that probably won’t help anyone, but help the right cast us as groomers… 

For sure the average democrat/liberal could care less, but they don’t get the press."
"JK Rowling and the vast majority of terfs s I understand it are not against trans people.. which is the fringe left wing claim…

The things terfs oppose are things the majority of Americans for sure but I would be the majority of liberals oppose as well… 

So yes I do not expect canceling people for having the mainstream opinion to play well nationally. Lol


TERFs oppose trans women in women’s sports, transitioning kids and the full fledged considering them 100% real women.  

They do not oppose calling people the name and pronoun they present as and such..

That is almost certainly the mainstream position."
The OP seems to be obsessed with JK Rowling and public libraries.
Jk Rowling and the anti-terf stuff.
"I work for a library and I can assure you that people of all ages are still using libraries. Also, they are banning these books from all public school libraries, not just elementary schools. Florida just banned a holocaust book... From high school libraries.


https://www.thejc.com/news/world/jodi-picoult-holocaust-novel-banned-from-school-in-inappropriate-books-row-5ciENrdr4HmK7DDw21I4ku"
"I regularly use our well-stocked library.

If there is a book that they want, but do not have, they get it for me in a couple of days.

I am quite pleased to pay the tax that funds this vital public service."
"I see, so the victims of cancel culture aren’t necessarily the targets of cancellation but those who talk about them in any way besides critically. That’s a completely separate, but I suppose fair, point.

Vocal minorities sure are vocal, I’ll give you that. Outside of the tumblrina blogosphere war zone, I can only give you anecdotally that Rowling’s products and franchise remain massively popular and profitable. Nobody in my real life has bitten my head off for buying the Hogwarts legacy videogame and my friends are pretty far left. Most people still separate art from artist, which is why people still listen to Michael Jackson songs.

But back to the point I made, the right can point to the left all day and yell “cancel culture” but it’s a massive case of pots describing kettles as black."
"That is a sad deflection, not a rebuttal"
"After I read her statements there doesn't seem to be anything so bad, so I don't think she should be canceled."
"What percentage of Americans still use libraries for books?? 

What percentage have walked into a library in the past year?? 

.0001%??

And no one is restricting books for adults. That is a massive difference from children who only have to wait or google it to have access to it..


All of that stuff is a scam to get liberals to fight for drag story hour and such so they can better cast us as groomers, and we instantly take the bait with zero tangible win,"
You could get the same book in 60 seconds on those phone…
"Oh no she has absolutely been targeted for cancellation, it just hasn’t worked.. 

You yourself are proof of that as you totally misrepresented the controversy because that is what you had heard, because it is that commonplace. 

Would the right cancel things if they had the ability?? 

ABSOLUTELY, historically 99% of all cancellations have been right wing, but not the last decade. They don’t run any relevant platform."
Am I incorrect?
"It is RIDICULOUS…. A prime example of the left shooting ourselves in the foot to virtue signal… 

Imho we became the numerical majority because we were the logic and science based group while the right were running around being creationists. 

Not because of inclusivity… not that inclusivity is bad, but some of this stuff is obviously ridiculous and for sure going to run people off."
Ours is never empty when I have been there.
"Prove it.

I don't want something on my phone.

I want a *book.*

Where is your seeming hatred for libraries coming from?"
"And canceling people rarely works. Hollywood is still putting Mel Gibson in movies despite his drunken antisemitic rant. And back to my comedian examples — you get the loud ones screaming for deplatforming and they rarely get what they want. 

Conservatives have ONE big example to point at and that’s when Twitter deplatformed Trump (temporarily) because he was a public official spreading falsehoods that were actively threatening democracy. Otherwise it’s just bloggers and commenters getting mad, but the public figures they want to cancel for speech remain largely untouched.

So conservatives might not run most of the relevant media platforms, but the liberal-run ones are mostly loathe to use the power they have to deplatform.

So ultimately you’ve got vocal minorities of two parties who wanna do a lot of shutting people down for saying stuff they find objectionable, and they’re both mostly unsuccessful."
"Absolutely… I’m not obsessed with anything. I’m a realist who doesn’t like losing over fringe nonsense by virtue signalers.

Fringe issues that make us look bad and wouldn’t even really help anyone if we were to win that issue. 

It is very easy math.. if conservatives want us to do something, it probably is not in our best interests. Duh. 

Conservatives want us to go to bat for kids at drag shows and Lia Thomas type nonsense specifically because they want to cast us as groomers, and we take the bait every single time."
ThT is not my question… what percentage of Americans use them? Just roughly?
"Conservatives doing dumb stuff is a win for the left because it chases moderates left. Just like liberals doing dumb stuff chases moderates right. 

Trump was a win for us… because he was constantly doing dumb stuff, and those who stuttered and made up ridiculous defenses also pushed moderates left..

Which is exactly what politicians and professionals stumbling and stuttering when asked “what is a woman” are doing..

That is exactly what all the “cis gender” stuff is doing , like there is any scenario where the average American swaps from saying male/female to saying “cis gender male/female… 

It shows a total lack of understanding how language works. 

A) people do not adopt something that is harder to say.. language evolves to have less syllables and things that are easier to say get adopted. 

B) the new word gets the modifier not the old word.. 

In Britain it is just the post office while in the US it is the US post office because the British post office came first.

We just have to put .com behind our web sites while people in the UK have to put .com.uk because we invented the internet.."
"So what is not ""virtue signalling?"""
There are no provable statistics.
"You’ve left the original topic entirely. This comment has some stuff I agree with and some stuff I don’t and I’m not gonna deconstruct it all, but your post was about cancel culture. Not a special interest group’s attempts to modify common use of words. 

I stand by my position that conservatives can claim “cancel culture” is a grave threat, and perhaps voters will believe them, but a) the threat they perceive has not manifested in any meaningful way, and b) its flagrantly hypocritical."
Playing to win.
That is dishonest …  you know good and well it is .000 something Americans who will step foot in a library any year…
"Which is?

That's very abstract."
"Prove it.

Making postulations with no supporting evidence is what is dishonest."
"Same thing conservatives do… highlight the issues with majority support and sneak through the fringe stuff after you win lol.. 


We do the exact opposite.. we highlight the BS half of us are not even on board with and don’t even mention the stuff where everyone agrees with us.  

But more fundamentally, imho we became the numerical majority because we were the logic and science faction while the conservatives were creationists, nor because of inclusivity. 

That said inclusivity is fine, unless it conflicts with reality logic or science. Then inclusivity loses..

If only 20% of Americans would send their children to a drag show, and going to drag shows isn’t actually helping any children. YOU DONT FIGHT TO ENSURE KIDS CAN GO TO DRAG SHOWS?!?  

Duh…"
"I cannot argue that things like that have been overdone.

I think one failing that both the left and right have is too much focus on peripheral issues, and I would call it *overcorrecting*.

I think, and I could be wrong, but I think what is going on with what I would call, for want of a better term, the cultural left, is that they have, with justification, seen how much people of colour, LGBTQ+, etc *have* been beaten down, and they want to make it right *yesterday*."
"But there is zero pushback from the left.. it is either ignored or supported, and any decent is met with shaming or bans.

TERFs are the perfect example… 


They have been shamed and excommunicated and they just have the mainstream liberal position.. they just dared to say the mainstream position out loud…"
"I'm not sure what the ""mainstream position"" is in this day and age, because things have got so convoluted.

I focus on what I focus on: universal healthcare, UBI, union/workers' rights, environmental issues, things like that.

I have a transgender friend who admits things have got too far."
I feel like there’s going to be a growing teacher shortage in the states that perpetuate the parent vs teacher nonsense. Constantly vilifying educators and education seems like a bad strategy.
"We will end up with the officially sanctioned curriculum in certain states being literally a joke among the kids themselves. Some kids will be jingoistic gung ho morons along with their parents, but most others will know perfectly well they're being duped and will be chomping at the bit to get out into the real world. Overall, I doubt the results will be what regressives are expecting."
Because they received terrible educations and they want to make sure their children don’t endure the same outcome
With bunch of dumb kids working in factories. Unfortunately.
"I’ll give you this to consider: our daughter was a HS principal.  Parent came in to talk about their kid’s failing grades.  Not believing the principal’s reasons for their child’s failing grades, the parent stood up, and took a swing at the principal across the desk separating them.  The parent was the child’s mother.  Our daughter is no longer in the public education system.  Ask around…violence against teachers, principals, and other educational staff is escalating.  It’s one reason educational staff is leaving in droves."
"I think this post begs the question....what is the point of school?

At this point, it feels like school has nothing to do with an education needed to function in the real world as an adult. Instead schools are being used as a proxy for a culture war between parents who believe they have the right to raise their children with a certain worldview versus educators who believe it's their right to raise the children with their worldview. 

I dunno if I ever knew the point of school when I was in it. Looking at it from the outside now, I see the point even less."
Depends on your end goal and theirs is ultimately privatization.
"Why not homeschool if they are so concerned about what there kids are learning? I know there is a stigma to home schooling kids but I've also heard great things too. 

The fact that a small group has a problem with how the rest of the country is willing to move forward when it comes to what's being taught is ridiculous. I would want my child to know the most up to date info so that we can be more competitive in the global market. Ppl. Choosing to keep there kids ignorant because of bigotry or religion is not my problem. How the fuck are we supposed to make America great if we don't tackle these problems head on ?"

The deranged buffoon never paid contractors who actually DID work. We’re supposed to believe he paid stormy daniels for NOT doing well… I guess it’s work?
"This is just a non stop reality show. He is so guilty, should have been tossed in prison and the key thrown away. It will never happen. Don't know about everyone else, but I stopped caring a long time ago."
After complaining that he didn't get the chance for the Georgia grand jury? (Which I don't think is an option in that state anyway)
"“But he had to pay money because there was going to be an allegation that was going to be publicly embarrassing to him, regardless of the campaign.” -Trump lawyer

Can’t make this stuff up people."
"Aside from the obvious fact that Trump can't afford to tell the truth under oath, it's rare for anyone to accept the last gasp offer (which is an indication of an impending indictment) to testify and he wasn't expected to."
"For prosperity's sake?

It would be nice to have another film with him declaring the 5th over and over and over again.

I mean, seriously, dude? And you're running for office again?

I hope and pray he never gets near the oval office again."
But only criminals plead the fifth right? 🙄
He used to say that all of the time.
McChicken.
"He wasn't subpoenaed. He was invited to appear.

Apparently that's a common practice. Prosecutors invite the person soon to be indicted to appear, in case they'd like to answer questions. An opportunity to clear your name."
Nothing. The Fifth Amendment covers you too.
"Since there's no subpoena (which literally means ""with penalty"") in this situation then nothing would happen. If there were a subpoena then you would have to answer it (or suffer the penalty for contempt), but you could plead the Fifth."
"It's rare for the subject of a GJ investigation to accept an invitation to testify--it's a stacked procedure run by the prosecutor, so there's no way you're going to dissuade the GJ from indicting you at that point.

As for why announce it, that's clear from the article: it gave Tacopina the opportunity to attack the legal system on air."
Commenting is not consistent with not caring.
"At least now there are really no voters left who don't already have an opinion on Trump. People love him or hate him. An insignificant conservative minority try to play both sides: they liked his policies and Kavanagh/Gorsuch/Coney Barrett were all under his watch, but they admit he's generally his own worst enemy and lament that his behavior is what is most scrutinized, complaining that it distracts from his purported accomplishments.

Trump's biggest challenge in 2024 will be picking up new voters. His base will vote for him no matter what, but it's also stagnant."
The 5th 400 times for the most “ transparent administration in history “ Trumps words.

Investigators and prosecutors prosecute. Its ONLY your lawyer that defends you."
"The Fifth Amendment doesn't excuse you from answering a subpoena (which means ""under penalty""), but there's no subpoena in this case (generally happens when someone about to be indicted is invited to testify) and that, not the Fifth Amendment, is why tsdguy would not have to testify."
I want him to plead the 5th a 1000 times next time he is up.
"I'm aware of the legalities involved.

Perhaps I should mark it /s.

I was being sarcastic.

Edit - Added last section about sychophants and lawyers."
"Yes.

They have followed their ruler and paid the consequences. 

I have a friend who lives in Maryland.

She and her husband have not received shots - don't believe in them. They have both experienced ""it"".

And they use hydroxychloroquine.

She talks about having a prescription and giving out the pill to friends and relatives (for various ailments, even acne treatment).

I listened to her. I have not seen her in more than 24 years (opposite sides of the country). She is prescious to me (and well loved). I could not believe my ears.

(1) taking horse medicine - she points out dosage is for human consumption (2) sharing prescriptions with friends and relatives (3) ignoring scientific facts (4) finding a physcian to write the prescription (5) trying to foist it on me (6) incredulous that I have received five shots, eligible for my sixth. (7) Let's me know I need to do the right thing and what that means is different for both of us, I'm sure.

Where has my friend *disappeared* to?

It's like listening to someone babble on about disgraced one term former President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice).__

No substantive evidence that he did anything good or ever would, and gobbledygook galore emanating from all pores.

"And they’re dying. Literally dying. Old age, COVID complications, heart disease…"
"In one of Trump’s latest tweets he says he is the all time favorite President.

He’s absolutely pathological. Irredeemable. And destined to go down in time as the most obvious criminal who ever became President."
"Thanks. I had misunderstood. And of course he could plead the 5th if he did show. 

Again however why not issue the subpoena?"
"The ones who are spreading Covid before dying of it are taking with them some people who don't share their beliefs, though."
"I was one of those idiots who thought his criminality was so transparent he couldn't possibly even win the GOP nomination.

"It's honest projection.  These men think ""well everyone WANTS to fuck kids, that's why we have religion and laws telling us not to.""
   
And they view accepting different rules and values as openly accepting what should be shoved down.  If you don't adhere to Christina values, of course you're gonna groom kids!  Anyone would, if they could without going to hell!  Jesus is the only thing between us and chaos.

"To avoid the ClickBait title link, here's the answer for everyone:   


Carlson hates Trump, and the majority of FOX dislikes the republican party, but still does the $#!7 they do because it brings them in money. 

That said, there was one good line in the ""article"" that was parroting what we've all saw from other news sources already: 

Oliver gave a mock-news bit of if Fox News were to report on the Assassination of John F. Kennedy today...

“The president had a lovely car ride in Dallas today,” Oliver said. “His head feels better than ever.”"
They don’t care. It is theater. They will keep feeding poisoned pablum to the cult and absorb the costs

"Whoa buddy. I can't speak for churches and mosques but the vast majority of synagogues in the US are Reform or Conservative congregations that range from  egalitarian to expressly feminist and LGBTQ+ accepting.

I grew up with the first female Rabbi ordained and female rabbis are everywhere now. 

The Orthodox on the other hand, have some pretty strict ideologies about gender roles but some of them are still somewhat progressive.

So maybe not all religious institutions are a monolith, ya know?"
"There are multiple reasons.  In RICO-style cases, the best approach is to indict and convict the lower-level people establish a basis of criminality and hopefully flip a few against the crime boss.  Those people were the round one people.

Second, mob bosses like Trump know how to put a layer of plausible deniability between themselves and the people who can be thrown under the bus.  Most crime in this realm have to show knowledge and intent.  That is more difficult to prove.  


Third, Trump is politically high-profile.  The cult of the Republican base - noteworthy for their top-notch cognitive dissonance skills - and their Republican enablers will make prosecution inherently political.  Their case *must* be very solid.  Anyone going after a high-profile Republican should expect reprisals from the increasingly authoritarian Republican Party.  


Any reasonably complex case takes time, even if it appears to be a ""slam dunk"" on the surface.

Trump has convinced 40% of USA they can’t even believe the news!  The crazy thing is Trump himself is an babbling idiot."
"To answer your question: Stone, Manafort, and Cohen have all had their day in court, Trump hasn't.  
  
The reason Trump hasn't been to court (yet) is because no prosecutor wants to take a case against a former President unless it's a slam dunk, guaranteed conviction.  You can't try a person for the same crime twice, so if Trump is brought to court and his defense *wins,* that's it, we can't try him again on that charge.  
  
Donald Trump won't be punished until he gets a trial, and he won't get a trial until (or unless) prosecutors are certain that they can prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that he's guilty of committing a crime."
"Money, lawyers and a corrupt system where it's not just probable Trump did something wrong, you have to prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt, and even then he can appeal and appeal and appeal until he finds a judge he hired to rule in his favor, tying the court system up for years and playing a game of attrition with limited resources and time on the prosecutor's side. If you're wealthy enough in the US, you have immunity."
'Only the best people'
"Buffers. Yeah, the family's got a lot of buffers."
It’s white Republican presidential privilege.
That's how organized crime works.
"The man—over the course of his life—has managed to escape responsibility for his personal, political and business dealings. He’s left a long trail of bodies behind; people willing to fall on his sword for the sake of (one-way) loyalty. I have no fucking idea why. 

He’s not particularly smart, but he’s clever enough to use the legal system and a truckload of lawyers to avoid paying for services and being held responsible for every one of his failed business ventures. 

Eventually he’ll fail. Catching the small fish to reel the big one in has been used so many times in successful RICO cases, and I feel that it’s only a matter of time before an airtight case can be made against the malevolent little motherfucker."
He has been buying power and secrets for 50+ years. He has dirt on everyone from politics and business to Holywood and the world's leaders. The mob boss analogy was spot on. We're lucky he wasn't reelected.
"You come at the king, you best not miss"
Ultimately infirmity will take up residence and I will get out my popcorn.
Art of the deal ?
"Who says he is unscathed?  He is being investigated on the federal and state level.  Mara lardo was raided by FBI. They went back and found more docs after the first raid.  He has settled sooooo many law suits out of court to keep them out of the news so we never heard about many cases of him paying up. 

I get it.  he needs to go down for so much but keep in mind M Garland has a 100% conviction rate and justice moves slow but claiming trump has been ""unscathed"" is not truthful nor helpful."
He’ll never serve a single day.
Because the conservative leaning media like MSNBC & CNN won’t hold him accountable like they should.
"Learn it. Know it. Live it. 

The media lies and unfortunately trump is no bigger of a crook than the rest of them

Please down vote me and call me names all you want. It wont change the truth"
Soon come.
"Delegation. 

It’s a psychopath managerial thing."
"he still has that safe with all the dirty little secrets in it

"Cohen got in trouble for the stormy daniels thing. There were campaign finance violations I believe. They decided not to indict a sitting President, but he was just called to a deposition, which he won’t go to, and then the indictments should follow."
"because half the country thinks he is genuinely innocent and prosecuting him should be treated sensitively. 

if the country weren’t so polarized, his arrest would have occurred a long time ago."
All of this shows what you said clear as day.
"I guess, get *photos.*"
"In addition, much of law enforcement, including the FBI, are Fox-watching Trump supporters"
"Right?!?

And then he'll brush it off like he had no idea how bad they are, like Michael Flynn. De Nial ain't just a river in Egypt."
He is above the law
Have you watched Dirty Money on Netflix? Trump has been cheating and criminalizing for 50 years.
"The only difference from the Bush, Obamas, Clintons, Gores etc is his ironic yet demonstrable ability to not get us in a war. Not his ability to match a stereotypical Netflix depiction"
That dude has underage hookers written all over him
This is truly frightening. Damn
This dude looks like a demon wearing human skin
"This article is truly horrific, but worth the read."
"Let them try it.

I'm sick of ""being nice"" to this lot."
This sounds like a secret deep state organization. Every accusation is a confession.
This is exactly what the GOP wants.
Given how small a group transgender people are- it would have to be an amazing coincidence for these to have been random killings.
i would think yes - - - https://www.usccr.gov/files/pubs/docs/08-17-Wisconsin-hate-crimes.pdf
"I haven't been following these incidents so I will speak generally about what I know regarding hate crimes. 

It's not just as clear cut as the public outcry stating it's a hate crime. Each state has different laws surrounding what is considered a hate crime. Federally there are laws that were passed, but, ultimately it comes down to two things:
1. Is it a ""hate crime"" as determined by that states specific law?
2. If the state decides it isn't a hate crime, will the FBI choose to investigate/take over the case?

Using the two items above:
1. WI does not recognize gender identity as a basis for a hate crime. It only covers sexual orientation.
2. As far I can tell from very limited research, the FBI has not yet decided to do anything on these incidents. However, there may be something happening that the public isn't aware of, or that I wasn't able to find in a cursory search.

Here are three good resources for researching the basics:
[Southern Poverty Law Center Hate Crime Laws Explained ](https://www.splcenter.org/news/2022/09/07/hate-crime-laws-timeline)

[US DOJ Learn about hate crimes](https://www.justice.gov/hatecrimes/learn-about-hate-crimes)

[Hate Crimes map by state law and LGBTQ](https://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/hate_crime_laws)

Edit for spelling and to separate links."
Exactly.
"Their point, I think, was more closer to because a person kills a man, doesn't mean they were misandrist. 

So here, maybe the fact that three transgender women were killed over 9 months is more a reflection of them living in a dangerous area with high crimerates, rather than transphobia specifically."
"It’s hard to tell how big an issue it is because of how small the population pool is. 

I just read that the number of homicides towards trans gender people “doubled in 4 years” from 2017-2021. But that was a jump from 27 to 56. 

I hear people in public discourse use words like “genocide” and “holocaust,” which is at the very least misleading."
"It is important to note though that gender is not considered a factor in a hate crime. We could use those statistics to get a clearer view of this problem. If gender identity isn’t recorded in a homicide, and since there’s ultimately a low population of transgender people, it’s difficult to demonstrate with a number how bad the problem actually is."
"I used to consider Taibbi was an iconoclast, speaking truth to power. I followed him a lot during the Iraq War and all the boondoggles therein, one after another. 

But he's kind of now in the Glenn Greenwald mold where they thought tearing down toxic institutions meant they should assign equal amount of malfeasance to some on left. I'm certainly not saying there's nothing worthy of criticism on the left. There's plenty to go around. But he kind of went off the deep end."
The Twitter files are nothing burgers.
"The guy sounds like a bought off a-hole looking to sell controversy at the expense of his integrity. I think this sums it up nicely...

""At another point, Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) asked whether Taibbi had been provided records of the Trump White House asking Twitter to remove a tweet by model Chrissy Teigen, in which she called then-President Donald Trump a “pussy ass bitch.”  
Taibbi began, “No, but that’s probably because ... ”  
Connolly jumped in: “Probably because it didn’t confirm the bias that this is all about ... ‘the left’ attempting to control content when in fact the evidence is the Trump White House most certainly attempted to control content on Twitter.”"""
It’s all just another attempt for the right wing to get their base all riled up over nothing
"They guy that harangued the Biden campaign for requesting nude photos of his son be removed from Twitter as “government interference” (though, how? Biden held no position), while simultaneously not batting an eye that the actual POTUS requested and received removal of certain other posts? That guy?"
"I wouldn't say he panders to the right, but he panders to the anti-left, which the right wing loves to throw their dark money propaganda dollars behind to prop up. This way, he has plausible deniability when the left accuses him of selling out.

Some other notables who followed this path:

Tim Pool

Glen Greenwald

Bill Maher

Russel Brand

Tulsi Gabbard

&#x200B;

It's exhausting to see these people get so much undeserved attention when their grift is so transparent. It's almost becoming a parody of itself."
"""We"" generally try to avoid groupthink. I think that Taibbi loved the attention that muskrat gave him, said files are nothingburgers and Taibbi statement that he didnt believe there was government interference gets drownded out. At the hearing what we learned was that it was trump and admin censoring media, which we kind of knew already. I mean he had cell phones of Dem mocs children wiretapped and was always calling for censorship of tv shows he didnt like re SNL"
Taibbi has been a Russian Asset all along.He speaks fluent Russuan.
Lot of right-wingers trolling today huh
The reps questioning him and the other one were painfully dumb as well. Wow
How did he go off the deepend? He is just reporting on things he thinks is in the public interest. Why does it matter which political party he exposes?
Exactly. They said they had so much stuff and they didn't look at it all.
"Well no, it's not about the party it's about the action being sanctioned by the government in general. Taibbi was exposing government requested, and bought, censorship involving true facts about the covid 19 vaccines. The pandemic may have started under Trump, but he was out of office before the vaccines became public.

I am a liberal, I am for free healthcare for all, living wages, unions, you name it. But these are facts about medicine being censored at the request of the government for money*. Flat out undeniable, I don't understand why my friends and fellow peers are defending this.

If thus was done by Trump I know all my friends would agree with me.

* Because you may not know the specifics if you didn't watch the hearing, I will provide you the context of the money given to Twitter. Government offered money to Twitter for their time to censor speech. Twitter initially denied the money because they knew, ""the money is a conflict of interest"". Those are Twitter's words. Twitter eventually accepted the money knowing that it was wrong to censor stories for money. This is literally the government paying Twitter to censor TRUE information about negative vaccine information. Their goal was to minimize vaccine hesitancy, but it's TRUE information they requested to be censored."
"Matt Taibbi is a liberal journalist. I understand that Republicans wanting to throw punches at democrats, but I don't understand why Democrat politicians were treating Taibbi so awfully and why people are defending that behavior."
"I disagree. I'm not a fan of some of those people, but they do bring up a good point of how not-left the left party is in America. In some ways, the Democratic party is right of the Republican party. Pro-war in ukrain, against the railway unions, pro outsourcing jobs to other countries. The party just doesn't stand for the everyday working person. 

I hear people constantly complain about the two party system in America, but people still don't like their own party criticized. That sort of team spirit only divides the country and solidifies this system because they fail to act against a party that betrays them. I do agree with Russell Brand, Matt Taibbi, Jimmy Dore when they say we have a one party system in America."
And entirely too many people arestil comfortable blasting embarrassing private photos
Yeah but Republicans suck anyway.
Is it really not that evident from his recent writings?
"Why do you keep focusing on ""liberal"" status? It's irrelevant. The issue was that he cherry picked the stories he wanted to ""expose."" Prove that quote is objective fact."
Matt Taibbi is a “journalist” whose whole schtick is attacking democrats to empower republicans.
"Why does it matter that he's a ""liberal"" journalist?"
How would you describe the right wing position on the 3 issues you mentioned?
Yeah and then fascist Karen's whine about classic books for children while that stuff is all over social media
Because for some reason it seems like a conservative view point to support him and I'm not a conservative. I'm trying to understand why it's this way. What is he saying that makes his view non liberal?
Exactly.
"I'm not talking about right wing. I'm talking about the failed representation of the left wing in this country

And republican have been surprisingly antiwar with regards to Ukraine. Much more so than the Democrats in Congress. Unfortunately"
Consider three things: 1)this argument is completely unrelated to liberal va nom-liberal. It's not a policy discuss. 2)no one gets a free pass from scrutiny because the carry a similar political label 3)He's full of shit.
"My point is to beware of false equivalencies, which these people love to peddle in, and the right wing loves to prop up. They would have you believe there is no difference in voting R vs D when in fact, there is a lot of difference.

I can give you a long list of progressive accomplishment in the past 2 years under this administration. These accomplishments far outweigh whatever failed representation you believe is occurring, or these people would have you believe.

The right wing, or at least Trump, is happy to let Putin take over a sovereign country through violent means as part of a corridor of other countries that would lead to a lot of blood shed. To say that this position is anti-war lacks context."
"Absolutely not. To justify US involvement in this war lacks context. 

1. US backed a coup in 2014 to establish an anrirussian government.

2. East Ukraine is still pro Russian and people were prosecuted pretty hard for beinge Russian sympathizers. 

3. A sort of civil war erupted in eastern provinces of Ukrain that resulted in Ukrain bombing their own people.

4. This gave an excuse for Russia to ""defend"" those people. They started bombing antirussian areas in the region and arming civilian to revolt.

5. Russia then demanded that Ukrain let those provinces be independent, or Russia would put troops on the ground

6.Ukrain didn't want to lose the land people or natural resources of those provinces, so they continued their military intervention in the area, trying to hold onto its claims of the land.

7. Russia invades Ukraine under the guise of ""freeing prosecuted people"" and ""fighting Nazis."" There are nazi battalions in the Ukrainian army that have a history of nazi refugees from ww2. Not prevalent, but they exist, Azov Battalion is the usual example. Russia has held this position against Ukrain since the 2014 coup.

8. Ukrain enters peace talks with Russia

9. US and UK intervene in peace talks telling Zelensky they will fund him. Zelensky is also threatened by far-right extremists in his own government if he makes peace with russia.

10. US wrote blank check to Ukraine and sent equipment. Arms originally sent to Ukraine for their war somehow end up in terrorist hand in Denmark and the Congo. Ukrainian officials recently were caught taking some of this money for themselves.

Please tell me what I missed that justifies the US supporting Ukraine. Looks to me like we're a catalyst to conflict in the region. It's a continuation of the forever wars in the middle east wake up. Why do we care that Ukraine is being harrased by Russia, but nobody says a goddammit thing about the US bombing Yemen to help Saudi Arabia's Genocide."
"If you think parroting Putin’s (unfounded) claims and justifications for a clear and hostile invasion of Ukraine somehow makes other countries pro-war, then I don’t see how we’re ever going to agree. It’s probably not worth the time or effort by both parties, sorry."
"I'm not parroting ""claims."" I'm stating facts. All of that, until the last statement, is observed and proven fact. Other countries and the US ARE actively pro war. This was known and accepted before the Ukraine War. That's why we went warring on the Middle East. Russia AND America can both be in the wrong, and they both are. If you're not antiwar, you're not liberal. This conflict has killed so many people, from soldiers to civilians. It is going to leave Ukraine in absolute ruin and disrepair. For what? So Ukraine can hold on to two provinces that just wanted some autonomy."
"2020/2021 was a real mind fuck for me as a lawyer. I’ve spent my entire legal career (still ongoing) being afraid of doing anything that could even appear to be dishonest or unethical because I have always been super protective of my license/feared the Bar. Also, I generally try to just be a good human and do the right thing. 

Watching these clowns lie to courts and to the press was so confusing. I hope she gets disbarred. She is an embarrassment to women and attorneys."
"""Censured"" by the judge and fined $224. For lying in court and participating in a coup attempt."
$224 - what in the actual fuck do you need to do in this country to get actual repercussions.
Can the bar association do anything about her?
how are these people still practicing law. had a hand in trying to bring down a nation.
"""As part of the stipulation, Ellis agrees to pay $224.""  


That's laughable.  That's little enough she can point to the fine and say ""I was right""."
We are truly fucked if this serves for the consequences of attempting to overthrow the democracy
"Psh, this is the justice system's way of saying 'you'll get em next time kiddo, keep it up!'"
"She wasn't disbarred because she didn't lie in court; rather, she only lied to the public. However, what makes her an even bigger piece of crap is the fact that she did it for personal gain. To top it off, she now claims she didn't ""lie"" but simply failed her duty of candor to the public. It seems that supporters of MAGA just can't resist being deceived."
Does censoring her actually do anything? Why not just disbar her?
Can’t we shut all these trumpers up.
">. Also, I generally try to just be a good human and do the right thing. 


Well, I suppose the GOP will not be calling you for help.  You fail two of their hiring criteria."
Narrator. She did not get disbarred instead she got a partner position at a law firm
That’ll show her.  /s
Be poor
They could disbar her
Epilogue. And all the normal people who are trying to do the right thing are still struggling.
Whoa whoa whoa. She got fined hundred of dollars too!!! How much can one person be punished?
Also don’t be white
Seems like a solid plan.
But they won't
"As well as, Be uninsured and suffering from some mental health issues that you can get treated"
"Since the far right doesn’t like to remember a lot of rules, they’re doing what they can to ensure non-whites ARE poor. That way they don’t have to think too much when oppressing people"
Unfortunately his speech fell on deaf republican ears as they missed most of the speech as they were trying to figure out what Nihilism and Agnostic mean…

Hair loss due to chemo
"I thought Prison Mike was funny, but now I know he's a true badass."
Now I feel bad.  Hope he is doing well.
Steven Van Zandt sent it to him. Not kidding.
"Sweet.  The bandana, not the chemo."
We're getting just what we asked for from China.. sending manufacturing to China was irresistible to businesses and caused product's to be discontinued.. because they (continue to) rip them off and sell them cheaper..
"As the great mind said ""American politicians only care two things: what can get them elected, what can get them profits"". I think in the current political environment, it is safe to say any politician has a hard on China will get elected, or the opposite any politician that is soft on China will not get elected, whether it is R or D. Profit-wise, you have competing powers between MIC (L-M, Raytheon, Boeing) and tech and trade (Apple, Amazon, Walmart), one side will profit from war (not necessarily direct war, just increasing tension will get them profit), and the other side will profit from more trades. Currently MIC prevails so the relationship checked out."
"Co-opetition. If you are a true liberal you will automatically separate the average hard working Chinese citizen from their  authoritarian ruler. Most have no choice similar to when Trump won with a popular vote minority in the US. So, different systems, same result. From that perspective it is much better to see China in general as a competitor and partner b2b and not as an enemy."
China is run by an authoritarian regime increasingly becoming more autocratic with Xi in charge.  They have been dishonest about the spread of COVID while allowing its infected citizens to travel around the world to spread the disease into a pandemic. Any American liberal or conservative should view the current regime as hostile to our country.
"If you're a liberal, you should despise the CCP.

If you don't, you're not liberal - just whatever flavour of anti Republican."
"China is a machine. They have socially engineered obedience and work ethic through cruel and often unusual punishment. It will over take the US at some point if we do not go to war with them. Respectively, in my opinion ofc."
"No, although Trump has stated repeatedly that he admires Xi, even moreso now that he's appointed himself ruler for life."
We should not go to war with them. At some point Xi will die and changes will happen in China.
With all of the real problems facing this country and literally every one of these GOP-Led states. This is what they feel is the best use of their time.  Outlawing guys dressing in woman’s cloths and singing.
"Thank you 8 pound 9 ounce baby Jesus. Finally the politicians are doing something to protect the kids from these totally voluntary, harmless, non issues. This is time way better spent than trying to do anything about school shootings."
"I bet dollars to donuts they are only wanting to restrict kids from going to drag shows and that is something only liberals on the fringe think is a bad thing. 



This is the kinda thing that 85% of the country will not get on board with, which makes it politically suicidal…

Sometimes it seems like we are willing to lose the issues that actually matter on the alter of inclusivity…

Inclusivity is fine when it doesn’t conflict with logic, but when it does it just becomes counterproductive and even down right harmful because look who we are giving the car keys too!! 

Republicans."
"So why not a Dark Left? 

It's time for the Dark Left to rise, sack up, and appropriate the rhetoric of the alt-right to vilify the Christian nationalists, the White nationalists, and their two-faced allies and enablers.

No to reactionaries, no to robber barons, no to corruption!

Fight the Devil with fire!"
"5 min ago weren’t we saying that beauty pageants were a bad thing that objectified and over sexualized women, but now if it is guys dressed like women it is cool, in fact bring the kiddos?!!?!? 

Do we really think the average American won’t notice how crazy that is??"
It's better than working for a living
"The only part I see an issue with is that the categorization prevents performance on public property, aka the libraries where drag queen story hour might take place."
"Obviously, you never saw a drag show. Hello, it’s entertainment. If it doesn’t entertain you, don’t go. Obviously, you never saw a clip of Giuliani in drag and Trump with him. Google it. All in good fun."
One of these things is not like the other...
"There is nothing inherently sexual about a drag queen in age-appropriate clothing reading an age-appropriate book. 

We all agree that kids shouldn’t be at an adult drag show. But drag — like comedy or any other performance — can be for adults or for kids. There’s no reason it can’t be unless you’re just repulsed by the idea of a man in a dress. In which case I’d encourage you to watch Mrs. Doubtfire — a movie for kids — and get over yourself."
"Drag queen story hour is ridiculous, and I would bet my pay check less than 10% of the country agrees with it…

It blows my mind 5 min ago liberals were against beauty pageants for objectifying and over sexualizing women and a terrible example for young girls, but now drag shows are a societal good and are not sexual…

What?!?  

Lol"
"It is sexualized entertainment… the kinda thing we don’t normally allow children at. 

What percentage of Americans see their neighbor leaving the house in drag and say, “hey Steve, junior really needs to experience a drag show, any chance you might take him with you??”

That is the percentage of Americans who will support the left in that fight.. everyone else we are pushing right."
"What?!?!

So a beauty pageant is not like a drag show?!? 

So a drag show is not an cartoon version of a beauty pageant?!?!"
"Sure .. there is nothing inherently sexual about a stripper, who doesn’t take her clothes off reading a age appropriate book either.. 

You still would have outrage about that too, because the reason she is there is because she has a sexual occupation and people are specifically targeting a sexual occupation to have “stripper story hour.”

Obviously we do not all agree kids shouldn’t be at adult drag shows or “the left” would concede the point and we would move on to issues that matter where we win.."
"Well, what's ridiculous about the story hour?  That ""drag show"" isn't the same show that's put on in bars and strip clubs.  It's just a man dressed as (with exaggerated features) a woman doing the same story reading anyone else could do.  

Beauty pageants are simply not drag shows. Idk what more there is to say on that.  

I'm not saying it's a ""societal good,""  and I would push back against that claim, but as far as a performance goes, America should lean towards the freedom of expression here.  The only reason there is liberal defenses of it is because of the hyperbole by conservatives about ""grooming.""  

I was involved in a drag story hour in my city where conservative activists came from out of state to protest it outside of our library.  I think some amount of defense against that is warranted if we are to be consistent and defend expression even when we don't like it."
Under the rock people like you who never went to a show say shit like this.
"Um, not really.

Why is it I never hear you people complaining about child beauty pageants which actually sexualize kids?"
You've clearly never seen either.
"Drag is not a sexual occupation which is the clear and obvious distinction that you are missing (perhaps deliberately). Comparing it to stripping is quite literally a right wing tactic and a false equivalency. 

It’s pretty clear that you don’t know much about drag queens. Read about pageant queens. Go to a drag brunch. Watch some RuPaul. Learn about the community you’re demonizing for whatever reason."
"You mean liberals who agree with everything but the most fringe of left wing issues??

Realists who are not willing to lose and let the republicans have the car keys concerning issues that actually matter. Just so we can die on hills that are basically irrelevant??"
"I've been to a drag show, I still don't think it should be in children reading hour at the library."
People have been talking about how beauty pageants were a terrible example to set for young girls for decades too..
“Nah uh” is not a rebuttal..
"But 5 min ago beauty pageants were objectifying and over sexualizing women and a drag show is a cartoon version of a beauty pageant…. 

Suuuuurrrrreee.. 

Drag shows are in practice if not in theory sexual."
"You said it yourself, fringe issues. Gop laches on to few examples and makes a national crisis worth legislation. If some parents want to take their kids to shows for adults, thats on them. Parental rights,yeah?"
"Drag show is one thing, I have been to several, never saw a kid. Drag story hour is another. Its up to parents not government to decide where you take your kids."
"A person with a passing knowledge of drag wouldn’t make the statements you’re making, so he’s right."
"Of course they latch onto the very few issues where they or right and/or have majority support… 

Why would they latch onto issues where they lose, lol?!?

Sun tzu - attack your opponent where they are weak, not where they are strong. 


That is why it is up to us to concede the VERY FEW places where that is the case. So those are off the table. 

If we do we win for sure.."
The real question is “how many voters are you willing to trade so that kids can go to drag shows?”
"Okay I see your point. It should be a moral or ethical choice, not a legal stipulation."
"Funny how both of your rebuttals are “nah uh” without any form of a counter point… that stuff doesn’t work on ANYONE who doesn’t already agree with you, which is probably 12% of the population max…"
"Hmm, number of kids at drag shows probably less than 50. Number of small government conservatives foaming at the mouth- millions. Dumbo gop does this because they never try to solve universal problems, something that matters."
"In order to deserve a counter point, you first have to make a point. Everything you've said is based on an objectively false premise."
"Agreed… so how many moderate voters are you willing to trade so that nationally 50 kids can go to drag shows… 

Plus it plays choosing that as a hill to die on 100% plays into their groomers narrative??"
"Ye old, “I have the bestest rebuttal ever, but instead of using it and winning the point, I am just going with “nah uh”..”


Suuuuurrrreee"
"If voters think solving imaginary problems makes their lives better, they cannot be helped."
"Yes, that's exactly what you just did."
"They are smart enough to highlight the issues where they will win and sneak through the issues where they lose, and we do the opposite"
Not smart enough to stop overreacting. Must remind them Jesus wore a dress. Doesn’t make him a groomer.
"It is only stupid if it doesn’t work, and it does…

It is us being stupid if we lose over fringe issues that even if we won wouldn’t do much good anyway.. 

They don’t seem willing to die on hills most conservatives don’t even agree with, but we will… 

They highlight the issues where they win and sneak the corporate tax breaks through after they win.. while we win on 99% of issues and choose to let the fight be over some fringe issue."
"They are criminalizing  adult entertainment under save the children bulshit. Ban churches first, its been proven. They are banning books, will they start banning numerous movies where crossdress occurs…. they will never stop. I know that kind."
">The emails illustrate just how long some major figures in the anti-trans movement have been incubating political attacks on transgender healthcare.

"Yesterday I was watching shorts on YouTube.  It was flooded with pseudo-intellectual arguments, all suspiciously similar, that started about two weeks ago. I'm not on Twitter any more so I  don't know what's happening there but I wonder if that started two weeks ago, too. 

So, that would have been right before CPAC so everyone who attended was fully loaded.

"This should show people Faux is not News ( exception MAGA ) and that it’s nothing more than a propaganda show that benefits Faux ratings, nothing more. MAGA’s identity is Faux news as Faux’s identity is MAGA’s, Carlson becomes nothing if he must stay with the truth and facts, same for Faux news program. Every news outlet has a conservative or liberal leaning which is fine, but to blatantly lie and spread Disinformation to cause division for ratings is criminal IMO. It’s not entertainment or funny it’s dangerous."

If he was destroying the country but in his mind thought what he was doing was the right thing thats one thing, but when he 100% is aware hes trying to destroy the country and doing it solely to fatten his pockets that makes him a complete and total piece of trash. Theres plenty of other ways to make money, but he chooses the one that involves tricking idiots, that he thinks are idiots, into believing complete lies."

"That's what I suspected all along. The people at Fox News are not stupid, but they are paid to say what they say. This makes them worse though."
"I've been in media coming up on two decades now. I've been in radio, print media, & television.

There are a lot of talented, dedicated, passionate writers & broadcasters.

There are a **lot** more who don't give a damn about anything but the dollar, & will lie through their teeth to earn it.

YOU CAN NOT EXPOSE THESE PEOPLE. Attention is what they WANT. Every time you think you've dunked on someone, you've given them more clicks & views, & they get paid more.

The ONLY way you drive them out is to acknowledge the good ones, & block/ignore the grifters.

That's it."

That's just it. I don't think this will affect him in the least because apparently his viewers don't even know that this is going on SMH.
Does Melania really hate him? I thought she'd cut bait after the election....now I think she's just the female form of him.

They know that GOP voters simply don’t care about the truth, so they don’t care about it either."

Just part of God's plan. /S
"Good for them! I'm glad they're standing up for their health, hopefully the babies health is put in danger instead."
The abortion scam is just a scheme to fully employ all of the out of work lawyers.
How were they put in danger?
Because doctor performing abortions there risk losing their license.
Because fascist intimidation works to suppress people. The average person finds it hard to stick their neck out for others when they are worried about their own livelihood.
Because the states issue medical licenses
"I'm sure they are, but they fear loss of license if they make too much of a stink."
"Honestly, I don't have a lot of hope. Most people agree at least some level of abortion should be allowed and the ones who don't who are making these policies think good women who don't want them are dying as martyrs and hero's and the bad ones who wanted the abortion deserve to die. 

I want it to make a difference, I'm just not convinced it will."
"Start? 
You mean the grieving families sue."
"Unless it's one of their own dying, they won't care. Women dying is just a price to pay for ensuring they save the bayyyybeeees."
Only if it's a republican member that can't get out of the state to get the abortion will it affect them.
God told me to drive to a Blue State.
😦
It isn't unusual for medical emergencies during 1st trimester.
Tell me you didn't read the article without telling me you didn't read the article.
"yeah. In my conversations with people who are for the bans, there is typically an absolute refusal to see those seeking abortion care as anything other than party girls willfully killing babies. 

I think it will take individual tragedies to change minds. I have literally wept with fear and grief while trying to explain to people who say they love me that this kind of law could very, very easily cause my death and I don't think anything I said sunk in. It would take my actual death, and even then they would probably just go ""oh what a tragedy"" and not think about how easily preventable my death was. 

I don't know. I'm not trying to be a downer. There are WAY more men who support reproductive rights now than there were ten years ago! But I think for a certain subset of the population, it's going to have to be something that deeply, horrifically affects their own life for them to pay attention."
Yes that’s exactly what I mean. It sucks but that’s what is going to have to happen to make them change. Only when they start to feel that pain will they care.
So the danger was a normal pregnancy?
"Yeah, I messed up. Sorry."
"If being septic is ""normal"" to you, then you might be a republican"
"Ignoring the other comments, are you saying you understand that pregnancy is dangerous but women should just die anyway?"
"No, you walnut. From the Legal Brief that is located IN THE ARTICLE:
 
Amanda was forced to wait until she was septic to receive abortion care, causing one of her fallopian tubes to become permanently closed. 

When Lauren M. learned one of her twins was not viable, she was forced to travel out of state for the abortion she needed to save her and her other baby’s life, who is due in several weeks. 

Lauren H. received a devastating fetal diagnosis two weeks after Roe was overturned, and in the chaos that followed, she was forced to travel to Seattle for an abortion. 

Pregnant again now, Lauren H. fears that Texas is not safe for her or her family. 

Anna was forced to fly across multiple states after her water broke, risking that she would go into labor or septic shock on the journey. 

Ashley had to travel out of state to for an abortion to save the life of one of her twins, and afterwards, fearful of documenting Ashley’s abortion, her Texas physician instead described her condition as “vanishing twin syndrome.”"
"Normal pregnancy can be dangerous.
It's also considered ""disability"" for F sake."
😇
"I went through this last year before roe was overturned (but I also live in CA so I don’t think it would have affected my ability to get a d&c). 

I had a twin pregnancy that was not viable and the natural miscarriage didn’t complete so I continued bleeding (a lot) and cramping for 3 weeks. When I went to the doctor they said it was urgent to do a d&c that day because I was at risk of hemorrhaging or sepsis, so they canceled other people’s appointments in order to fit my d&c into their schedule that afternoon. 

I would not wish this on any person. The fact that these women had to wait, travel, and may suffer infertility due to this FUCKED reality these “Christian” nut jobs are forcing us all into is beyond words. These people are fucking sick. The GOP is a fucking cancer."
Hugs sister. I’m so thankful you had access to care. I hope you’re doing better now!
"Ty! Life is a journey, but no one should have to go through what these women and others like them have gone through due to non viable pregnancies. I feel for them."
"So, McCarthy is colluding with Tucker Carlson (who was just exposed as lying to millions of his viewers in the Dominion voting machine case) to cover up the Jan 6th insurrection so the guy who started it, Trump, can win the presidency and try again...this includes downplaying attacks on the police during the riots...that's pretty fucked up."
Yeah because their farce is front page now. Cops escorted Jan 6th protesters. Whoops. Mistrials coming.
"If a cop helps you commit a crime, it’s still a crime. For example, if I decide to physically assault someone (without defense) and an on duty cop helps me, then I can still be charged with the crime. 

Spoiler alert: it’s been covered, many times, that some of the officers were helping the insurrectionists. This is not new to those of us that aren’t obsessed with YouTube, Parler, Fox News, newsmax, OAN. 

Trump did not pardon a single person that was charged with a Jan 6 crime, and he could have before leaving office. Why do you think that is? He pardoned 116 in January of 2021, and Inauguration Day was January 20th, he could have pardoned those that had been charged after Jan 6. He chose not to."
Dudes a trumper. He's lost on all of us.
"It’s not news to anyone paying attention. If you think Fox is one sided news but not MSNBC then there’s no point on having a conversation with you because you are already in the cult. You know nothing about me or what I watch.

If a cop helps you commit a crime, he committed a crime. If the crime is trespassing, then I think a cop escorting does make a difference. If a black man was escorted to the same place would you hope he gets four years?"
"I read Fox News regularly, and I watch a variety of news outlets. I actually rarely watch msnbc. 

I don’t disagree with you that the cops should be charged too if they helped. I do disagree with you that they can’t be charged with trespassing if a cop helped. I’m an attorney, but what do I know? 

Also, again, if they didn’t do anything wrong why didn’t trump pardon them before he left office? He pardoned a lot of people in January."
"I didn’t say they can’t be charged, I said it makes a difference if cops escorted them. I am no fan of Trump and I don’t care what you do (I know smart and dumb attorneys, myself) or what you watch, I just don’t like people presuming I watch something that apparently you read…? Good for you, I guess?

I also didn’t say they did nothing wrong. I think they were dumb, but lead by police and I think they are also being held as political prisoners. I think a mistrial is coming when FBI and police were escorting and manipulating the crowd. The cops also killed someone Jan 6th.

I’m not going to go back and forth anymore. I just think the whole thing was a shame. When Antifa took over part of a town in Oregon, and killed many people, that was a “summer of love” but when some people were escorted by police around the capitol building, that was an “insurrection.” I just don’t understand that mentality. But then again it comes from the same people that think you can pick whether you’re a man or a woman, but not who you are attracted to, unless you want to change that, but it’s not something you can change… Ay yi yi.

Thanks for your “service” Mr. Attorney."
"I’m a woman, and you’re welcome. Interesting that you just assumed I was a dude."
"I dated a female attorney for a short while… but on Reddit and talking politics, yeah, I did assume you were a man lol …we’re rude on the internet, it’s no place for a lady 😆 then again, if you can handle a court room, you can probably handle the internet so props to you 🤘have a good night and no hard feelings"
God bless the free market 😂

">In a statement issued later on Monday to clarify its position, Walgreens said it planned to dispense abortion pill mifepristone in any jurisdiction where it was legally permissible to do so.

Sounds like either the threat worked very quickly, or this is just an example of politicians using a company trying to follow the law as an excuse for grandstanding."
Time for more states to do the right thing as well - do we just abandon those needing it who happen to live in states where it is illegal?
New York should follow California.
GTFO!
I bet my old coworker with the Walgreens mortar and pestle W logo tattooed over his heart is feeling prettttyyyyy embarrassed
How does California do business with a drug store chain?
interesting that AGs can't be sued for threatening anyone.  walgreens is just protecting their business interests.  and - well - the governor ought to not threaten either.
What is the real impact to Walgreens though?  I guess nobody really knows the scope of the state’s business dealings with Walgreens at this time.  The state will probably need to form a committee to review this and make a recommendation.
I’ll still do business with them.
"Right, the market is there, only Walgreens refuses to serve it. If you don't believe in the free market, sell to the other states who also don't, like Florida."
"Either way, it's the right stance for the company."
We could probably get Michigan on board with that too!
"The state’s Medicaid and employee health insurance plans, for starters"
"Interesting, that’s not a law. Free market implies that different entities can choose to do business with each other or not, so why would they have to do business? It’s not a threat, it’s a business decision, and Walgreens is not entitled to California’s business."
"Yeah freedom of association sure is interesting. It was so interesting that they put it in the first amendment of the bill of rights. Newsom is the chief executive of the state, he's governor, not AG."
Such is the danger of private enterprise getting in bed with governments in the first place.
Nor is the governor entitled to make business decisions for everyone in the state. The state of California is not a company and he is not the CEO
Why would the AG be involved? The governor made an executive decision.
"They didn’t “get in bed with government,” the state of California was simply one of their customers"
Virginia company /j
Yes and private enterprise should know better than to do this.
Than to fill prescriptions for patients because of who that patient’s insurer is?
"I guess no more military technology then because we can't have contractors selling advanced weapons systems to the government.

Thank you for service. This thread was painful lol
Oké
Doesn't federal law supercede state law? Democrats should have passed some protections before the mercury brain mob took over
We are literally on a path with these pricks to tearing up the Constitution and returning to the resounding success we had under the Articles of Confederacy.
"From a strictly constitutional perspective, that is correct."
"So now we see why the Republicans want ""Small government"""
Confederation* sorry
Prove it.
"“Article VI, Paragraph 2 of the U.S. Constitution is commonly referred to as the Supremacy Clause. It establishes that the federal constitution, and federal law generally, take precedence over state laws, and even state constitutions.”"
"The federal government cannot commandeer the states. See the 10th amendment of the U.S. constitution (“the powers not delegated to the US by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people”). 

The Supreme Court overturned roe which held abortion was an inalienable constitutional right. There is also no federal law (eg the “to the people” part/elected members of congress have not passed a fed law stating abortion must be legal federally/in all states). 

Without a constitutional right or federal law, the states have the right to restrict access to this pill, regardless of fda approval. 

The federal government is allowed to dangle money to the states in exchange for the states doing what the feds want (like when they wanted the states to raise the drinking age to 21), but they cannot force the states to do thing unless there’s a federal law or constitutional right.

Personal take: overturning of roe was a fucking tragedy. Marijuana should be legal."
This is true but someone else pointed out to me that the statement is about the FDA not the FED. I could be wrong but I don’t think the FDA has that power.
"I see, the statement being about the FDA not the FED and the FDA doesn’t have that power.

The FED however can make it law which would supersede state law. 

Also I agree on Roe and Weed."
"The fda is a federal agency, within the department of health and human services. Fed agencies are under the executive branch. The executive branch can issue executive orders, but the legislature makes the laws. 

Congress (aka the legislature) passed a law that requires FDA approval of prescription drugs that are prescribed in the US. So, that’s where the FDA comes into play - without their approval, pharm companies can’t get their drugs on the mass market. 

So, you’re right. FDA approval does not mean the same thing as congress passing a law or a constitutional right."
"The FDA is established by the federal government and as such, is federal law. That’s how that works."
"Glad we can agree on something! :) I think we should learn more about this stuff in school. I did not know much about how government works until I went to law school. 

I know that’s the point of professional school, to learn more, but I went in with such little knowledge of how govt works that it was pathetic and I had a huge learning curve. 

I have to wonder if it’s on purpose they don’t teach us more about govt while we are in elementary school. The only class I remember that really delved into it was in high school, and it was only one course. Not enough imo."
The FDA isn’t law its an administration. The FDA by itself can’t override state law. Federal law can.
"The problem is finding where in the law is the text that gives the FDA the authority to do this. Agencies implement law, they're not supposed to make it."
We need massive education reform. Our schools are a joke.
And we agree again! 👏👏👏
"I treat them like colleagues from work. A rare visit and chat is nice, but I'll steer away from, ignore, or redirect any conversation topic that might get me in trouble with HR. If they insist on risking it, the visit it over and I leave with a smile and a wave."
"I had an agreement with my family that we would just leave politics out of our relationship, and it worked well. If I was over there and they were watching some garbage propaganda channel, I would ask politely if they wouldn’t mind changing it to something other than news (i know it’s propaganda not news but they are brainwashed). 

If politics did come up, I would change the subject as quickly as possible or avoid commenting. There was never any point in trying to engage. They are die hard republicans. 

I went no contact with them this year for different reasons, but this worked for me for many years. Good luck and I’m sorry your fam is indoctrinated."
There are a few that I can get along with no problem and are not on the weird “alternate facts” group. Others are very aggressive and engage in violent and religiously bigoted rhetoric toward liberals. The later I don’t even try to have a relationship with anymore.

"I honestly don't understand how people can consistently derive emotional sustenance from such a negative state.

"I had to go NC with all of them. I am a retired nurse, but worked through the pandemic as an ER trauma nurse. What I saw will haunt me forever. My relatives are down the rabbit hole. None have been vaccinated,  and quote fox News as gospel. Going NC saved my sanity."

"You just literally don’t acknowledge shit they say. At least it’s what I do with my dad.

Almost all my family are Trumpers.
"My entire family are MAGA supporters and have mutually agreed not to talk politics. If anyone can't agree to do that, avoid them. And for those that agree not to discuss politics and do so anyway, remind them of the agreement. Also, tell them you don't want it to ruin your relationships."
"I'm in the same boat. I have told them that I'm not engaging in politics and I mean it. I talk about literally everything else. Keep the visits short and the phone calls to once a week, maximum. Good thing I moved away from them a loooonnnggg time ago.  That is an option - move at least 3-4 states away if possible."
"You shouldn’t allow politics of any kind to affect your actual life. As long as a person is kind and considerate who they vote for doesn’t matter much to me, especially if it’s family."
"Yeah I mean, you pretty much have to disown anyone that doesn't sit on the same side of the aisle as you. Like, they need to know that your political views far outweight whatever relationship they've built with you over the course of however many years."
That's actually a great way to think of it!
"What's funny is even not knowing your reasons, it still is probably related. Fox News and other propaganda brainwash people regarding politics but it rarely stays just that, it always spills over. They   get people rage addicted and you'll see them become more like that in areas other than politics. The political brainwashing turns them into assholes, or brings out the asshole they were hiding."
"Thank you! Probably worth trying to get them to go no politics and hopefully they value our relationship more than their propaganda 🙂 sorry you had to go no contact though, I'm sure that's tough 😔"
Hahaha I never knew that existed! Checking it out now!
That's a great analogy!
Oof that sounds awful. I've got Trump people but no Q people at least to my knowledge 😔
Hahaha I've been trying this one out!
Same 😭
What is family except acquaintances with obligations?
"I agree. While the choice to go no contact was not a fight over politics, they have become more and more unhinged over time. 

My parents are also boomers so their mindset is abhorrent to me and frankly always has been. I think what helped the most is the space I was able to maintain due to living across the country and COVID. 

It would be nice to have a relationship with my bio fam, but I can’t change who they are and im unwilling to subject myself to their crazy anymore."
"You’d think it would be tough, but it’s actually been very easy. Their behavior has always been awful and got worse over the years, and they’re across the country, so it’s been fine! Also, I did tell them I’d like to engage with them if they are willing to involve a counselor, but no one responded lol so that pretty much says it all."
"Oh thank you! That's my very favourite kind of compliment, analogies are something I think about a lot. (partly because conservatives are so bad at them lol)"
It’s the healthier option. They’re happy with their exile.
Hahaha another good point!

"Dude says it ""can't be genocide"" because transgendered ""is not a legitimate category of being.""

Not a legitimate category of being! I didn't know only *some* humans are legitimate, and we all have to clear it with a republican before we can even exist. 

How can a human being be born, naturally and organically, who is somehow not ""legitimate?"" And furthermore, who the *hell* is he to appoint himself almighty arbiter of what is and is not a ""legitimate category of being?""

The hubris is stupefying!"
I'm guessing they think of trans people as some kind of social trend that people are being tricked into becoming. Like they can stop people from becoming trans if they stop the source of influence or something?

Has anyone confirmed the speaker’s sex?  This may need to be a door to door operation.
I’m a punk fan and there’s some songs that I unfortunately think are relevant or kinda relevant. The Zero Boys did Civilization’s Dying and The Dickies did a cover of Eve of Destruction. I also think It’s The End of The World As We Know It fits. There’s a lot of political punk songs.

"I'd like to have a deeper understanding of your comment. If you care to, would you elaborate?"
So what is that supposed to mean? What does transgenderism have to do with child molesters?

"Yes, that is also a way to say the exact same thing this headline says."

"I'm sure you agree that gender dysphoria is a real thing, most conservatives don't disagree with that fact. I'm just wondering what you would consider a normal amount of young kids identifying trans? Like most states only has one trans student in sports, that is hardly what I would consider ""exponential"". Maybe you don't feel that kids that age are capable of understanding what being trans means, if so, what age do you think a person has to be before they can be diagnosed with gender dysphoria?

Personally, with only 0.05% of the population identifying as trans, I feel that is it more that people are just comfortable committing they are trans. Much in the same way when Americans stopped oppressing left handed people that the amount of left handed people exponentially increased, not because of a trend, but because they were always left handed and they didn't have to hide it anymore."

"Well, we knew this was going to happen as soon as they targeted trans kids in sports, we knew it was never going to stop there and only escalate until they were calling for another holocaust."
By treating their gender dysphoria.
Not at all! Just a reframing of what it is that a person who changes their hormones/ cross dresses/ or gets surgeries is actually doing. Is it a man becoming a woman or vice versa? Or is that not what's happening.
"He's talking about the ideology not the people, watch the clip!"
"THe overwhelming majority of children that express gender dysphoria, who do not recieve intervention treatment (hormones, 'affirming care', etc.,), end up desisting naturally by the time they finish puberty and no longer experience the dysphoria

We don't play along with other dysphorias and cheer and help children continue such dysphorias.  We don't do it for people with body dysphorias like trans-abled people or children with anorexia.  We don'tdo that for any otehr mental problem like schizophrenia either.  Wed on't cheer anorexic girls and tell them that yes they are indeed as fat as they think and they should go ahead and lose all the weight theywant and support them as they do so.  We don't chop off people's arms because they believe their abled bodies are wrong and that they should be disabled.  We don't cheer schizophrenic people and agree with them that they have real other people inside their heads.  We give them actual mental treatment, and help them with their mental problems instead of applauding and encouraging them in those problems."
WTF is your definition of “eradicate”
Who is we and who is they
"They are changing their gender.  One might use the prefix trans-, which was designed for just that purpose long before it was applied to trans people.  Almost as if the word transgender was the word for it, without the need for ""reframing"".  We're not transbiology.  We're transgender.  Please, for the good of everybody involved, learn the difference."
Gee it sure doesn’t seem like the guy’s making a semantic point.
"That's a rather pedantic take, considering the rhetoric is basically calling to ban trans people from going out in public. He's saying that the idea of being trans is preposterous & that presenting oneself as trans should be forbidden in public. If they enshrine that into law, trans people would either have to stay in the closet or risk legal ramifications anytime they go out. Forcing trans people into the closet will absolutely, with 100% certainty, increase the rate of suicide among trans people. I'm not being hyperbolic when I say he's calling for the genocide of trans people."
"That's like saying ""the ideology of being black must be eradicated"" while not meaning the eradication of black people. They're literally the same"
"Being trans isn't an ideology, just like having a birth defect isn't an ideology."
It's scary that nobody is getting it. It's like the sub is a raving mob.
Being born trans is NOT AN IDEOLOGY the ignorance of people who spout that nonsense proves that they have no knowledge of what trans people are
"In 2021, the amount of youths between 6-17 diagnosed with gender dysphoria was 42,000. Out of that, 4,200, or 10%, was given hormone therapy. In your opinion that is too high? What do you think should be the acceptable amount for that?

So you would treat trans people the same as people suffering from schizophrenia and anorexia? You acknowledge this is a thing that exists, but don't believe they should be comforted. Do you think it is wrong for even adults to transition their gender? What do you think would be appropriate treatment to cure transgender people? Do you think they can even be cured through counseling and therapy? Would you discourage girls from wearing pants or boys from liking the color pink until they become a certain age?"
"Eradicate transgenderism, not transgender people."
"What about intersex people (born with both genitals) who were victimized by doctors who arbitrarily, in many cases, determined the gender that baby would become? I saw a documentary once that featured a 15 year old girl who had this nagging feeling that she should have been a boy. As it turns out, she was born intersex and the doctor removed the male organs thus turning the baby into a girl.

For people with gender dysphoria, they truly believe they are not their assigned gender. They don't just wake up one day and begin a gender transition program. They have to undergo considerable psychological & medical evaluations before any medical doctor will prescribe any treatment regimen. These are highly trained medical professionals evaluating each case performing the evaluations and subsequent treatment plan.

By turning gender dysphoria into a political issue, the harm to children with this disorder could possibly be self-inflicted harm that could result in death. Unfortunately, many of these politicians claiming to be saving children from harm actually don't care about the true cost of the legislation they are pushing."

"""We"" are pretty everyone who isn't Republican and by contrast ""they"" are the Republican Party."
So you are claiming that hormone therapy is FDA approved to treat gender dysphoria? That’s what you’re saying? Just making sure I understand what you think is fact.
"Also if that were true for all people who claim the title transgender, why are so many of them altering their biology with hormones, and altering their biology with surgery? Are you sure some people aren't convinced they are ""transbiology"" as you say?"
"Gender has no meaning. Nothing. It doesn't exist. Men can wear dresses, women can wear slacks. Men can be homemakers, women can be executives. If gender doesn't exist, transgender doesn't exist. Just be the man or woman that you are."
"I encourage you to watch the clip, as I think you still have not. He is talking about the ideology. He doesn't come anywhere near saying people who identify as trans shouldn't be in public."
"Here's the actual quote. “If transgenderism is true, if men really can become women, then it’s true for everybody of all ages. If transgenderism is false — as it is — if men really can’t become women — as they cannot — then it’s false for everybody too. And if it’s false, then we should not indulge it, especially when that indulgence requires taking away the rights and customs of many people. It if is false, then for the good of society — and especially for the good of the poor people who have fallen prey to this confusion — then transgenderism must be eradicated from public life entirely — the whole preposterous ideology, at every level.”"
Any thought system that gives credence to the concept of gender is an ideology. Just be yourself.
"I do think he chose the word eradicated to gain a bunch of attention, which definitely worked lol. but it's quite clear he is not talking about eradicating people. 

I do put a lot of the blame on the articles with libelous and untrue titles, but it's up to everyone to not just read a title and react.  He did get multiple articles to retract the untrue statements but some still exist. Like this one."
"ANY amount of hormone therapy for minors is unnaceptable.  And the overwhelming majority of them will desist from their dysphoria without such 'therapy'.

Name 1 right you are losing by acknowledging that trans people exist."
"I am myself, and people like you are trying to take that away from me.  ""Land of the Free"""
"Just be yourself as long ""yourself"" is in align with what the government considers to be traditional cultural values. You are free to practice whatever religion you want as a long as it is Christian, you are free to marry whoever you want as long as it is the opposite gender, you are free to wear whatever clothes you want as long as it matches your government assigned gender, you are free to have as many guns as you want as well!"
"You do realize we use hormone therapy to treat kids with cancer, right? That was it's original purpose. To so easily discredit it's use entirely would put the lives of a lot of kids at risk. When you say majority, how many do you imagine that to be? Not everyone diagnosed with it needs treatment, if that is what you are saying. And most need very little adjust, just changing their pronouns is sufficient. The ones that require medical treatment makes up a small amount of them.

I wonder if you actually consider it a mental illness if people can just desist from it? People with gender dysphoria suffer from a high rate of suicide. To help prevent that we comfort them by allowing them to express the gender they associate with. I imagine you would agree that any treatment of a mental illness that reduces self harm is a good thing, right? Unless you have another solution to reduce this self harm, the benefits of this treatment out weight the negatives. That is, unless you prefer the deaths of hundreds of kids rather than giving them hormone therapy."

Isn't that the service medical & psychological provide? They give parents their professional opinion concerning their child's diagnosis.

"That's SUPPOSED to be what they provide.  And for some time that's what they DID provide.  But now most are worried about being cancelled and losing their jobs, or have fully swallowed the garbage of John Money and believe in the trans idiocy."
"So what I'm hearing is physical changes are biological, so a trans person who changes their physical body is biologically the target gender?  Sounds good to me."
"Here's the thing, people are literally going to be able to change their chromosomes (genetic expression) in not too long from now-- Right now people can change their phenotypic expression (hormones and surgery), but eventually we'll be able to change both. This is the world that is evolving. I totally get where you're coming from, and I used to be where you are--so I know you're only there because you're not seeing the whole picture. It's time to just let it go and let people be who they want to be."
"So, no teaching religion, no politics, no anything for children until they are 18.  Got it.  Wait until they are adults to have any true life experiences, leave ALL ideologies out of it, including being a conservative, thoughts about gun ownership, or any of that.  No grooming!"

As an MMA fan I’m so happy to see people from the sport actually doing something like this. There are so many right wing nut jobs and and conservatives that make it hard to be a fan. Bless these people and their work.
Chef's kiss 😘💋
"Not surprised one of the MMA fighters saying this has Punk hair.

The Punk Movement has always been **deeply** anti-Fascist.  Indeed, I had an instructor (I won't say where, or in what, to protect him from the remote possibility of doxxing) who used to tell the class about street-fights he and friends often got into with Skinheads (who have always been Fascist-leaning) back in his Punk days, usually after said Skinheads said or did something extremely Racist and Fascistic.

The Punks may be one of the last bastions against Fascists in this country, in the end: much like how the anti-Fascist self-defense forces organized by the Communists in pre-Nazi Germany helped significantly slow the rise of the Nazi movement in the 1920's (after 1930 the Fascists started to grow put of control).

It's never Moderates who take the strong stances against Fascists necessary to prevent them brutalizing innocent people.  It's brave, salt-of-the-Earth types like the Punks- including the MMA ones in this article."

So many years conservatives claim being gay is a mental illness but yet they clearly are displaying the mental illness when they say nonsense like this. their obsession with the LGBTQ and what people do with their bodies is a mental illness. 


If you are a conservative and you are constantly thinking about what other people are doing behind closed doors then that’s perversion because what other people do behind closed doors doesn’t affect you so therefore you shouldn’t be thinking about that. you are a pervert plain and simple."

"Have you not been paying attention? This is all by design. The GOP is completely aware that it can’t win a popular election. This is a fact. The party has to rely on gerrymandering, the electoral college, and voter suppression. The aforementioned methods work great when voter turnout is below 30%.

The problem is that more people are voting now and the election margins are razor thin. Guaranteed seats are no longer guaranteed so a new strategy is in play. Radicalize your base and stack local governments with lunatics. This will supercharge states, counties, cities, and districts to make it impossible to hold fair elections. They can write the rules as they go and destabilize the government.

This is how fascists take control."

"Seriously?  How often do armed bandits break into your home, armed, and looking to kill you?  Are you a high level mafia guy?  Do you sell millions in illegal drugs?

I've lived in a home for almost 30 years, and never once has anyone entered said home to hurt me or my family.  We've been broken into, had a few things stolen, but nobody kicked open the door with a shotgun and started spraying bullets.

The problem, IMHO, with having a gun for protection, is that the gun becomes a solution, and then more and more situations start to look like problems that gun can solve."

You should watch this video interview with a Republican Oklahoma Senator and John Stewart for some of the issues with gun attitudes.

https://youtu.be/tCuIxIJBfCY

I think guns are fine, I personally love guns and would love to open carry. I definitely don’t think we should be allowed to open carry though.

The problem I and a lot of people actually have with guns is gun registration. For example a 13 year old buys a gun, who gets held as responsible? Only the 13 year old. 
Guns need to have a serial number, chip or some identifiers ideally on each part that can’t be removed so that someone could be held responsible if it ends up in the wrong hands. That’s all I really want.
For example Mexico has a major gun problem, well Mexico only has one gun store in the entire country. All their guns come from the USA illegally, and no one ever gets held responsible when those weapons are found used by criminals.

Also common sense is that more guns will equal more deaths and shootings, because verbal or physical altercations quickly lead to guns getting pulled and gets deadly when it would’ve otherwise been a non lethal altercation. There are obviously countless examples of this and it’s common sense"
"Good for you? I've lived in bad neighborhoods for a large part of my life and break-ins were very common. The world does not revolve around your curated bubble that will eventually pop. 

If you are not responsible enough to own a gun that is on YOU, not on everyone else. You don't have to take a gun with you, but you can use it to protect your home."
And hopefully the innocent person is the one committing the final violence.
Come on. This is about choice. I will not question someone’s personal choice to not own a gun. There can be many good personal and situational reasons not to. But I’ll also not tolerate efforts to prevent those who do want to exercise the right from doing so.
300 million guns in America are not enough.   It’s a bold take.   More must be better!

"Hungary is definitely not the most progressive country, but we need to stop comparing cities/countries to other nations. I only say this because I’ve heard several countries be referred to as turning into “Hungary” this past week. None of which in a way even actually relavent or representative of the issues at hand.  DeSantis is playing a bigoted power move, but he isn’t turning Florida into an Eastern European questionable democracy. Not to defend him in any way, but Disney shouldn’t have been a self-governing district in the first place. The main reason they are anyway is to avoid taxation. I would say Florida is starting to look more like 1960’s America than a Post-Soviet country. There is just an enormous amount of factors where the comparison of Florida to Hungary is laughable. I don’t think the author knows much about Hungary or Post-Soviet countries."
"Get ready for the down votes. Liberals think Florida is a cesspool of racism and bigotry and don't take the time to really inform themselves on what is really happening in Florida same as conservatives don't inform themselves on gender issues.  

Don't say gay is the buzz word and upsets liberals the same way that Critical Race Theory upsets the conservatives. And both sides are not fully informed on what either actually mean and what is actually happening inside the schools.  

It's is true that some bills were removed from elementary schools and if that upsets you, do you actually know the content of the book and why they were removed?

Critical Race Theory is just that, a theory that is similar to Karl Marx's Conflict theory in sociology.  It just provides a lens in how to identify and potentially solve societal problems."
"Florida is beginning to look like any other fascist state. If you fear it, ban it."
">Disney shouldn’t have been a self-governing district in the first place. The main reason they are anyway is to avoid taxation. 

It's actually the opposite. They needed to build giant infrastructure in a short span of time. If they didn't create their own area they would have bankrupt the surrounding communities. The people living around the park would have been on the hook for billions of dollars in bonding. Desantis realized this and totally changed his initial plan. When he was going to dissolve the district it would have landed giant costs on the surrounding communities - so instead he took over the board that runs the district.

Using political power to punish people who say and do things you don't like is exactly like any other autocratic state around the world."

"Sorry to burst your bubble, but I think philosophies are just different. Think of Conservatism as what makes a father great and Liberalism as what makes a mother great. Both are very important to a healthy nation. Right now we’re not healthy because both sides want a divorce.

Conservatives typically want wants best, just like Liberals typically do. The difference, in my opinion, is their point of view. The nuclear family built the USA to what it is today, and Liberals want more equity for all the differences minorities have had to deal with, especially years ago. Conservatives need to have healthy Liberals test them, from time to time, and visa versa. Healthy is the key word. Right now, we don’t talk to each other."

"Unironically, they don’t value your family at all."
"I agree. It’s difficult to watch it all go down. I know generations before us have fought battles and won, but i think the internet and propaganda outlets have changed the game.

They see it but hat our country so much that they encourage it
"The media does a great job making people think both side of any argument is valid and worth considering. Republicans weaponize this mentality to great effect.

It’s fucking disgraceful and sad that this is how they choose to live their lives.

There is more to life than this fuckery that we are being forced to watch."
"That's right.  They get voted into power, screw everything up to make money for their donors & themselves.  Then democrats get in power because people become fed up.  Democrats try to fix things that the Republicans break & try to grow the middle class.  Republicans lie & spin things to get back into power, rinse & repeat.  Its the Democrats who work for the people of America.  The Republicans work for their donors & themselves only.  They couldn't do it without Fox news, which is why they need to keep that propaganda machine going.  We are broken due to their corruption!"
"Agreed. The gop knows that if they stoke the fuck out of their base’s anger, fear, and bigotry, then that is all they need. They also lie to them.  

While I’m not excusing the gop voters’ failure to recognize all these things, I do think there’s a difference between the liars and the people they’re lying to. 

They are in cult of a personality and ignorance, and if you talk to anyone that’s ever been a part of a cult, they’ll tell you it’s hard to convince people that their entire belief system is a grift and that they should get out."
"Not so sorry to burst your bubble, pal. 

What you describe is an idealized theory, and it has nothing to do with the modern conservatism that devolved into trumpism."
"What government agencies have you worked in/for/with? Do you have experience working with a Democratic governor and a Republican governor? 

I have seen the former Democratic governor of Nevada support state agencies and allow them to do their work. I have seen the current Republican governor hurt state agencies and prevent them from doing their work. 

Lol at the “sorry to burst your bubble” part. You’re not “bursting my bubble.” I see it happening in real time and am living in reality. If you’ve never worked in government and seen the difference between how it functions under a democrat and under a republican, then you don’t have the full picture of how this shit goes down. 

I would love to hear more about all the things the republicans have done to help the country. Let’s start from the bush admin to present. Please enlighten me!"
"What you described is true for(a number) of conservative voters, but not current republican politicians. Theres a difference. Conservatives and republicans right now are not even close to being the same thing. Before 2020 there was still a couple conservative politicians left in the republican party who did genuinely want whats best for ppl and the country. Unfortunately since they had morals and a spine they spoke out against the big lie and after that ppl threatened their families until they decided to leave politics all together. There are still conservative voters who are good people and want whats best for the country and people but just have different ideas on how to get there vs liberals. These people have 0 representation in the current republican party today. Buut since we only have a 2 party system and they have voted R their whole life theyre just going with what they know, plus a lot of them arent aware of whats really going on due to the conservative media being captured by these same republican donors/elites/politicians. I think we all need to find a way to separate who were talking about when we talk about the dark turn the republican party has taken, because just because the party is trying to tear this country apart, theres a good amount of conservative voters left who just want whats best. That being said theres a lot of who I would call republican voters instead of conservative, who are behind everything the party is pushing as well."
">Think of Conservatism as what makes a father great and Liberalism as what makes a mother great

...I'm sorry, what?

""Conservatism"" has always been about protecting powerful, vested interests. Modern conservatism has devolved into a grotesque coalition of racists, Christian nationalists, unabashed opportunists, and anti-intellectualism.

There isn't anything ""great"" about it. If it is like a father in any way, it would be a drunk and abusive one."
"I get what you mean.

Conservatives preserve what works. Liberals try new things and ideas. Both are a needed counter balance. With out liberalism, the world stagnate. Without conservatism, there is no stability. This works best when there is communication."
"I do not claim to know everything about politics (nor do I want to) and I’m no history major, but I think the Ronald Reagan admin. was the start of the shift towards more obstruction and less governing. 

Nixon did a lot of great things for the country that no one talks about because the bad things he did overshadow the good (which is understandable). For example, I believe his admin created the EPA."
They're pawns. Absolutely pawns. We're living in a goddamn oligarchy!
The conservatives agree on the fundamentals more than the broader collective that is the Democratic Party. Republicans are largely from the same religious background.
Agreed. :(
"I don’t live in a bubble, modern conservatism is more complicated than just “Trumpism.” In fact, a lot of the party voters prefer the policies of Trump, but not his personal actions. When I talk to conservative voters, they tend to talk about how they vote for a person right for the job, and when I talk to liberal voters they tend to talk about how much they like the person and who is the better perceived leader. They voted a half-dead person to office that called people fat, called people “not black” if they considered voting for Trump, shared a bank account with his son and bragged about getting people fired in other countries. Including his ties with Ukraine which may ignite WW3 if we aren’t careful, now that there’s rumors of Russia and China teaming up.

When Trump was President, I didn’t vote for him on 2016, but did in 2020. There was literal peace in the Middle East. No new wars. Economy was booming. Of course Trump was praised! His personal life and rhetoric is not always politically correct, but neither is it for most people in the actual country. While I think the President should be above that, I think you misunderstand if you think this is all about Trump. Conservatives were just as surprised when Trump got elected as Liberals were."
A corporate oligarchy. And it seems to have become more extreme post Covid.
I agree with you. I also think polarization is more extreme.
"oh jesus fucking christ here we go again.  instead of even considering taxing capital gains or wealth, they'll come after the tiny percentage of people still in the workforce who can actually afford \_anything\_ for retirement.

I worked for 25 years paycheck to paycheck before getting enough security in my career to be able to afford to save anything.  Ill be lucky if I can pay my mortgage off before I retire, and have enough saved, plus social security, to afford food, electricity and property taxes.  and I'm among the luckiest of gen X."
Tax the fucking rich. The end.
"The super wealthy aren’t depending on 401ks, but it’s the pension replacement for people who have normal jobs. First get rid of the carried interest loophole which benefits hedge funds. Eliminate favorable treatment of passive income. Raise the top marginal tax rate to 50 percent and eliminate the salary cap on social security taxes so that people making over $200,000 will still be paying (that last one will ding me, for sure, but fuck it…we need to preserve the safety net)"
How does that make any sense?
"Take the money from the rich, when they complain.  Give them the French treatment."
Counterpoint: let’s just improve social security. Make it an actual livable pension fund.
"We need to cut the FICA rates back to pre-Reagan/Greenspan Commission.  


The increase was only meant to be temporary to build a cushion for the bulge of retiring Boomers. This increase ended a 'private savings function' for too many households. The brick being shat in DC by the GOP is the day when the SocSec trust fund becomes a net draw against the government rather than a source of funds to spend. That could mean the end of low tax rates for the Uber-Rich who have been reaching into the Treasury to take out money since Reagan.

 We should ALSO raise the income cap for how much income is subject to FICA withholding. This will make up for some of the reduced rates...$500K or a $1M of income should be paying in. My own druthers would be a cap based on multiples of the median household income. Thus, the cap would not need new legislation or regulation to change with the times.  


Also, we should eliminate the matching contribution for the self-employed (and only the self-employed) at 3X or 5X of the median income.  


Lastly, any changes should be 'stepped in' over 5-7 years so as not to shock the economy into recession and to permit assessment and re-evaluation of effectiveness.  


...but we'll spend two years prosecuting a man who attempted a coup and asking ourselves if Biden is too old to run...   


Anyone still laughing at Al Gore's 'lock box'?"
"401k contributions get a tax break but 401k distributions are taxed as regular income.  In other words, you pay the tax later instead of now.  This is actually going to be a huge source of tax revenues for the government.  It would be dumb to fuck with it and risk steering a whole generation of people into other strategies for retirement imo."
401k? That doesn’t even make sense.
What?
"This suggestion is idiotic. We could fix social security without benefit or age adjustments by 1) eliminating the income cap that exempts payroll taxes on income above $162,000 and 2) means test benefits so that anyone with assets above $5 million (number debatable) does not draw any benefit."

Preaching to the choir my man
Psst so is CNN
"Not just Fox, but everything you see on your television is propaganda."
as with most networks on the far end of each side. It goes both ways.
"This isn’t a tit for tat comment, and I’m not saying they’re all the same, but there are very few news outlets that aren’t propaganda. Fox just slings the propaganda you personally don’t like."
All major news media is propaganda.  Fox does a terrible job at hiding it.
"All 24 hour news has become propaganda.  It is on fact not news it is just people's opinions on the news but we Americans are too stupid to tell the difference.  

The goal is not to inform but make a profit and push the agenda of the higher ups who run the network.  The easiest way to tell is story selection.  They only choose to report the stories they fit their agenda. 

To say Fox is the only one guilty is wrong. MSNBC, CNN,  and even the major networks are now becoming guilty of agenda pushing rather than reporting the days events."
"Yes and New York Times, NPR, Newsmax, MSNBC, OAN. It’s all propaganda."
"They’re all propaganda, no matter what “side” they are on"
"Ummm, any news outlet is propaganda…"
"Whenever some outfit like the LA Times comes to this conclusion, I'm always reminded of the time Obama had them removed from the press corps and all the other news outlets ran to their defense calling them legit. Our country really is broken."
True. But then again the same is true for CNN.
Naw I don’t think any news is really propaganda. That’s kinda conspiracy theory ish. No news is propaganda really. That implies there is a certain underlying political or social motive and goal to accomplish. Or to control the population. They are just doing what they do simply for views and dollars.  I don’t think any news is much more than that. Everything around is about money money money.
Amen- slimy bastards!
"So, water is wet and Tucker Carlson draws whatever bullshit conclusion he makes up on the spot about something that happened in the news?"

Journalism is dead atm, outside of independent internet outlets. Don’t say the wrong thing as a journalist on the wrong mainstream media outlet— you’ll get canned.

Bill oreily, tucker Carlson, Don lemon, Brian seltzer— they’re all the same propaganda puppets"
this is not news
Yeah. So what do we do about it?

He saw what the perceived ‘liberal media bias’ did to his hero, and he became determined to undo the Fairness Doctrine, unleash Murdoch, Limbaugh and eventually Fox News on the world and the rest is history."

I did not say they were the same. I said they’re both propaganda outlets. If you don’t acknowledge that all media does propaganda they will pull the wool over your eyes at some point.

It seems we're on the same side (protecting the little guy from the big guy). I'm just really mad at fox for putting ratings over truth and wrecking 40% of America's faith in elections. It will haunt us.
"I think we are as well. I happen to work in the msm, but that is all I’ll divulge on that. They all do the exact same thing, it just depends on who’s cutting their checks. Pfizer and big pharma in general are cutting the biggest checks for most of msm on the left so you will never hear a peep out of them. This has forced them to be less honest about everything over the last couple years, so Fox is getting higher ratings than the rest of them. None of them care about people, they care about money and a narrative that keeps their audience tuned in. I promise you, NPR and NYTs are just as bad as Fox News."
Last thing I'll say on the matter is that NPR doesn't have sponsors. They don't care what the ad rates are. They have no reason to cheat for market share. Giving equal time to both sides (when one obviously cares nothing about children once they're born) is a false dichotomy.

"A large percentage of NY voters agree that Rep. Santos needs to go.

>*Democrats, independents and Republicans all agree - Rep. George Santos has got to go. A new poll found that 66 percent of New York voters across the state believe the Long Island Republican should resign from Congress, according to the Siena College Research Institute Survey. That’s up from 59 percent last month.*

Independents, Democrats and Republicans want Rep. Santos to leave.

>*While 72 percent of Democrats want him out of office, so do 63 percent of independents and 58 percent of Republicans.*

Rep. Santos has really found a way for everyone (except Rep. McCarthy) to agree on unanimously.

>*""The ‘good’ news for Santos is that even in these hyper partisan times, he’s found a way to get Democrats, Republicans and independents to agree about a political figure. The bad news for Santos is that the political figure they agree on is him, and they overwhelmingly view him unfavorably,” said Siena College pollster Steven Greenberg.*

Not only elected officials? But voters are tired of his antics.

>*Voters also dislike Santos. Some 64 percent of them view him unfavorably, up from 56 percent in January.*

Rep. Santos lied so many times that he will be investigated for a long time.

>*He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in a Long Island swing district last November based on a largely fabricated résumé. He’s facing investigations by state, federal and international agencies on a range of potential crimes from campaign finance violations to pet charity fraud.*

So? You wrote a fake resume?  That's all you did?

>*Santos insists he merely embellished his résumé and never broke any laws.*

Rep. Santos campaign is eerily reminiscent of one term (disgraced) former President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice.__

>*Maybe George Santos’ real problem is that he aimed too low. While the newly elected New York congressman is facing calls from some in his own party to step down after revelations that he fabricated much of his life story in his campaign, a fellow New York Republican seven years earlier ran on an even larger raft of lies. Voters made him president.*

OoOooOoooOo. The edge lord speaks again! Who the fuck cares about this shithead.
Elon Musk is a sock puppet for the GOP.
Sort of like when you criticize the Christian church it's instantly labeled religious persecution by Christian White supremacists.
Of course he did
But of course the guy born and raised in a racist country would defend the rich racist white cartoonist.
"Musk’s clearly has no understanding what racism is, how it is operationalized, nor how it is technically defined. These comments are to be expected from a white man living in a white supremacist system, and a classic example of what is termed as “White Fragility” as detailed by Robin DiAngelo. The bottom line is he is proving again and again that he is a small man who lacks emotional intelligence."
"Yes, of course he jumped in to defend the racism.🙄"
"Elon Musk is anti-black/Asian/ white-people-who-disagree-with-Elon/American/Hispanic/Whale/Aboriginal/Indigenous peoples/Inca/Vagina/Trans/hygiene (that's right children and parents, you smell the Musk, it's stranger danger time)"

He is truly insufferable.
"Elon Mush is a ""South African"" white. His take on race is colored by his past."
"Did anyone read exactly what Scott Adams said? I see a lot of headlines and opinions about what he said and that it was a ""racist tirade,"" but I didn't see anywhere exactly what his words were. I'd prefer the media just report exactly what he said so we can make our own judgements."
Why can’t we separate the artistic work of someone from their personal beliefs?
Elon Musk can bite my ass.
Twitter is literally becoming r/WhitePeopleTwitter
"Doesn't he already have the greatest wealth drop in recorded history? Lol.

I’m just saying we as liberals seem to have descended far from defending reasonable free speech at any cost to just censoring or canceling anything anyone might find offensive. That’s the wrong approach in my opinion and anti American. Bill Maher is doing a lot of good work right now on this topic.
Wry commentary on the modern day workplace is art now?
For now. His rise to power was cooked in lies. All of which are apparent. Takes time.
"No one is censoring anyone. Adams can create whatever he wants. He’s not guaranteed protection from consequences of being a douche. None of us are. Sometimes the consequences are positive, especially if you’re a Republican. Maybe this is just a calculated ploy to garner attention from right wingers. Like Musk. Next thing will be Taylor-Green waving a comic strip in the air decrying the Anti-Dilberts."

i thought you guys were the party of freedom?"
"Tbh I agree that there is a lot of hatred on both sides and that we both have our hypocrites. Politics in America have never been so polarized. (Or maybe across the world, too, but I wouldn't know that intimately)

To me though, I believe conservatives win on the hypocrite fight, as they want to brand themselves as the party of free speech, but are out there banning books and drag performances and whatnot and championing Christianity when our very foundation has been one of religious freedom. Or it was supposed to be."
Sounds more like you're a liberal to me.  The only tweaks would be getting a better understanding of the abortion issue and transgender rights. Outside of that everything else you mentioned are pretty much liberals ideals.
"
> Hello, I'm Aaron, a 16 y/o moderate conservative. I've not been into politics very long but I like to debate people with different views.

 Debate less given your nascent interest in politics and young age. Wisdom and understanding comes from *listening*, not from talking. You'd be better served to hear others and take in as many vantages as you can, as opposed to debating. Hear people out as opposed to trying to create a response; especially some sort of ""gotcha"" question. 

> ~~basic things I support are things like racial~~ equality, ~~same-sex marriages, and improvements to education and social security networks.~~

Those are all the same thing if we consider an approach to equality that is truly equitable for all. Consider your core beliefs, not individual nuances there of. You either accept that equality should be a core aspiration or you don't. Don't allow subsets of equality to be removed due to other forces. 

> On the other hand, I believe the second amendment shouldn't be repealed 

Good thing no one is attempting to do that, then. 

The better point is to understand the concept of the constitution as a *living document.* The second amendment was added at a later date upon considering contemporary realities and motivations. 

The best part about the constitution is this ability to change with the times. No one living in the 1700s could anticipate what life would be like in 2023. However, they could understand the need for self governance and changes in objective reality. 

Contemporarily there is an obvious and clear gun violence issue - from both individuals and the state. What should be done to address it is not a black and white answer. The point I'd drive home here is that amendments to the constitution are it's greatest feature and we should be open-minded and willing to consider the abilities to construct our laws to align with contemporary realities as opposed to considering them inflexible and infallible. 


> and things like illegal immigration should be looked at more seriously. 

No person is illegal. 

> I am pro-choice until a few weeks into pregnancy once the embryo begins to properly develope, which then I turn pro-life. 

Women may not even know they're pregnant at this point. 

We also must consider the rights of those women. 

We must also balance that with the religious freedoms you previously stated you endorse protection for carte blanche. As a member of the Satanic Temple, this religion states that ""One’s body is inviolable, subject to one’s own will alone."" Additionally TST does not endorse that life begins at conception, and further provided for a religious based abortion ritual. 

You either support religious freedom or you support religious freedoms for only those religions you subjectivelt approve of. 


> The most controversial opinion I have would probably be that I am against trans peoples, as the entire concept doesn't make sense in my eyes. 

Just because it doesn't make sense in your eyes doesn't mean that it should be allowed for people to have freedom and autonomy to make what choices they see best fit for their lives. Your opinion literally does not matter in restricting their freedoms to live as they choose to do. Believing that you have any right to interject, interfere with, or to even have your opinion considered as a part of controlling how they live is incredibly myopic and frankly arrogant. 

We do not govern, vote, or create laws for the purpose of making people live like we want them to or to force the world to align with how it ""makes sense in our eyes.""  We strive to Legilsate in a manner that provides for protection of freedoms of individuals to have autonomy over how they live.

If it doesn't make sense to you, that doesn't matter. That's an issue of you not being educated enough about the situation. You can be ignorant of it. You can not understand it. You can dislike it. But to state that you're *against* it as in supporting legislation to. Limit the freedom of transgendered individuals goes against your previous comments stating you support equality.  

We cannot support making individuals second class citizens just people we don't like what they're doing.

> Economically I lean further right than in most things. I believe federal spending should be cut down (See the United States massive debt issue) and in lowering taxes (Or at the very least, putting that money into something useful).

This is a much more complicated issue. It's not a left or right issue. Both sides in contemporary America encourage massive spending and engage in graft and corruption. 

> The biggest issue I believe in politics is the massive hypocrisies both sides make, and just how much hatred there is in the system. 

You literally said you're against trans people. That's pretty hateful. 

> A compromise is not a bad thing, no matter how hard radicals try to make it seem. 

There is no compromising on considering humans illegal or subject to limitation on their bodily autonomy. 

You have a lot of growing to do. 
Again, I'd suggest listening more and understanding your limitations given that you're so young. Critically think. Appraise underlying motives and the veracity of statements. Identity core beliefs and integrate your understanding of the world based upon those. 

Good luck."
No thanks. Get older and also maybe a clue before you are worth debating.
If I meet one I would love to have my views challenged. If I am wrong then I'll change my opinion.
"You act as if it's the exact same thing. It isn't. I disagree with the idea of a transgender person. There are only two genders, Male and Female, these genders are determined by chromosomes. This is science."
"Except that being trans is something in the person’s head, rather than tied to science. You’re free to think what you want (at least you’re supposed to be able to), but not free to force others to agree.

What makes someone a man or a woman, if not biological? A soul? That tends to not be the consensus for people that think they were born in the wrong body.

If suicide prevention is the goal, then I think they should study why post op suicide rates are extremely high. I personally think that we should celebrate the spectrum we NATURALLY are, and learn to accept ourselves. We will all live more fulfilling lives. I think especially when children are involved with receiving trans propaganda, it’s disturbing to say the least. Being trans is a trend they can’t take back."
"I absolutely agree and I am not actually religious myself. However, I've seen plenty of liberals toss their tolerance right out the window once something they disagree with comes up. Also I wasn't aware of the book banning, did you have a source I could see for myself?"
"No, I'm definitely not. I find myself leaning more into conservative policies than liberal ones. The first few mentioned are definitely liberal talking points and I do agree with them, but the economic issues, along with the second amendment and illegal immigration matters are all conservative ideals. US globalism and funding of domestic and national security are things I hadn't mentioned which I have generally conservative opinions on."
"So, I shouldn't form my own opinion and should only listen to others... Right...

These arguments are either non-existent or completely miss what it is I said. 

Guess I'll just go sit in a corner."

"Well, for some liberals I am sure this is true, but from what I see it's just that liberals won't particularly like you if you say something like sexist, racist, homophobic or whatever. Sure a lot of them won't be very nice about it either and may even insult you. 

However this is not the breach of free speech conservatives claim it is, what is actually a violation of free speech are the aforementioned book banning... thanks to u/Biishep1230 for linking. IE actual legislation being made at the state level. Not someone with a Steven Universe avatar on twitter calling you a homophobe."
"I'm curious where you got the idea that liberals support illegal immigration. 

Kinda the same with second amendment. The line isn't no guns, it's more like maybe we shouldn't have access to military firearms over the counter. I'm in a rural area and I don't know a single liberal who doesn't own a gun, and a great many enjoy shooting. 

Lastly the economic stuff. I know it's cynical but my view is the government is gonna take your money, like it or not. Your choice in the matter is how they use it, not if they take it.

I'm not trying to razz you just reading through your replies and commenting a little. Thanks for being willing to engage in debate!"
"I didn't tell you to do that. I said consider that you're not in a place to ""debate"" at this stage and that you'd be better served by listening. Ie - asking for people to explain more and listening more when they speak with consideration as opposed to simply hearing and attempting to figure out how to combat their points. 

>These arguments are either non-existent or completely miss what it is I meant. 

Idk what you mean by this.

But again, they're not necessarily meant to be ""arguments."" How we govern ourselves should not be confined to thinking in terms of tribalistic ""debates."" It's not a sport. It's real life. It should be holistically considering what provides for the best protections and benefit of all people.

>Guess I'll go sit in a corner.

Interesting.
"And what there is to understand is that not every conservative is a sexist, racist, homophobe. It isn't an issue of free speech necessarily but one of the general media attempting to silence differing opinions and statements which aren't even offensive.

"Mainly, lack of action against it. I've seen many who blatantly disregard border security. Of course they are probably just the loudest out of everyone but it looks to me like the republican side of things advocates for better border security. Personally I think legal immigration should be made easier for those with something to offer and that illegal immigrants should be deported back to wherever they came from.

Similar thing with gun control in that it's probably the loudest of you all talking. I do agree with better regulation of firearms, but we don't exactly have access to military firearms. A gun sold at a gun shop is actually tuned back a bit.

Economic stuff, I agree. Taxes are inevitable but it's seeming more and more rare that it's put towards something useful. With how little the US really has to offer today you'd think tax wouldn't be so high.

Our founding fathers wore wigs, make and tights.  It was completely acceptable and the height of fashion then.  Today we would say that male is dressing like a female.   Now if you want to inspect their genitals then I think you have a different debate on your hands here.   Meanwhile, what do we do with someone who says they are transgender?  What government action should be taken. (Hint: if you say none… you have a liberal view on Transgender).    Finally, you personally are free to dislike transgenders all you want.  That right however, ends with you.  You don’t get to impose your belief system on someone else and limit their freedom to be who they believe they are."

This journey will be more of a marathon, and less of a sprint maybe temper your expectations for that.

Consider that the issue at hand isn't the arguments being put forth, but maybe it's your approach to considering them."
"Read what Juttep1 commented to you.  That’s the gift.  That’s the feedback.   Listen more.  Critical thinking.  That’s spot on for everyone, including you.  Don’t get mad  and “go sit in a corner” when solid feedback is given.  Just my take."
I have met over 200 people. None of them identify as transgender and this I know.
"Because... One is real, one is not. I wasn't trying to force what I think onto anybody, As the whole post says, I'm only here to debate others. I said what I personally believe and if that is imposing my beliefs onto others then you should take a long look in the mirror. The action taken by the government towards people who say they are transgender when in reality they are not, should be to consider them as their true gender. Many founding fathers also owned slaves, by your logic that should be legal today because the times don't change."
"I think I'll stick to my way, it's working enough for me so far."
"Dude... Everything I have said has been a product of critical thinking. I never got mad, I'm actually enjoying doing this, that was an intentionally childish rebuttal."
"Transgender people don't identify as transgender, they identify as male or female loosely speaking. I'm curious how you know people are what they say they are."
"Unfortunately, your side has and is currently working in several states to increase the suicide rates of trans youth.  You may wipe your hands and say ""It's only my personal beliefs"", but your support has life and death ramifications in the real world.  You could, instead, support people choosing these things for themselves, you know, personal freedom and all of that."
Classic I'm 16 and know everything. I don't even know why I bothered.
"Which seems out of place since nobody else has behaved that way.   Nobody is treating you like a child here.  It weakens your points to act out like that.  He was simply asking you to listen, learn, think.  You reacted in a childish way.  You just said so.  This isn’t really a debate anymore when you do that.  Pity."
I fail to put it into words but I can assure you I have never met a transgender person.
"Choose love.  Always choose love.  Lover over hate.  When we ALL do that, we truly are all free."
"My support does literally nothing, nor do I support either side, I cannot vote for anything. As to any suicide rates, improvement of mental health services is something I condone entirely."
I never said or implied that. I don't know everything and I don't act like it. I say this respectfully what I saw from you was nonsense. I do pay attention to the points thrown in by others and I do that every time I talk with people. Meanwhile you're over here acting like I'm ignorant because I disagree with you.
"It's Reddit, baby, we do a little trolling.

Seriously, though, If I hadn't mentioned the word ""trans"" it really wouldn't have been a debate regardless .

And he did treat me like a child, that was his first point."
"You'll get no argument from me.

""If love is not the answer, then we've just asked the wrong question"".   Wookifoot"
"You seem like an honest kid who's heart's in the right place, until trans rights come up.  Why is that?  Who hurt you?"
So you can troll but he can’t.  Cool. Spoken like a true conservative.  Right on brand with you can do it but when others do it you get mad.  10pts
"Thank you, I do my best to be honest and unbiased. No one hurt me, it's just how I see this topic."
"But wait a minute, I thought you said no one here was treating me like a child. 

>Right on brand with you can do it but when others do it you get mad.

Also, as I said, I wasn't mad."
"YOU said he was treating you like a child.  YOU felt that way.  I just validated your feelings.  Nothing more.  I don’t think he treated you that way but you did. You said so.  I’m not going to deny how YOU felt.  But then you trolled him?  
You: “It’s Reddit” (give excuse to your behavior)
Also You: Let’s debate!  
Protip from me.  Be a debater or be a troll on Reddit.  Both are 100 cool, but hard to do both at the same time.   Peace✌️"
The trope: “I don’t care until it effects me.” Enjoy the karma
"Why isn't he happily deporting himself?

On another note: isn't his wife a US citizen, thereby making him eligible for citizenship?"
Guy lives about 10 mins from me in San Benito since then has taken down his Trump flag .

"The modern definition of a conservative, completely unable to empathize with anything until it happens to them and then their case is special or justified. See all the pro-life women who get abortions."
"Look on his face screams ""ain't that some shit"""
Please leave and come through the proper channels ie: get in line and apply for citizenship
"Inspector Javert, modern edition"
Deport him.
Karma is a bitch!
"CNN leaves out how he got hired. Who, what, where, when, and…Aah, that’s probably enough. 

I have to certify I’m a citizen to get a rental car. Doesn’t the Border Patrol check into these things?"
I wonder why federal investigators were looking into him. How did they end up with his Mexican birth certificate? Way more questions than the article addresses.
"Based on the headline and all the comments I was expecting the guy to be a politician writing and voting on immigration bills, not a US Customs and Border Protection officer."
"Pretty much. Everyone is suddenly special and unique when it happens to them, but until then, they're all just a bunch of criminal vermin that should shipped around the country like dirt for a political side show...ah, to be an ignorant conservative with no conscience....same as it ever was."
"If the Republican Party writ large can be said to have any guiding principals at all, they are these:

He said in the article the petition through his was was rejected
That’s not how things work at all. Just because you’re married in the US to a citizen does not make you any more likely to gain citizenship than if you weren’t .
">since then has taken down his Trump flag .

LOLOL. For safe keeping, he should shove it up his ass."
The only moral illegal is my illegal
Sad trombone.
Dad got him a fake birth certificate that he had thought was his real one his whole life.
It says he applied for a visa for his brother.
"It can make him eligible for a green card.  

It's staying here legally that makes you eligible for citizenship."
"Kid: Dad, I got a great new job!

Dad: Oh dear"
Being married to someone that’s a citizen also does not make one eligible for a green card. My sister in-law is going through this right now.  Actually in the same state and county . Being illegal regardless makes it harder to get anything unlike popular belief. Marriage to a citizen does nothing to effect immigration status nor helps get status.
"My buddy got married in Japan, came home and went through 18 months of hell working to get his wife a resident visa, despite the fact that they had a child, Another 3 years after that to get her a green card, even though she has a degree in childhood education, a high demand field."
"Has that changed in the past 10 years?  I had an undocumented brother in law that got a green card after he married my cousin.  

Was it the birth of their child that made the difference?  

If marriage makes no difference how are mail order brides a thing?"
It’s rough for sure . The entire system needs a overhaul. Those who never had to deal with it believes it’s all peaches and crème and that’s not the case at all.
I wonder if that includes US states full of people calling for the overthrow of the government? Such as Garbage Barge Marge in GA?
What does this even mean?
Start with Saudi Arabia!
Must be tough to be intelligent but have to say dumb stuff to appeal to your base
"so - Russia, then?"
The party of hate thinks everybody hates us. So how's that going to work?
"If we were to list governing bodies that hate the US, the GOP would be at the top of the list"

"Ms. Haley is opening her mouth and putting her foot in it.

Meaning?

She is displaying her lack of brain cells.

>*Haley said in an op-ed in The New York Post that taxpayers deserve to know where U.S. foreign aid is going and would be “shocked” to learn that much of it is supporting “anti-American” countries and causes.*



Once again? She is a deceiving America with this kind of threatening talk.


>*Backing American allies and friends like Israel and Ukraine is smart. Sending our tax dollars to enemies isn’t,” Haley said. “That’s why I will cut every cent in foreign aid for countries that hate us. A strong America doesn’t pay off the bad guys.”*

She is not saying anything new here.

>*Haley, who previously served as ambassador to the United Nations under the Trump administration and governor of South Carolina, said she often saw countries that “bashed” the United States in public and then privately “begged” it for money.*

She is also quite aware of the United Nations charter and what it means to be a member."
There just openly being hateful now. Guess this is the new era of Republicans.
I'm sure you make the people of India proud
And that behavior by Trump is gang violence created the huge refugee problem at our southern border.
Hey now… We voted the hell out of this place and made it Blue. Fuck large Marge and her cavalcade of idiots.
It is truly abhorrent what people will say out loud now. Things they used to keep inside? They scream out at the top of their lungs.
“Countries that don’t have oil”
"She's riffing on ""Islam hates us"".  All moot though, she will never be President"
"By ""us"", she means Republicans."
"If you take the words at face value, it sounds like she wants to kick half of the southern states out of the USA"
"They purchased $ 2 B + (Kushner and Meadows) worth of protection in the last administration.

Supposedly under investigation now"
"I really don’t think she’s that smart. Not Kevin McCarthy-level dumb, but really just an average pol who leveraged the Republican love for tokenism into a more powerful position than she ever likely would have had"
Oh no there will be exceptions right? 😉
She seems to be from the Trump school.
So true. They can't see the truth because their lies and subterfuge are so overwhelming.
Yes. Very much so. Reminiscent of her former boss.
"We don't give aid to every country, but most of them (like a small list of those we don't give to). Anti-American sentiment is high in many of them, so it does make you wonder why we give them money sometimes. 

OTOH, someone at the UN should know why in most cases. For example, they don't like us in Pakistan, but we give money to help keep them on our side against Islamic terror supporters."
"It's truly disgusting.

Like a game of whack a mole. People who can say the most abhorrent things get top billing on right leaning networks"
"She is emanating too much hate.

We have been there / done that with one term disgraced former President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice).__"
"I am not sure where you are in GA, but where I am is mouth breather trumpanzee central. Though you are not wrong !!"
Yippee! Thank goodness!
"Or ""grease"", as in contributions."
It pushes desantis to say the same and gives it cover
"I think less so tokenism and moreso passing.  She ""benefits"" from within the GOP by being light-skinned, straight-haired, having a middle name that sounds ""American"" and a last name that is ""American"".  As soon as primary season comes and Trump refers to her as her given birth name ""Nimrata Randhawa"" she's toast among the GOP base..."
So sorry to hear.
"My point is, she likely would have been nothing but a state-house back-bencher were it not for her opportunistic exploitation of her heritage- she’s really not that smart or talented. And she’s never going to win the presidential primary or even be chosen for vp- instead, she will humiliate herself and be forgotten or become a punchline."
100% agreed
This is terrifying 😢
"Over and over again? Private individuals and numerous groups have filed lawsuits to protect voting rights. 

>*For decades, private individuals and groups, who did not represent the federal government, have filed the majority of Section 2 lawsuits that have stopped state and local governments from minimizing the political power of people of color through the redrawing of voting maps and other steps in the elections process. But that longstanding practice may be coming to an end.*

Why are private individuals not being allowed to protest and sue to fight for their rights like anyone else?

*""It keeps me up at night,"" says Doug Spencer, an associate professor of law at the University of Colorado, who tracks voting rights lawsuits and is concerned about the argument not to allow private individuals to sue under Section 2. ""If that process is taken off the table, then the protection of minority voting rights will be much weaker after that case than it was before,"" Spencer adds. ""This is one important thread that could unravel what remains of the Voting Rights Act.""*

One piece at a time? Voting rights are being destroyed all across America.

>*In the lawsuit, groups representing Black voters in Arkansas claim that Republican politicians on Arkansas' apportionment board had drawn a map of state House districts that dilutes the voting power of Black people, denying Black communities meaningful opportunities to elect representatives of their choice.*

Why is  SPOTUS seemingly supporting the dismanyling of viter rights?

>*Pam Karlan - a professor at Stanford University Law School who, before stepping down last year, helped lead the department's Civil Rights Division as the principal deputy assistant attorney general appointed by President Biden - says beyond limited resources, there's also the challenge of the ""sheer volume of jurisdictions in the United States that might face a Section 2 case.# ""There are states, counties, school boards, water districts, city councils. I mean, there are just so many different governmental bodies that are subject to Section 2 that the idea that you'd have one body in the Justice Department as the sole enforcement mechanism makes no sense at all,"" says Karlan, who declined to comment on why the DOJ decided not to take on the Arkansas case.*

How many districts (that have been redrawn) will need to file law suits to ensure their voting rights are protected?

And why deny the individuals (whose rights are being destroyed) the ability to pursue legal remedies to retain their voting rights?

>*""I think it's an open question only in the sense that no court has ever felt compelled to expressly say that people whose voting rights have been violated can sue under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act because everyone - and I do mean everyone - understood that that's what Congress meant,"" says Dan Tokaji, dean of the University of Wisconsin Law School, who has written about private individuals suing for violations of federal election laws.*

If we don't stand up now? And fight for the voting rights of all of us? Then they will be lost for all of us.

>*If the Arkansas lawsuit ultimately reaches the U.S. Supreme Court, it may join a list of cases that have resulted in a steady chipping away of Voting Rights Act protections by the conservative-majority court under Chief Justice John Roberts.*

And that's sad for Arkansas and America."
"Very much so.

I'll be paying close attention to the hearings."
"Desantis would love this. The illegal immigrants that work the farms here in Florida are severely abused. Sometimes never paid, under paid, homeless and no education for kids. The next time you pour a glass of orange juice, eat strawberries or other veggies grown here in the sunshine state please think of the people who picked it."

if there are no longer (really) any truancy officers - and (supposedly) not enough people in the DoL or the DoE to track children and/or make sure they are not being used - if there is no dis-incentive to do otherwise - what do you think employers are gonna do if they can get away with it for more net profit?????        
unbridled capitalistic greed - yeh!!!"
Pray for the children.
Illegal immigration causes a caste system and open borders is non-sustainable with our entitlements structured the way they are.

"There are a lot of us who are supporting you, just like we have supported gay right for years. We have LBQIA friends, and we love you all."
Just hang on and transition when you turn 18.
"nearly 50 year old cis homeowner/business owner, married old geezer and game player here. 

I mention all this to let you know that there are many of us from my generation that support all of you. And I mention the gaming bit, because I see more and more acceptance in the younger crowds and young people I game with every day. 

More young people are politically motivated and are aware these days on how important it is to vote to protect people.

I know things are bad now - I am hoping that this is the thrashing and crying of a dying beast. It is going to get harder before it gets better. 

I hate that for all of you, that just want to be happy. All you want is what this nation has promised for the last 250 years. 

When I was young - there were no transgender kids. It wasn't talked about. None of you had a voice. 

And now you do. 

Yes there are people trying to shut you up - but you have a voice and I think that is progress. 

Keep your hopes up. Keep your chin up. And most importantly - VOTE. 

Vote progressive like your life depends on it. Because it just might one day. 

Get your friends to vote. Vote so hard and so much that they can't fudge the numbers. It it the most important thing all of you can do for your future"
"Looking at the history of your comments, you come across as someone being paid to participate in social media, to me. I don't trust this."
"You are not alone. There is a huge and growing community of people who support you and want you to have absolutely the best life possible. The current political environment is absolutely toxic for kids like you. I understand that and totally get why you would be terrified.   


I'm not trans. But I grew up in Texas in the 80s as a gay kid. I get it. And because I get it, I promise to have your back. And I'm not alone.   


It gets better. Oh, does it ever get better. <3"
All of us in the LGBTQ+ community are so that's why we FIGHT LIKE HELL!
Look around. People will support you. Just say your lines and do your script.
"I’m sorry my friend. If you ever need anything when you’re in Minneapolis, message me."
"I completely understand you're scared. I am a gay man, and when I was a teenager like you many years ago (I am probably more than twice your age) I had the same feelings. All you can do is have hope. There are a lot of us out here fighting for LGBTQIA rights. Try to hang in there, and don't let these people make you hate yourself. I believe we will win in the end!"
"I'm really sorry to read about stories like these. I feel kind of bad for ever letting myself think that this stuff was mostly behind us. 

I'm a fairly basic gay male, but I don't want anyone to go through what I went through in my youth as I was isolated and confused. My family was actually pretty supportive, but I took a long time to even come out to myself."
"I’m a straight white woman so obviously I can’t comprehend what you have and will go through, but I’m an ally and also I have known quite a few trans people here in Portland, Oregon. I am a physician who did a fellowship at OHSU here and I saw many gender reassignment surgeries done here as well. I had a trans medical student even. Maybe a good place."
"Ya its crazy that my friend is ignoring job offers in Texas because of laws there and 17 year old is in transition process. 

Still I couldn't have predicted the sea-change America had in the last 2 decades to acknowledge LGBTQ+ human dignity and rights.  There's always going to be some kinds of bigotry, racism, varieties of hate in human history, so these recent laws are simply the pushback because real progress was made.  Progress isn't slowing down, your generation isn't putting up with the repressive laws and it looks like they are actually showing up to vote.  So in context of the last 50+ years of heteronormative white-supremacy, we are living in golden days that keep getting better.  Just requires constant vigilance, calling out intolerance even when its not personally affecting you."
"I have a trans friend of over 40 years that still lives in our native hard-right Indiana. I left in 2007.

This elder has your back. 🏳️‍⚧️
Vote.
Got to get everyone out to vote!
Sweetheart there is a whole horde of us here to support you. I do what I can. I talk to the kids about the importance of acceptance and inclusion. I’m so sorry you are afraid. If I could walk beside you every step of the way and help fight your battles I would. Let us know how we can help other than fight the good fight politically. Seriously. Be specific. I’m sure if you said the word an army of supporters would show up at a rally just to support you.
"Grab every person you know and beg, plead, drag them to vote. THIS YEAR. EVERY YEAR. Had to report a poster who suggested a Tran person set themselves on fire. That person shows up at EVERY election. At least do the same."
I hope you live in a safe place and have people around you who love you!  It isn't fair the GOP wages these culture wars that hurt so many people!
"As bad as it is today, it was far worse a generation or two back...Keep the level of acceptance moving upward and we can all be okay."
As long as Democrats are in control you're safe to be who you want to be. To each their own.
Conservatives claim they are for “freedom”.  But the facts are that they want to control others lives and roll society back to the 1950s.  Stay strong.
Maybe find something else to obsess over.
I don’t believe any of this.

you are still a not of legal age to transition. Give yourself sometime to think this through. I realized by giving myself time i would have avoided many things that can permantaly change my life for the worst.
"There's always resistance to things moving the right way, but they still move the right way. I remember the military going from prosecuting gay soldiers, to allowing them if they stay quiet about it, to fully allowing them period. I never even thought the first step would happen."
"I’m a conservative, from one of the reddest states in the US, and I don’t care what you do. As far as I’m concerned, you have just as much of a right to a happy life full of joy as I do. If I saw you in the street and you told me the same thing, I would say “ok, good for you. As long as you’re happy.” I would support you as I would support anybody’s right to do with their life as they choose. The problem is, a certain group of people want you to believe conservatives, like myself, are out to get you. That’s not true. The sooner you stop listening to the noise, the happier you’ll be. Don’t believe me? Want to see who the angry ones really are? Just watch the replies I get for this comment. Not sure why this post showed up in my feed, but as a conservative, I hoped to settle your unwarranted fears a little. Have a good day and I hope things are good for you in the future."
I'm planning on medically transitioning later but I definitely want to socially transition soon. I'm hoping I can go do the more medical stuff like hormones to hopefully get my voice deeper soon enough
They come across as a person who's whole life is their trans-ness (idk know else to word that. No offense intended) which is understandable considering they are young and living in a political climate that is also obsessed with it.
"I also looked briefly at his post history.  I would say that while I definitely understand the stress and depression that could probably arise from living in this time, I’d also advise him/them to wait until he’s closer to 18 before starting surgery and hormone treatment. 

As much as they say it’s settled science, it’s really not. Taking mass amounts of hormone pills can cause cancer, heart disease and shorten one’s life overall. There’s also the risk of anhedonia. 

I get that you are in pain and I feel terrible for this group that is being used as a political wedge when it’s probably hard enough to just live life in what feels like the wrong body. 

But try to separate the wheat from the chafe on this one. As much as the republican and conservative hatred of this protected group is disgusting, changing your body at such a young age is still an unknown variable."

Let's not give kids false hope about states with Republican state legislature majorities.
What makes you think Democrats are in control?
"This is dangerously untrue. Republicans control dozens of state governments, often with supermajorities. Telling people to act like that isn’t the case is setting people up for failure."
"I have a son in his early twenties, who just started his hormone therapy last year. I wish you all the luck in the world. It sounds like both of your parents are supportive, which is a great asset.

I understand your fears about government intervention in your life, and you have reason for concern. Try to remember that who you are is immutable, no matter what the government says. I would also say that if you are in the sort of state that is in danger of adopting regressive policies about gender, especially with the support of your parents, moving may be an option. Even at a national level, if things got really bad, I'd say that being yourself is more important than being an American."
As a liberal I'm sorry but I can't support a child doing this to themselves I genuinely believe with all sincerity that a child does not have the capacity to understand the weight of mutilating their bodies in such a drastic and permanent way. I'm not against transgender*ADULTS* but I know how stupid I was as a child and it's just not right. Im not trying to be hateful here just putting in my two cents have a great day
"I mean, I created this account specifically to vent and talk about trans issues since I can't irl"
"I know, I'm planning to socially transition then medically transition when I get older. Though I'm tempted to just try to transition sooner, I can't stand looking or sounding like a girl."
"Agreed, it could just be a flurry of interest in online groups to find like-minded people, and I hope they are not suffering. But I'm also a little paranoid and something just didn't sit right with me seeing all those posts."
This comment needs more upvotes.
Potus and senate
Also…the Supreme Court and federal courts are currently filled with conservatives
"If you use the word “mutilation”, then a) i highly doubt you’re a liberal, and b) i highly doubt you’re actually a trans ally in any capacity. 

If I’m incorrect, allow me to educate you a little. For starters, children aren’t getting any sort of “mutilation” surgeries. They just aren’t. Regardless of whether that’s our business, anyway, it’s a non issue. The most common form of gender affirming care for children is social transitioning, where they do things like change their attire, take on a different name, assume different pronouns, get a different haircut, etc. That’s generally done before anything else at all. It’s a good way to test out and ensure they feel as comfortable in that new identity as they think they will.

The second step can be puberty blockers, which the effects, if you stop taking them, are almost always reversible. Normal puberty commences and everything adjusts as it would in any other child. 

In some extreme cases, the next step is hormonal treatment, where they start on the hormone that they want to transition to. However, this is never the first step, and there is always plenty of time to back out and “decide” if this is right for them. 

So stop using the word “mutilation”… at all. Those surgeries are legitimate gender affirming care and shouldn’t be called that in the first place, but additionally, it’s just not happening to children."
"As a liberal, I can say with 100 certainty that you do NOT understand transitioning."
"""I'm not against trans adults, I just think they're drastically and permanently mutilated""

Sure, bud"
"As a liberal I’m sorry but I don’t care what your opinion is about someone else’s choices.  I’m sorry it makes you feel icky, but please kindly keep your opinions to yourself.  It’s not your place to criticize, and you’re functionally identical to a trump supporter in this moment.  Hope this helps!"
I agree with you. Children need to be protected.
That sounds extremely rational. I wish you the best of luck with everything. Truly. I can’t imagine how difficult it must be to look in the mirror and see a different reflection then what you feel like.
"Thanks, I'm not suffering too badly right now as my family is eventually planning on letting me atleast socially transition soon (cutting my hair, going by a different name and pronouns, etc.)"
Nowhere near enough to be in control.
Nonsense! All of us on Reddit are here to express our opinions. If you think people should be silenced then you’re as bad as DeSantis.
That's just great. 😕

Trump's trip to Ohio was nothing more than his entire M.O.: A commercial for how great he is. -And Faux Nooz played it up. (at least he didn't throw any paper towels at them.)
"As POTUS, Biden's surpassed my expectations.  They were low, but come on.  Who's WOULDN'T be low after Trump got elected?  🤷‍♂️"
“But… but… Trump flew to Ohio and then he took some people to McDonalds and handed out feee hats.” -village idiot.
Polls. Mean. Nothing.
"Biden is the current president, his standing is relevant to me. Trump is nobody, why are we still keeping tabs of his standing, unless anyone believe he has a snowballs chance in hell of winning in 2024?"
His literal standing isn’t so good after his walk up the stairs the other day ;)
I think it's worth following. Trump sliding in polls still has implications. It could mean that a more moderate Republican ends up winning the primary and actually ends up challenging Democrats.
"I think Biden should retire. He is getting to the point where his age could spoil the election. All it takes is one bad event, and Republicans win. I hate to sound ageist, and I truly think Biden has done a fantastic job in an office, but politics is a nasty game. It's all about winning at any cost, and our fundamental rights and freedoms are at stake.

Also, I am fully confident that, if given the chance, the party can coalesce around a young candidate with new and progressive ideas. Nobody was talking about Obama in early 2006, but then look what happened."
That's great. Tell the news media to stop covering him.
"He still has a big following and it doesn't matter if he doesn't gain any votes. If he's the presidential nominee for the GOP all it takes is for democrats to not show up to vote for him to win.

I don't understand how people don't understand how he's still a threat"
"People need to start ignoring MTG, not posting her absurd, publicity-seeking garbage statements. She's trying to gain recognition as Trump did, by outrageous blather."
I think we all thought this in 2016 though
It would be nice if we could just ignore him and he would just go away like the monster under bed but that’s not gonna happen. Hopefully a Big Mac or a bucket or KFC will make him go away.
"Lets say that the Vegas odds matter more than actual polls, since those betting odds are literally people putting their money where there mouth is.

According to Vegas odds at this exact moment both Trump and DeSantis have better odds than Biden.

So yea I'd say Trump still matters."
"The fact that he still occupies so much head space in so many people still boggles my mind. Can we let the dude fade away already, over it."
Amen. If we’d only been allowed to ignore his grift in 2015 we’d have been better off.
"thats a fair point that Trumps fan base is as big as it can get in fact its only going to get smaller as older Republicans die out and young people become 18 (young people being more likely to be liberal and old people being more likely conservative) unfortunately the republican party needs trumps zealots in order to just remain on the surface if they lost them their support would be so small the democrats would start skipping away with national level elections, which is why media especially right wing media won't shut up whenever he farts"
Research will indicate otherwise.
Free wall-to-wall news coverage every time he cuts a fart. He’s a goddamn media ecosystem. And they’re gonna shove him down our throats and up our asses until he’s dead.
"Ok sounds good, thanks"
You'll eat these words. Sounds like wishful thinking to me. Trump is like a hemorrhoid that never goes away.
"I am over 18 and voted for Trump in 2020. I think the country would have been better off than it was with Biden.

If anyone would like me to go into detail, I can. Any subject I can tell you, as an independent, I was impressed with him (though I will admit I don’t get my news from MSNBC or Fox… I watch biased sources from the left and right so I know what the source prefers, and don’t rush to judgement easily)."
"Where did you get your data from? Trump supporters are like zealots, they don’t waver. Unfortunately, my best friend is one and I know firsthand."
We were all saying that in 2016.  He’s an idiot. Ignore him. Focus on the real possible candidates and the threats they pose.
"OP.  Serious question.  Why do you even bring him up?   You're literally making people pay attention to him.    Like the South Park joke on Harry and Megan... ""We Want Our Privacy"" World Tour.  

That's you with Trump.  Waving a big ol' Trump sign around.  Why?"
If trump didn’t matter you wouldn’t be making a post about him .
"71 million people voted for him in 2020 and if they did it then, they'll do it again. Every last one."
"Trump is their money maker. Trump gets them clicks and eyeballs. They will never stop covering him. This goes for all news networks liberal, conservative, whatever."
"Right, like the person who posted."
I agree.  71 million voted for POS.  What's scary is how many more million that didn't vote think like he does.
"Yeah but even Republicans are giving her side eye these days. Ranting about Jewish space lasers is a bad look. It's not like Republicans will ever hold their side accountable, though."
"And 2020, I couldn't imagine how anybody who didn't vote for him in 2016 would in 2020. Plenty of places where he gained vote share and he received millions more total votes."
My point is totally different from this argument.
"This is what GOP leaders are saying privately as well, reportedly."
Because he’s fat and unhealthy! Am I right? I get it! We should fat shame him!
">Vegas odds at this exact moment both Trump and DeSantis have better odds than Biden.

Most recent I can find is [here.](https://www.empirestakes.com/ny-sports-betting/presidential-election-odds) 

1️⃣  Joe Biden	+300	28.6%↑  
2️⃣  Donald Trump	+400	23.1% ↑  
3️⃣  Ron DeSantis	+275	22.2% ↓  
4️⃣  Nikki Haley	+1600	5.9%↑

I do agree with you that what Trump does still matters, as he is shooting himself in the face constantly, and he faces multiple lawsuits and investigations. That's all still news."
We can get over it when fewer than 71 million people decide to vote for him.
I'm not saying he doesn't have his own voter base. What I'm saying is every voter already knows whether they're going to vote for him or against him. All these stories about him and what he does doesn't change the number of people that are going to vote for him.
"As a foreigner looking in, I have to ask, how can you stomach voting for this embarrassing little gobshite? He is a joke."
How do you deal with your best friend bring a trump supporter.
"If he gets primaried next year, then they will stop talking about him."
"Yeah but DeSantis voters would vote Trump if Trump was the choice, and visa versa."
"Uhmmm so you’ll never be over it? I get what you meant by the comment bud but take my advice, you’ll be a lot happier when you stop worrying about what everyone else is doing and just focus on you and now. Don’t worry about some guy who is literally at the end of his life and is probably no where near ever being elected president again. Have a beer, take in the sun/ or rain. You got this!"
"Biden and Trump are jokes, in my opinion. But I looked at the policies and I picked Trump. And I don’t regret it, if I’m honest. In 2016, I was worried about WW3, but with no ears and foreign affairs actually going surprisingly well with a big peace treaty in the Middle East and no new wars, I was delightfully surprised.

I’m anti-war, and I think Ukraine is a corrupt country, cutting off water to Crimea, and I don’t like Russia either. I don’t get a support for war on either side. Biden can’t clean our house at home. This chemical disaster in Ohio, for example, I think Trump handled it better than Biden or his team.

Call him names all you want to, but it doesn’t help anyone have a civil conversation."
We agreed to never talk about politics
"Trump voters wouldn't. That's the tiger the GOP is riding. 

That's why even now, the GOP officials are trying to get Trump to say publicly that should he not win the primary, he'll support the GOP candidate, and <shocker> he won't say that.

Trump will claim DeSantis (or whomever)  cheated, and would run 3rd party.

In 2016, Trump lost the Iowa Caucus to Ted Cruz of all people, and he said Ted Cruz cheated."
"Oh, believe me, I don't think there's a chance in hell that he could get elected, and I am hoping that he continues to destroy the GOP, so I'm not at all ""worrying"" about that. I'm just saying there are a lot of really fucking stupid people in this country to fall so hard for an obvious grifter, even after he sold them virtual trading cards and handed out campaign hats to people who had just suffered an unspeakable environmental tragedy in their backyard."
You're situation is more proof that he cannot gain a single vote regardless of what he does. This is my point.
Just taking a leaf from the Orange one’s book. I think gobshite sums him up perfectly. Every time he opens his mouth incoherent rambling lies and exaggerations spew forth. He is everything I abhor in a human.
"Of course! It’ll keep happening too. Those who follow political figures regardless of who they are and solely by party line can’t be convinced, and those who don’t, don’t need convincing."
/r/igotminesofuckeveryoneelse.
I hope people are wising up... The level of their delusion is beyond belief
Insurrectionists have no credibility.
So why’d you vote them in 🤦‍♂️
Gasp! Ya dont say!
Not sure it’s delusion so much as manipulating the rubes for the moneyed class.
The 'delusion' is largely among the electorate
who
"To sell books, that’s all. No one in their right would vote for her."
Yawn. She may actually get fewer votes than Kanye.
Is she gonna seek the Republican nomination too?
"I am not bothered by this. She was definitely the least qualified and craziest person on the stage last time, but even she managed some coherent and salient points. The person most seen as the most unqualified on the Democratic side is still better than Ted Cruz and leagues ahead of the MTG, Boebert ,Gosar caucus. She didn't go anywhere last time, and will do even less this time."
Orb mother
She wants a fox news job.  That's it.  That's why she's doing this.  She'll hit all the Republican talking points and try to poison the well.  Maybe she'll even announce Sinema as her running mate.
Who?
"I like Marianne, and I don’t think she deserves the ridicule she gets. That said, the democrats don’t need someone splitting the ticket if Biden decides to run again."
Sacrificial opposition so we feel good there is a primary.
"Fool me once, ok she didn't fool me last time.  I gave her half an hour of my attention and realized she was certifiable.   But still, Marianne, just stay home, it's not gonna happen for you."
She just a Trumpy MAGA Qanon Cult member and everyone knows it sitting with Gen Qanon and Putin tells you all you need to know about this attention seeking drama queen.  This weekend speaking at the Capitol for the RePUTINlicans along with Fox “News” Tulsi .  Never gonna let that happen again.
I can’t believe they haven’t surfaced anyone to take the job.
Joe Biden would have to be insane not to step aside and let a younger person take the stage. I’m 100% voting for her.
"Good. Let's face it, the man has the mental acuity of a radish."
Don't blink.
She’s so annoying
For-Profit politics is an embarrassment too humanity.
I'm sure both of her supporters are excited.
lmao
I swear I despise this lady!
I'm going to check into her. I'm not voting for Biden again.
Again?  Are the three people who voted for her last time still interested?
Let’s go baby! I think she comes off as genuine. Which is better than most.
Omg this is a joke campaign…
Nothing in MSM. Sounds like The Hill trying to cause conflict on the left as they love to do.
Afrojack.
I feel like this is almost everyone's reaction when they read this.
"Nobody in their right minds would vote for Donald Trump or Ron DeSantis either, so there’s that."
"hey, second place isn't too bad..."
"But they like MTG for some reason. 

Can we get like a psychologist and a sociologist to explain this phenomenon please?"
"You're thinking tulsi, who's a good friend of putins. Maryanne is the crystals and strange energies woman."
"Actually she’s pretty far to the left, never a fox’er.   However this strikes me as an ego trip that will generate attention but go nowhere."
Why? He's doing a good job.
"I'm assuming you are joking, but the woman IS at 70, no millennial herself."
"Fair point with criticism towards The Hill in that regard. I'm a bit neutral with The Hill.

However for MSM, Fox News - as well as Yahoo, Business Insider and New York Post have all confirmed Marianne Williamson will be challenging Joe Biden. 

Also very recent Marianne's twitter feed heavily suggests she'll be challenging Joe Biden, announcement March 4th."
"But her spirit is young, she frequently renews it with crystal energy and pyramid power.  🤡"
"Any Democrat has a challenge since they have to win by a larger margin than Republicans and corporate media plays bothsideism softening the right-wing crazy train and playing up progressives as a similar extreme on the left. So, the election will always be razor thin no matter what, even if Trump wins the primary."
"Then start volunteering now. Turn your worry into action. DeSantis is an odd duck, so help define him early."
"Eh, the first step is realizing that it's not just DeSantis, but anybody who makes it out of the GOP Primary with the nomination will be like this. Likewise, for all the weaknesses Biden has, incumbency is one of the strongest political strengths out there. Focusing on the individual characters is what the opposition wants you to do, when in reality, it's vote Blue, no matter who."
"Desantis crumbles at any kind of debate. He falls apart when confronted by people so this makes him look extremely weak. Middle ground voters would not vote for someone willing to strip the rights away from them especially nationally. Some states would vote for him but I doubt enough states would to give him the presidency. We've seen him yell at kids and things like banning books. The ""woke war"" as he calls it is great for his state but nationally that will not work. Also restricting women's rights bit every Republican in the ass this midterm so it's definitely gonna come back harder in 2024 for the presidential race. If Republicans allow the US to default the entire nation (which is UNCONSTITUTIONAL btw) it will cause a huge revolt against Republicans as it will screw our economy for decades, hurt regular and rich citizens and cause inflation which they have been calling for being brought under control to skyrocket."
"If Trump doesn't get the nomination, it would be ideal if he ran as a 3rd party candidate and took along his wackos, dividing the party and making it easier for Biden to win."
"So many repubs are still trump supporters, don't know if they would vote for desantis. Of course they wouldn't vote for a dem either. Maybe they just won't vote?"
But that is assuming trump bows out gracefully and doesn’t explode the party with his hissy fit when he loses.
It’s irrelevant because WHEN not if Trump runs as a third party he is going to split the Republican vote making it impossible for them to win the election.
"Best we can hope for is DeSantis wins the GOP Nom then we all help divide and conquer. Split them between Trump and DeSantis.  A few, but just enough, will NEVER leave Trump.  Let’s keep it that way.  Every chance we get we split DeSantis vs Trump.  Conservatives don’t turn on a dime.  They dig in.  2 camps of them and we win."
"Honestly, DeSantis is such a terrible communicator and public speaker that once he is on the nationsl stage he will not be generally accepted by the country like he is in Florida; the real risk is--yet again--another Trump v Biden ticket."
Kinda just depending on D.Sans and Big Orange to split the vote sufficiently with cat fighting so grandpa can win.
 They didn’t have the votes in 2020 they won’t have them in 2024.
"DeSantis has a record, not just bombast. That actually makes him easier to defeat."
"DeSantis will not be able to translate his Florida fascism and popularity outside of that state.
Biden will only get more popular as we see the benefits of sound leadership."
"As a Floridian, this is my nightmare."
"My hope is that if someone other than Trump wins the primary, Trump will run as an independent and split the vote."
"Dems need to find someone younger who will be more electable. I like Biden, but he already has a lot of baggage and he is no spring chicken."
Republicans consistently lose the popular vote in modern presidential elections. I don't see DeSantis' policies changing this in any way. It's just a matter of the Electoral College which I have no idea how to overcome
"I’ve been kinda under the guise that even though Biden has an approval rating sub 13%, and Democrats want someone else to lead the party, Democrats will still vote Biden if it is him vs. the Republican nominee. We can not want an 80 year old man running as our nominee at the same time as voting the democratic nominee regardless of who it is. I think we can all agree that in the political scene right now, another Presidential win for Republicans is an end to democracy in the USA and the beginning of a true oligarchal dictatorship + fascism."
"Personally, I don't think DeSantis stands a chance with such a divided republican base. And I don't think Trump has enough support to beat Biden."
The best case scenario for dems in 24 is a desantis ticket because trump will run third party to punish republicans. He will siphon off millions of votes in a world where he lost by 7 million last time anyway. Republicans are fucked.
"Don't worry...If Trump is the nominee, Biden beats Trump **again**.  


If Trump is **not** the GOP nominee, his ego will require him to run third party, effectively kneecapping any other GOP nominee. It's the only good reason to be patient over the prosecutions that should put Trump in prison. Trump **not behind bars** leaves him free to f\*\*k up their sh\*t.  


Go Trump/Lake 2024 - The Suicide Vest Party"
"If some gerrymandering had gone differently, we probably would still have the house. Namely, we lost seats in NY because their map was overturned and, in my home state of OH, we could have actually gained a couple seats had the Republicans in this state not gotten away with an illegal map. So while the midterms were disparaging, there was no red wave, and we narrowly lost the house because of the gerrymandering. 

While I understand your concern about DeSanctimonious, I don’t think he has national appeal. He is too extreme for the independent voters. Also, assuming he even enters the race, it’s going to be a long and bitter primary election because of Trump. They will be slinging mud at each other, and you can fully expect a divided Republican Party at the end of it all. Polls that place Biden and DeSanctimonious in a head to head show DeSanctimonious winning, but those polls are worthless when the campaign hasn’t even started, there have been no debates, and the polls haven’t been conducted in key battleground states."
"I don’t want to count my chickens before they hatch, but DeSantis is 0% charming and his biggest sell is owning the Libs. Florida is not the whole country and he’d have to come up with actual ideas to win."
WE THOUGHT TRUMP WAS A SURE THING UNTIL HE LOST. Put that same passion into the next election and FUCKING GET YOUR FRIENDS AND GEN Z TO VOTE!
"Nah, people see what a fascist as whole DeSantis is, Biden is doing a good job as president."
"Personally, I don't think Deathantis is going to run in 2024. I think he will wait till 2028..."
"It's good to be concerned. However, there's no need to build the DeSantis myth. He's a whiny little schlub that won't attract people to his sideshow the way Trump does. Best we can hope is that Trump and DeStantis fight it out in Florida, leaving each other battered and their constituencies conflicted. There is a certain percentage of the Trump faithful that won't be converted to DeSantis. What that percentage is, we don't know yet."
"I'm sort of in the same camp. I remember how aged Bill Nelson didn't have enough fight in him in his race against Rick Scott and lost.

Personally, I think California Governor Gavin Newsome would be a better match against DeSantis. He's not afraid to go toe-to-toe with DeSantis and won't have any problem making DeSantis look like a fool!"
"Keep in mind, the incumbent president always has an advantage over their challenger. DeSantis would be wise to let Trump lose again to Biden. I think a lot of folks--not just Democrats--are sick of Trump's election lies. Every time Trump claims the election was stolen he looks weak because he is clearly powerless to change anything. Nikky H. will split the field if DeSantis runs and she will end up being offered Vice President from Trump. I honestly think this is her true angle and it's fucking pathetic. She will knee-cap DeSantis; run for vice president; elevate her image for a 2028 run. But who knows 🤷....."
"If Biden wants to prove he isn’t as insane as Trump or DeSantis, he won’t run a second time. He’s going to let a young person take the stage against these crazy a-holes."
"Not super worried about DeSantis as he is not a cult figure the way Trump was.  And Trump had a TV show that made him seem like he knew what he was doing (although that just turned out to be editing).  If Trump and DeSantis both run , they’ll split the Republican vote and Trump is too much of an egomaniac to quit"
Honestly I worry more about Trump. I don’t think Desantis would beat Trump in the primaries to be able to actually run against Biden. Trump people are crazy loyal to him and many people who voted for Biden over Trump are middle of the road people who a lot have been upset about the economy and inflation. I’ve seen friends who I never thought in a million years would be supportive of Trump starting to show favoritism towards him.
"I think DeSantis will win as well. It’s horrible. He focuses on things that make no difference but make big headlines. Florida is bursting with homelessness, drugs, and poverty, but he is bullying librarians.  He’s revamping colleges, when his kids won’t go to a Florida college (Ivy League all the way). He is actual smart person like his lowlife brother, Ted Cruz, and spouts his bullshit for votes. There’s nothing real there except his quest for power."
I think you are right.
"I read an article today comparing DeSantis to Jesse Helms from the early 80s. Showing that like Helms, DeSantis is unlikely to get the nomination because of how extreme he is. Helms for instance, was also discriminatory against LGBTQ people, such as trying to get gay people barred from becoming school teachers. Obviously the label LGBTQ didn't exist yet but hatred for them was just as strong. 

The country as a whole is much more accepting than it was back in the 80s. If Helms couldn't get a foot hold, maybe there is hope that DeSantis won't be able to either."
"As a someone who lives in FL, when the rest of Murica meets DeathSantis and see how he really is I don’t think they will like him."
Speaking as a non party perspective im not sure desantis makes it out alive of the primary.
"I am hoping that Biden is not going to run. He did not intend to, and he will be tired and old. We should be looking for an Obama candidate. Someone qualified ofc, but ideally young and smart, and I'm willing to lean hard into ""young and smart"" for the right person."
"I’m hoping DeSantis and Trump will take each other down. I wish there were a stronger democratic candidate. Biden is not popular, even among many democrats and he is looking frail."
"DeSantis is burying himself with constricting Floridians’ constitutional rights. He thinks he’s doing something noble but he’s breaking his constituents. I expect to see a mass exodus from Florida at the end of the school year and a severe drop in university registrations for next year. When the kids leave their money making, tax paying parents go with them. This will be a melt down of a cancellation for Florida. 

The state can’t survive being run by militia-minded, meth-head, trailer trash."
"It’s very worrying. Please learn about ways you can help get out the vote. www.vote411.org is a good website from the League of Women voters. Please share. If you would like help finding a meaningful volunteer opportunity, let me know and I’ll help. If not, just keep talking up voting to your like minded friends and family."
"I love you, Joe. Please don't run again."
Let's see how he does in Republican primary. DeSantis comes off as a Jeb! To me.
"No you can’t borrow my weapons and rations when your president gets us in a combination civil / world war. It’s time to forget the divisive 2 party system. If you truly think one person in the American government has that much power, you are my enemy."
"De Santis is almost like an Adolf Hitler. He is a fascist and people also adore him and admire him. Yes, Biden would lose to De Santis. De Santis will be (unfortunately) our next President."
"You are right to be worried.

Biden beats trump again but he will indeed lose to desantis.

Let's hope trump is the nominee."
"""I'm really a Trump supporter trolling. Wanted to know liberals thoughts"""
Hey at least DeSantes is not Tr*mp
Apparently your party already lost if the incumbent drops out.  So D are likely running Biden if he can
"For about a year now I’ve been foreseeing a DeSantis 2024 win, unfortunately. I’m also in Florida. I hope to God that Trump or Cheney runs independent."
"I wouldn't worry about that.  The agism thing would certainly come to play, but fundamentally it all depends upon whether Trump would run as independent.  I don't know those odds, but they seem significantly high."
"I don't know if it'll even get to that point.

A lot of high ranking and well known democratics stay mum when asked if they will support a second term for Biden. No one will support a run for Harris.

Democrats need to work fast on getting a replacement and it seems they're courting Gavin Newsom, the Governor of California. I hate the guy. A lot of people don't like him here, but it's a ""vote blue no matter who"" situation that he's coasted on. You need more than that during a presidential run.

He's shmarmy, hypocritical, and has a car salesman feel to him. He vacillates based on public opinion--science, numbers and facts will always lose out here. He will tank in all traditional red states. He will flounder in blue states with a strong blue collar back bone. He may be too west coast for east coast liberals. However, some democrats are courting him for a potential run and it is a bad fucking idea. Newsom was already running ads against DeSantis during the summer of 2022, which confused a lot of Californians and, in the end, was made fun of for jumping the gun.

Biden won't make it to another election, I don't think the party will allow it, but I don't see anyone viable as of yet and election season is closing in fast."
Eye don’t think DeSanti’s will loose.
High chance.
"Is there a chance that Democrats would nominate someone else, not Biden?"
"If the election were today desantis would win 320 to 350 EV, and maybe close in the popular. I agree with the other commenters who said get involved now. Sign up people to vote now. Argue with people on social media so their voice is not the only one heard, getting burner accounts if your family or work can't know. Spread real news and good left memes. Memes are easy to read and tell a story than even idiots can understand."
Trump will destroy Desantis in the primaries. He still runs the GOP
"Lose.  The word is LOSE.

Loose means less tight."
Would Biden even run in 2024? There are other Dem options...
Because needs to promote his successes much better.
My mom as a conservative doesn’t like desantis. Feels he’s too far right...
"If DeSantis went further right, I don’t think that’d harm his popularity with today’s Republican Party at all, and that’s what scares me. If it comes down to being between him and Trump, I imagine it will only encourage both of them to see who is the most anti-everything and who can do the most to serve the interests of ultra-conservative and evangelical voters who want nothing more than to throw the country backwards a hundred years. 

So, in other words, I couldn’t agree more that people should absolutely be talking more about this possibility, because it’s becoming more and more apparent that that’s the exact direction the country is taking."
"Maybe my point is a litle unpopular, but the best chance for democrats in my opinion is to replace Biden and do a primary as well."
Bc trump will negotiate a pardon in exchange for dropping out.
Facts
Left wing extreme and right wing extreme are both crazy though
What do you mean democrats have to win by a larger margin?  In the presidential election it's the rules of the electoral college.
And be the Stacy Abrams of your own community!
"So, what are the most impactful things to do as a volunteer? A friend of mine suggested in the last race to “help do outreach phone calls” but I personally hate the amount of outreach that reaches me. 

What are other things that need done, in your opinion?"
💯
As the control freak he is..
"I agree, but I think Biden's the favorite. DeSantis has a nasally voice and says he's 5'7"". 

That will cost him a fraction of Trump's machomen and he needs 100%, if not more due to Boomers dying."
💙💙💙
I definitely plan on voting Democratic no matter who the nominee is.
The GOP increasingly refuses to host or participate in debates because of how their rhetoric comes across.
"About DeSantis being a terrible communicator, I've read this from several other people below. To be honest I haven't listened to him giving speeches of holding campaign events that much.

I think the powers-that-be at Fox are hyping him up because they think is more likely to win than Trump. But tt seems he is most well known for his high-profile fight with Disney, and flying immigrants to Martha's vineyard, rather than anything he has said.

It's completely possible that  I am worrying too much, or underestimating Biden (I've underestimated him before)."
"I've seen some people suggest that Trump is aware of that possibility and is using it as leverage to get the nomination; he'd basically be saying ""pick me or I'll make sure our team loses"" to the GOP"
"If that happens, they will do what daddy tells them to do, knowing what a revengeful bitch he is, he will make Rons life miserable. He possibly goes third party because he is delusional about his overall popularity."
"As much as this could be the likely scenario, I will not count on this happening. Republicans are smart enough to not tear each other apart in November."
"Also, let’s be honest. DeSantis is horrible and fascist, but I think he would be less destructive than Trump. I’m voting in the GOP primary for the most sane candidate possible but I may even vote for DeSantis (🤮) because 4 more years of Trump would be a catastrophe.

But you know what would be worse? Trump losing another general election. They would riot."
"This. For Republicans, DeSantis is great on paper, but as soon as he starts talking, he exudes a lot of Jeb Bush “please clap” energy. 

There’s zero chance Trump supporters will get excited about him (or at least, not nearly as excited as they are about Trump). 

I predict Trump will win the nomination again, because he has the Republican Party by the balls. He’s holding them hostage and will burn everything and everyone to the ground if he doesn’t get the nomination."
Did you ever actually listen to trump speak?  Republicans don’t care how terrible and moronic a candidate is. If Fox News says to vote for him. That’s all that matters.
"The question isn't whether Republicans vote but whether Democrats come out and vote, the latter can be harder to persuade to show up at the polls."
never underestimate the Christian nationalists. they won overturning roe v wade with 70% of all Americans disagreeing
"as an American, the mere fact that he can win is a nightmare. at least trumps little insurrection was unplanned and ill conceived.  De Santis is actually intelligent enough to make it happen"
Yes!!!
There needs to be an age limit. He's going to die in office if he wins another term.
"I agree. I will totally vote for Biden if he is the nominee, and I think most other Democrats will as well. My main concern is the tiny sliver of voters in swing states that can decide the outcome of the election."
"Trump would lose to Biden again. 

not sure we need Biden term 2, but he's exceeded my expectations for him. 

we need a younger more charismatic leader in 2024/ 28 to keep the WH."
"I also really like Newsom. He knows how to put up a fight, and to inspire people. I could see him running for President in 2028."
"Not that I’m necessarily disagreeing, but who do you think should run, in that case?"
"Thanks. Volunteering in politics has been something I've wanted to do for a while now. Although I'm not exactly the best at communicating with strangers, so I don't know how effective I would be doing things like canvassing."
"I didn't get that impression from OP's post. They even mention the good job Biden has done, and that Biden isn't getting enough credit.

And I agree. Biden wasn't my first pick, but he has done a good job steering us out of a crisis. And unlike his orange predecessor he is quiet about it, just getting the work done without boasting about it every few seconds. It has been refreshing."
"I swear to god I'm not a Trump supporter trolling. I'd be just fine with Biden winning a second term. I'm just worried that he isn't the best person to defeat a Republican. I could be wrong.

EDIT: I don't blame you for being suspicious btw. The amount of anti-Biden concern trolling is high"
"He’s worse.

Edit: In case anybody is wondering how DeSantis could possibly get elected look no farther than right here. There are a lot of Democrats that sit out elections because they don’t feel like voting is important and that the Republican candidate isn’t a threat to a normal way of life."
But the size of them and the outcomes from them are currently not equal
Do show us an example of left wing extreme in the U.S.
"Right, and because Democrats are concentrated in cities they can't afford to drop a single vote in rural areas or they'll lose. Meanwhile Republicans numbers can drop in rural areas and they still win. So, overall when Democrats are polling evenly with Republicans they will lose. Technically I guess it's polling margins I'm referring to."
Gerrymandering by the GOP
And the rules of the electoral college are what makes Democrats have to win by a larger margin.
"You need to make peace with the fact that we do have to contact people to remind them to vote. Believe it or not, most people aren’t signed up on campaign emails, etc. so the contact they get is minimal. 

You can sign up as a precinct chair in your county and volunteer to knock on doors, register voters, and yes, phone bank. Knocking on doors is one of the most effective ways to garner votes.

But if that makes you uncomfortable, there are several postcard and letter writing programs (Postcards to Swing States is one) and your county will likely have a series of text banks.

You can also volunteer in a more background way by organizing events, etc. Call your local Democratic Party and find out when they meet.

Be prepared to show up for a few meetings before anything starts to happen."
"Consider writing postcards! There are more of us than them, some people just need reminding/a gentle push."
"I have seen a few of his speeches and he just melts when confronted. He also yelled at children who were wearing masks near him and kinda bullied them into take them off during a press conference. Along with still hiding Covid death numbers, targeting a whistleblower who let the world know that he was hiding Covid numbers and under reporting by having her house raided and her computers seized along with many other things. 

So there's just a lot of ammo that can be used against him and his ""achievements"" are also turn offs for most of the middle ground undecided voters he would have to win over to have a chance. It's not impossible just very unlikely for Desatan to win even the primary as he has to go up against people who probably will have a cleaner look then him with all the things he is currently doing that are viewed by some as fascist."
Good point! There's nothing he loves more than having leverage over people!
"I never thought of it that way until now, but that is absolutely something that he seems like he'd be willing to do."
That's what I'm hoping for. Trump going third party will split the conservative vote and hand the Democrats an easy win.
Trump wants to be president again and he doesn’t care what anyone else wants and he still has enough loyal dumbasses that would vote for him that it will take electoral votes from the Republican states and make it easier for the Democrats to win.
"Don't discount Trump's vindictiveness. He isn't a Republican, he was just using them for his own benefit, and they were doing the same. If he doesn't get the nomination, they'll have to bribe him bigly to keep him out of the race as a 3rd party candidate. 

On the other hand, it's questionable if he can recruit anyone competent enough to file the papers properly."
Except they aren’t.
"no, no, no. DeSantis is far more dangerous than Trump. unlike Trump been in politics, knows the game. and is far more intelligent, meaning HIS INSURRECTION would likely succeed"
It’s like picking between a snake and scorpion.  Neither is a good option.  As long as neither idiot sits in the WH I’m ok.
"DeSantis is literally building an army in Florida. He's waaaay more dangerous than trump.  
  
He's young, and competent."
DeSantis would be much more destructive.
"Florida resident here, there are a ton of DeSantis and Disney-ized DeSantisland stickers on cars. A lot. Conservatives here love him."
"Trump was a reality TV star, and as sad as it is to say this, he has a kind of cheap game show charisma that helped propel his political career. DeSantis on the other hand is about as charismatic as a 2 pack of saltines."
"A bigger thing to wait on is to see if Trump runs as an independent. Despite him losing some followers he would absolutely demolish any chance the Republicans would have to swing those states I think because he would split the vote of the republican base. Whether the politicians want that or not, it’s what they’re gonna get when they made Trump an outlet for racists and bigots to throw their votes to without question"
"There are letter writing campaigns https://www.mobilize.us/mobilize/event/413655/ and postcard writing campaigns https://postcardstovoters.org/ , texting opportunities, voter ID assistance https://www.voteriders.org/.  Also contact your local Democratic or progressive party and get on their mailing lists. LMK if I can help further."
"Yes, he is much worse.  All these policies and laws in FL that DeSantis has pulled off is nothing that Trump could have done.  He’s insanely popular here in FL. Not sure how it’s playing nationwide."
"Love it, you don’t think it exists."
"This is a big issue in Los Angeles County, which is primarily Democrat. It's so ugly as they Gerrymander across **racial lines**. The issue most recently came up in Los Angeles during the last city council scandle late last year. 

That shit needs to stop **everywhere**, all around."
"Gerrymandering is a huge problem but it does not impact presidential elections.

Civics lesson time!  Electoral college is the paradigm used for presidential elections."
"This statement is misleading. In the electoral college system whichever party gets the greatest number of electoral college votes is the winner.

Democrats do not have to win by a greater margin of electoral college votes, all they need is one more electoral college vote than the republicans"
Knocking on doors is def the best way
I agreed with you on that. I just won't bet on them doing it. Republicans are 100% all in on trying to get all three branches or keeping enough power to obstruct.
Republican voters will fall in line and will vote against their own interests because they're scared of anything that's not Aryan. Throw in independent voters and I discount nothing.
"Well, fuck. Why can’t he just be normal?"
Can you provide an example?
"Human psychology time! Gerrymandering has the effect of dampening turnout because people hear 'its gerrymandered' and they don't stop and think: ""well this only affects House races, I'll still go an cast my vote for all the other races"". No, they hear its gerrymandered and think ""my vote doesn't count, I won't bother going"""
"Reality Time, Hillary Clinton had three million more votes than Trump."
"You're absolutely right. Gerrymandering impacts representation in the House, but it has no bearing on Presidential elections."
"Who ever has 270 electoral votes is who wins. Since there are 538 total votes, 270 is the least amount you can have and be in the majority. Unless a state (or DC) gets disqualified for some reason then the total number of votes are recalculated."
Are you talking the Republican Party or the voters?  Because the voters that support him are so blinded by Trump and the way he is that they won’t care if it sabotages the rest of the party especially if he tells his voters that all the people against him are RINOS
"95-98 percent of voters falling line is enough. 2% voting third party can sway the election. Elections in this country are won on the margins. Even if Trump runs again, Cheney will tun third party to fuck him. She gets 2-3 million votes and thats the whole ball game. I’m not too worried."
"dunno, but sadly he is gen X too. though I deny he belongs in Gen X. definitely acts more like a boomer"
https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2122593119
"You are completely correct about gerrmandering's negative effects! 

The original comment that I was replying to stated that democrats have to win presidential elections ""by a larger margin"" which I still maintain is misleading.

op clarified that they meant polls not actual votes, but that seems to be getting lost here."
I'm thinking 80/20 party more than voters. They've made it clear that they want power.
"The only person running third party would be Trump or maybe DeSantis. Everyone else in that party has no spine to run a third party at the expense of their political career. Cheney could, but she'll have been out of politics for too long."
">Ideology.

>Our primary predictor was a mutually exclusive categorical variable and included individuals who were identified as committed to Islamist, right-wing, or left-wing causes. Examples of groups supporting Islamist ideology included al-Qaeda and Hezbollah; examples of groups supporting right-wing ideology included the Ku Klux Klan and the National Alliance; and examples of groups supporting left-wing ideology included the Animal Liberation Front and the Weather Underground. Right-wing supporters represented 59%, left-wing 23%, and Islamist 18% of the sample. We created two dummy-coded variables with far-right ideology as the reference category.

Yep, the [Animal Liberation Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Liberation_Front) and the [Weather Underground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_Underground) are definitely big players in US liberal politics (I say this as a 'radical' environmentalist.)


>The findings from two studies, characterized by very different scopes and units of analysis, provide substantial support for conclusions about the relationship between ideology and the use of politically motivated violence. **First, data on extremists in the United States showed that left-wing radicals were less likely to use violence than right-wing and Islamist radicals**. Second, using worldwide data we found that in comparison to right-wing and Islamist groups, attacks motivated by left-wing groups were less deadly. These substantive conclusions were not affected by the inclusion of a set of control variables. Thus, the main findings appear to be robust across levels of analysis (i.e., individuals, groups) and geographical scope of the data.

>**Our results are in line with past research showing that conservative ideology—represented in our datasets by both right-wing and Islamist causes—is positively related to violent political behavior. These results support the view that left-wing and right-wing extremists are not equivalent when it comes to the use of violence** (48; see also [49] for related findings on the victims of hate crimes in the United States). Whereas our findings are not inconsistent with the idea that individuals espousing different ideologies may feel equally negative toward worldview-threatening others (50), they suggest that the social consequences of extreme right-wing hostility may be more harmful than those caused by the far left (see [50] for a similar point)."

"She already said if trump get the ticket, she’s running third party."
"To be fair, they struggle to define most words."
"Of course. What they want to attack is, ""anything we don't like."""
"I think the best description for what they mean by woke, was described by a TikToker who said calling someone woke is the modern day equivalent of calling someone an n-word -lover.  The tone is the same."
"It’s synonymous with “enlightened” or “educated”, the opposite of “ignorance”. Republicans needed to rebrand being educated and give it a negative connotation. They deliberately chose a slang term for “educated” that was commonly used in black culture. Since they are mostly racist being “woke” became something to avoid."
"Culture wars, they need their strawman to bully in defense of plastic Christian values."
"""Woke"" is how Republicans, and DeSantis is particular, disparage morality, empathy, and truth."
Woke is anything that suggests society is progressing.
It's just like CRT. They can't define it but they know it's bad.
"I guess ""fascism is bad"" is too direct for them."
"They struggle because they don’t understand that being “woke” is a virtue, not an affectation"
Sleepism is the opposite of wokeism. How dumb are they?
Imagine turning the language AAVE into a political attack. I miss when being woke was about black Americans learning their culture and history pre slavery. Now this has turned into something it’s not….
"They have their own vernacular consisting of triggering words that are meaningless. They only know that they don’t want to be those words. The only words they want to be associated with are “white,” “patriot,” and “christian.”"
"They don't need to define the boogeyman.   


They just need their followers to believe that it exists."
"Woke is being so aware of the oppression of minorities that you become racist in your efforts to be an ally. For example, a woke person would say that white people are the cause of systemic racism and therefore all white people are a problem. They are not judging people by the content of their character, but color of their skin. Wokism is basically the opposite of everything MLK espoused."
“Freedom from indoctrination?!!” There the ones who have been practicing religious indoctrination for the past 3 hundred years!
"Not a republican, but woke is the insufferable virtue signaling that Dems blast at everyone who won't conform 1000% to their way of thinking. Shouldn't be that hard to define in the liberal sub lol. Woke is Mayor Pete giving a speech on ending racism on construction sites while ignoring the train disaster in East Palestine, and it's hard to blame him when that's all the Twitter Dems care to focus on anyway. Plz don't ban me I like reading stuff here hahaha"
They beat a term into the dirt until it means nothing.
"They don't HAVE to, they just need to be on attack which means we're ALWAYS playing defense. Sick of it."
“woke” is used an all of the above slur when conservatives say it.
"The point is not to define it, so they can use it to attack anything."
Calling me woke is like calling me good looking
"Republicans love people who are ""woke"" if they are on their side.

""Wake up sheeple!""

""Take the red pill""

Waking up to the evils of the other side is good.  Waking up to the evils of my side is bad."
Woke = Actual US history involving minorities
Woke is a slur for Evidence Based Thinking.
"Wokism is really just post-modernism, and the traditional republicans are still struggling to grasp modernism, so they’re not ready to deconstruct what they’re struggling to construct in the first place."
"Just as they can never quantify ""big"" v ""small"" government."
And the cultists don't care in the slightest.
"Willful ignorance is the opposite of ""woke"" so they can start with that."
Struggle implies that they care to make the effort.
"""So? We don't know how a dog whistle works either..."""
"Republicans today seemed like no more than a turn the back the clock to a time, which no decent person prescribes to and a time that is lost in history. We are no longer are a manufacturing Empire"
Almost as hard as defining what a woman is
"I had someone call me “woke” the other day, like it was the biggest insult they could think of.  I just stumbled on this quote, and thought “yea, I’m woke.”

“I think we’re just communicating wrong, because, like, what I know ‘woke’ to mean is, like, learning new things about people or the world, and then acting accordingly. Like, basic kindness. Maybe a gesture of care to people who are more vulnerable than you. You know what, actually you wouldn’t like it — it’s Jesus stuff.” — SARAH SILVERMAN"
Funny thing is his lawyers actually defined what woke means in a court setting under oath. Funny how things change when you’re under oath.
"That's exactly what it means but expanded to include gays, immigrants and anything the Rs hate."
I’m proud to be an uppity woke lefty.
That’s like those shirts that say “reject scientism”
"People have been awakened to some of societies’ ills and have acknowledged that things need to change. However, there’s people that don’t want that change like DeSatan."
"It’s hard to learn things when you are asleep, so they don’t."
well said
You’re going to get fried for this here but you make some solid points. The republicans are annoying because they’re just blatantly disinterested in helping the average person. Democrats are annoying because they’re the most tone deaf people.
but ur missing the point. favoritism (written into laws) of those groups is fundamentally wrong and unconstitutional. counterdiscrimination is still discrimination.
Especially if the only people who will hate me are just people on Facebook who do their own research.
That’s an insult to Satan
"That is a nonsensical argument. Take the Voting Rights Act, it was written because blacks were specifically targeted with attacks on their right to vote. Righting that wrong isn't reverse discrimination at all. And guess what, as soon as the conservative court rescinded it there have been renewed attacks which shouldn't be a surprise."
"So how do you rectify damages and inequities caused by such discrimination?

If you have a race where one person is allowed to run free and the other is chained to the starting line, simply removing the chain after 5 minutes does not make the race suddenly fair. So how would you rectify this without giving some benefit like a speed boost to the formerly chained racer?"
That's not favoritism or discrimination. That's called equality. What Republicans are trying to do is reverse equal rights to counter change that has resulted in minorities and other affected communities having equal rights and a voice. That's not favoritism. Favoritism is giving rights above others. Anti woke is just anti equality.
"Oh, they hate on me in person in my neighborhood.  Lol!  But there are a handful of us.  More every year.  We aren’t shy.  I have an upcoming lunch date with our republican mayor."
im all for righting wrongs. not for violations of the 14th amendment
by addressing poverty. not racism.
any affirmative action policy is quite literally discrimination
And when racism is the cause of the poverty?
"Religious freedom should end at the tip of someone else’s nose, and religious discussion longer than 10 minutes should be banned in all taxpayer funded buildings."
Christian nationalists are no different than Nazi collaborators in occupied France.
"> They fired the county administrator and replaced him with John Gibbs, a former Trump administration official, Christian missionary, failed congressional candidate and election denier who once suggested women should not have the right to vote. 

The right-wing can’t help but ally themselves with the most grandiose reactionary fraudsters that promise a feast and deliver a shit sandwich. 

The article goes on to mention alleged open meeting violations, a risk of credit rating downgrades, and other self-inflicted wounds of the “anti-woke” crusade that brooks zero challenges to maximal white Christian privilege in “our” community."
"The most shocking aspect of this imo is educated people taking part in the problem. How can attorneys, judges and doctors be for such things? The toxicity of the movement involves brainwashing to the educated and or giving themselves permission to express their hatred."
"As a Michigander I can attest that this is DeVos country through and through. They are quite comfortable with religion in the public sphere, in fact, they want it, they embrace it and they believe they are god’s warriors. White Supremacy is generally carried by the educated elites. They do not want to share power, they believe they are racially superior (even if they don’t believe it about themselves) and they are quite comfortable dictating the lives of others. This is their comfort zone. Get used to it because racists no longer fear backlash for their beliefs. They have a platform and they will use it."
"We aren't paying alimony, period. Those freeloading Red states can all get jobs!"
Is this sedition?
One of the top five stupidest people in congress.
They’d love it til they started starving to death and their infrastructure fell apart without the influx of funding from democratic states.
"This is one of those things that sounds good in theory, but if they went through with it, they'd soon realize with horror it was a huge mistake."
"Horrible on the surface.

If it went through, the red states would last a whopping 5 years at best. This is assuming that there is an equitable exchange for property between those wanting to leave each state. 

Between the complete loss of social safety nets, elimination of minimum wage, loss of industry, a near complete brain drain, loss of extra tax revenue, high rate of natural disasters, high poverty, and loss of environmental contralsand the high rate of gun ownership and related violence - they would lose working age and elderly population at an extremely accelerated rate, have an abundance of youth that are unwanted, have no trade with many nations (low quality products or balk at needing to meet regulations), and become a theocracy that even the Taliban would be protesting as extreme.

The blue states, even if separated east and west, would have a massive set of economies right out of the gate. And without having to carry the regressive states their economies would explode with growth. Education, lifespan, Healthcare, infrastructure, wage, etc would all increase in short order."
I keep saying we're about 5 minutes from handmaid's tale... And no one wants to listen to me.
Apparently not realizing every state has both in each.
How unamerican.
"How bout a national divorce from her, sheesh!"
"This is dumb.  Even the most extreme states are split 65/35, and half of us don’t even vote.  This concept of a state being red or blue is ignorant bullshit."
This is sedition.   She needs to be charged and removed from office.   This crap isn't funny any more.
Don’t threaten the blue states with a good time
"These are the morons that call everyone else in the world ""DIVISIVE""

This freakish fringe element needs to be removed from power so America can get back to being America"
Because the conservative states have been fucking their personal trainers
Se being so familiar with divorce…
So where does her Georgia go? Biden won for President and they have 2 Democratic Senators.
Is that because the red states got caught fucking their crossfit trainer?
"Some people really do need to change their party affiliation. MTG ran on the GOP platform issues and benefits from GOP donor PACs.

Its a shame that her voters keep overlooking her stark departure from platform principles. A united coalition of states and constitutional republic is littered throughout the last approved platform."
Guess we know who failed American history in high-school.
How about a legal separation of stupid from the rest of us?
"Yeah, no one cares what you say Marge."
Insurrectionist. Charge her.
And the Republicans say that WE hate America!
Sis is literally calling for a civil war and succession in 2023
How do we decide? Is there a states draft? Who gets first pick? Who is the first pick overall? You know Republicans want nothing to do with California. The democrats would be smart to leave California on the board until the late rounds...take a solid purple state early! Do states get to test the free agent market every couple of years?
Lmao red states will starve
What a mess.  Let's hope she becomes less popular after all of this.
Only if all the conservatives from my state can move there and the poor liberals stuck in those states can leave and move here.
"She needs to know that states aren't monolithic. 

Yes,  California is Blue, but there are more conservatives living there than in the Dakotas.

""Swing states"" are almost equally split,  hence their name."
We all want a national divorce from you as well Marge. Hopefully they put her with the rest of the insurrectionists when this is all concluded.
"To be fair, she *does* have experience in these matters…the “divorce” part, I mean."
"Yes, please"
Who?
"America, love it or leave it bitch."
McCarthy breaking out the shush finger a little too late.
Giving up already sis?
So she wants to succeed from the Union! Traitors have no place in Congress! USA! USA!
Stop subsidies from wealthy blues states to poor red states for a month. Let their constituents feel what secession would be like.
"What are they doing to use for currency, thoughts and prayers?"
Do it.
"Not the worst idea, take every county that voted red and kick em out and see how quickly it collapses"
"I still do not understand how MGT and the rest of her ilk see that option as a good idea. What she is asking for is the literal end of the nation. Six months out, we’d be Albania with better roads. Either that or a Balkan-like dissolution."
There is no partition of the United States that does not result in millions of deaths.
Red States are sucking up more than their fair share of tax dollars
"They'll have an argument for alimony, though."
Yes. From a member of the House Homeland Security Committee no less.
Yes
And treason considering we are still at war with Somalia and Yemen and probably a few others. Causing seditious secession definitely gives aid and comfort to our enemies.
"Yes but you’re forgetting the caveat: Rules for thee, not for me."

"I’d swear if she had two brain cells she’d be pregnant.  

Actually, she has two they’d be fighting for third place."
No she’s not dumb. Boebert is dumb. MTG wants to weaken the United States so that people like her can run their counties as personal fiefdoms where they’re free to abuse their residents at will. She knows exactly what she wants and this is how to accomplish that
Then they would eventually become the migrants they hate so much.

">The blue states, even if separated east and west, would have a massive set of economies right out of the gate

Ikr. Even though a Red State would look bigger, most of the population would be in Blue State: California, New York, the Midwest. Red states would only have Texas.

>become a theocracy that even the Taliban would be protesting as extreme.

Republicans have abandoned the ideal of democracy in pursuit of Christian theocracy that would indeed be similar to regimes like the Taliban or Saudi Arabia."
"The red states produce most of our food. The big exception is California, but that is highly dependent on them getting Colorado River water, rights they may lose in such a divorce, which would crash their agriculture industry.

It’s a bad idea all around. I once saw conservatives say the red states should start exporting their food for cash instead of shipping it to blue states so they would starve out."
Blue states on the East and West can always join Canada
That’s why i can’t watch the show. It feels too real
"Yeah, the US (and frankly the world) isn’t divided by individual states (or provinces or what not). It’s pretty clearly a rural/urban divide."
Also unChristian
Too bad they'd no longer be in a jurisdiction that can award it.

4.	Nebraska, red.
5.	Minnesota, blue.
6.	Kansas, red.
7.	Illinois, blue.
8.	North Carolina, red.
9.	Wisconsin, red. 
10. Indiana, red.

It’s not as one-sided as you might think."
They can sell us food and get along without the additional subsidies they get now.
"Unless you are a pregnant woman, of course."
"It goes beyond just the population. Technology and innovation are cornerstones of an educated population, something that the red states do not generally like or do well. The creation and production of services and products are far more likely to be housed in these states. Social safety nets are also a cornerstone of a strong society that grows and withstands (the ultimate irony is that the Christian theocracy the red states would likely make should have such, but won't)."
"The water is a problem on the surface and would be fora to brief period of time.

The big issue is cost. Right now, for the US, it is cheaper to ship water in from other countries than to desalinate. Such a separation would result in massive alterations to the water economy with desalination being a huge change for the west.
Food would also be a minimal factor, except when combined with desalination and vertical farming with hydroponics.

There is an additional way to make the red states lives complete hell, removing a pathway for trade to Oceania. Makes it easy to force the hand."
"Possible, but unlikely. California and New York alone is already a larger economy than Canada."
"That would increase Canada's population by 5x.  

It would be Canada joining blue USA.  Canada could absorb Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, or Washington, but even Washington would instantly become one of the largest, wealthiest, provinces."
"Even urban and rural places are full of both sides.  

In rural areas, when one side gets oppressive, the other is more quiet in public, but they still vote their conscience."
You need to brush up on what freedom of speech is and isn’t. A member of congress speaking in an official manner is not the same as some dude at a bar.
"She is definitely good at getting noticed. She reminds me of the loud mouth, shit talking girls from school who thought they were popular."
Then on top of it started with desolate agricultural zones would recurve tons of funding to stay up again.
Wisconsin has voted blue in 9 of the last 12 presidential elections including Biden in 2020.
Iowa is purple.
"You're right; in most metrics, blue states outperform most red states. The only state that could even come close to them is Texas."
"Have you noticed how few desalination plants California has despite having been in severe drought for well over a decade? The powerful environmental groups and their own red tape are often successful in stopping them. One in Hunting Beach was to produce 50 million gallons a day, blocked. The loss of the Colorado would be devastating."
"Yeah, but she didn't advocate for violence or rebellion, right? Her speech could be interpreted as advocating for peaceful seccesion."
"I find it hilarious that I’m getting called out for ranking too red. I honestly did it intentionally because the list would have been dominated by blue.

Within my lifetime WI went from a state that was very similar to MN, but hasn’t been trending that way. In the event we were to split up red and blue states, I do not think it would join red, if only because it would then be a red island surrounded by blue IL, MN and MI with maybe a couple hundred miles of IA border?"
Iowa was people up through Obama's term.  It's red now.
"Yeah, I just spent a decade in MN and by comparison, I let my personal bias leak in."
"Texas' strength relies upon federal contractors and oil refining (I would add cattle, but they have a huge drought issue killing it), not education. 

They would have a helluva time protecting their border, and when they add the fear of liberals into it, the massive borders with the blue states.

The blue states would have a strong military in short order because of the threat posed by the red states and inherit a deep blue capacity and a nuclear triad."
"It comes down to money and willpower.

Assume that the country splits, to Colorado River will be basically shot. So, for the west coast blues to survive a major change would be necessary.
Strong water restrictions combined with massive levels of innovation that would inevitably occur."
Secession in and of itself is seditious because it goes against the *United* States. Peaceful or not.
"So in the context of her previous statements that Nancy Pelosi is guilty of treason and treason is punishable by death, do you personally still feel she's advocating for peaceful secession?"
It's not that you're ranking too red It's just that you're making definitive statements that are untrue. Like calling Michigan blue in this comment.  Michigan went blue in only 7 of the last 12 elections and voted the same as Wisconsin in the last 8 elections. So to call one red and one blue doesn't make any sense.
">Texas' strength relies upon federal contractors and oil refining (I would add cattle, but they have a huge drought issue killing it), not education. 

I don't know, they also seem to have a thriving manufacturing industry.

>The blue states would have a strong military in short order because of the threat posed by the red states and inherit a deep blue capacity and a nuclear triad.

I don't know about this either; I think most nuclear weapons are located in the red states (WE COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS!!). We might have a USSR situation, but worse."
"They've been in a historic drought for over a decade, and we aren't seeing any innovation. We're seeing water restrictions, but only on the residents, not on the agriculture that uses most of the water, so it's not really helping. The environmentalists are pretty powerful there, and it would require them being pretty much sidelined to solve the water problem. It's possible, but not likely."
"Yeah so? That doesn't automatically disqualify her from congress. Perhaps grounds for impeachment, but definitely not automatic disqualification."
Nope. I never said Marjorie Taylor Greene is a peaceful person. Don't get me wrong at that.
"It’s an internet comment, not scientific research, and I’m not basing it on presidential elections, but more the cultural leaning at this time. IF this thing that isn’t going to happen were to happen, it wouldn’t be decided by how the state voted in the last Presidential election. 

Republicans in WI have a dominant advantage over Democrats in the legislative bodies, but a Democrat in the governor’s office. MI has the Democrats with narrow leads in both legislative bodies and control Governors office.

That’s the difference between a red state and a blue state."
"Manufacturing relies on innovation and intelligence. The people will die from so many services being subpar throughout their new nation. They would need automation, but would they have the ability to create it or keep it running?

The nuclear weapons aspect, all would have them. It's still M.A.D."
"Red states get the ICBMs, but blue states would get the navy and their nuclear subs.  

Of course, in an actual divorce, the split would be negotiated.  The blue states would have something like North Korea in a generation."
"Just fyi presidential election results aren't scientific research, it's just something you google. I think our difference in opinion comes from how we think this fake thing was happening. I was thinking brexit with a vote, in which case statewide elections are the best guide. But it could also be led by the state legislator which would follow what you're thinking."
"Yeah, I never considered a state wide vote, that would certainly have an effect on the outcome. 

I only meant the “scientific” thing as admission that I was being subjective, and I don’t find presidential elections to be a good just as “cult of personality” and  party fatigue can have as much of an impact as the winning candidate. 

I’m ready to table this until we see the legislation proposed <please no>"
The Villiages is pure MAGA. They will become more obsessed living among only like-minded deranged neighbors.
"From what I know, it's pretty much a fascist retirement enclave that completely ignores the truth that the Republifascists want to abolish Social Security."
"I’m about 50 miles south of the Villages in Orlando.  Everything outside of Orlando is deep red.   MAGA trucks, billboards of Trump.  DeSantis is a God to them as he “owns the libs” everyday.   Sadly, your sister and BIL will fall in love with it.  This is their people.  Especially the villages."
There's a documentary about the Villages called Some Kind of Heaven from 2020. It didn't go much into the political foolishness but you get an idea of the types of people that live there.
"It's MAGA world all over. However, as many pieces of shit that live there, there's still a ton of things to pass retirement away down there. 
 
Also, lots of STDs there. Villagers like getting it on."
It's the boulllibasse of FL man stories. Absolutely nuts place.
Hedonistic village.
"We have friends that live in the Villages. They choose who they socialize with very carefully because the majority of inhabitants are right-wing whack jobs, and as obnoxious as all get out. Still, it's a nice place with lots to do."
They'll probably love it.. they'll be right at home
I mean if they have seen everything trump has said and done and they still support him.  They are at the apex of horrible. It cannot get much worse.
Late but I’m here now… visiting my parents. I’m only 32 and def not a trump supporter and haven’t seen a lot of maga shit yet (then again I’ve spent most of the time inside- it’s scary. May get run over by a golf cart 🛒) however…. this one old guy did curse my parents out for bringing their dog to an outdoor seating restaurant 😒 he said “you brought your fucking dog?” I gave him the finger and he called me a “tattooed liberal” 🙄 I’m only here for two more full days—— not sure I’ll survive another night. Send help.
It's full of STDonalds and STIvankas.
They only see what fox allows them to see. I Agree unfortunately.
You can outrun him for sure. Thanks fellow tattooed liberal!
"The real problem is that gasoline is a legacy aviation fuel, and the average age of the GA fleet is almost 40 years. 

100LL is already more expensive than Jet-A; switching to 100UL will increase operating costs even more. The best, long-term solution is to adopt diesel-cycle piston engines that allow piston-powered GA fleet to operate on Jet-A. Such engines have been available since 2007, and are rapidly gaining in popularity. As a spark-ignition gasoline aircraft is retired, it is just as likely to be be replaced with a compression-ignition diesel aircraft as another a gasoline aircraft. 

The market for AVGAS has likely peaked, which is good news and bad news for lead issues.  The good news is that there will be fewer and fewer aircraft needing lead. The bad news is that potential producers of unleaded fuel will be entering a rapidly declining market, so have little incentive to try."
Do you know if there are existing STCs for those engines to go into certified aircraft?

"Qualified immunity was meant to protect government officials from civil liability when carrying out their job. It has seemingly been expanded to protect them from criminal charges as well which is insane. 

It clearly needs to be abolished"
"Don't forget civil forfeiture and ""stop and frisk"" policing. I don't understand how courts have consistently upheld the legality of practices the fourth amendment was specifically written to prevent."
Add it to the list. Citizens United is doing the same.

"qualified immunity has never stopped any bad cop from being fired or hired.

"I consider Ron DeSantis and Greg Abbott to be the worst two Governors in the country.  DeSantis has messed Florida up so badly that I'm not sure I would even accept an invitation to an all expenses paid beach vacation there at this point.

He's in my mind as bad as Trump, if not worse, and I consider Trump the worst President in the history of the nation, and believe that Trump incited a violent coup attempt against our government that also qualifies as domestic terrorism, an attack I feel was worse than 9-11.

So, I am in no way trying to defend DeSantis or let him off the hook by saying this, but calling someone with Italian ancestry a meatball has (perhaps unintentional) racist overtones.  I think it would be a mistake for Democrats to pick up on this and run with it.  It violates our principles of tolerance, inclusion, and racial diversity.

Let's come up with a derisive nickname that has nothing to do with him being Italian."
"I am counting on the derps doing precisely the WRONG thing! ""More Meatball!"""

"Such a genuinely decent human being. His work with Habitat For Humanity proves that. His participation isn't just for show—he's been there, getting his hands dirty, building homes with the other volunteers. It's a testament to his genuinely kind and giving nature. When the time comes, his absence will be a real loss."
"Prepare for R'wingnut attempts to trash Carter and make his administration seem horrible.

However, high inflation and high unemployment were here during Nixon - Remember his attempt at 'Wage and Price Controls'? or Ford's ""WIN"" buttons? The poorly financed Vietnam War and the OPEC embargoes were the main drivers. The stagflation and 'malaise' under Carter set the stage for Reagan's BAD POLICY of borrowing in the name of all and cutting taxes appreciably for a lucky few AKA 'trickle down' - a fancy name for stealing from all to give to a few. The nation's tax policy has been stuck in that groove for 43 years. It's up to us to end it by only voting in politicians who are willing to end it.

Before Reagan, this raid on the Treasury would have been UNTHINKABLE and was the first step in the immiseration of the middle class. $30 trillion borrowed over 43 years is the same as borrowing $50 per week from EVERY AMERICAN alive for or born since the Reagan Inauguration...approx 11.6 billion person years. $112,000 from each American alive for the entire 43 years.

The Gini Coefficient was 0.34 during Carter's administration. It is 0.52+ today. Carter wasn't the villain and the extremes that were enabled under Reagan need to end."
"He exemplifies true Christianity.  By his works you shall know him.  

He didn't catch any breaks as President.  First the oil crisis, then high inflation which the Fed fought by causing a major recession, then the overthrow of the Shah and the 400 day hostage crisis, exacerbated by Reagan's deal with Iran not to release the hostages before the election.

Sadly, his human rights foreign policy didn't outlast him, so here we are holding hands with MBS, Putin, and other brutal dictators.

No President has ever given more of his life to benefit those who needed help."
I'm liking this comment but I still hope you're wrong.

Kind of like Fox is owned by a corrupt foreign media mogul who values profits over truth and integrity.

Donald can call DeSantis whatever he wants. Ron’s too much of a chicken shit to stand up to anyone

"Remember the 2012 elections?   
The republicans ran an absolute clown show and sunk themselves.   
its about to happen again."
"Yeah, like 2016 :-/"
He kind of is though. DeSantis is terrified of even saying a word to defend himself or attack his opponent.
Same reading level too
"He's going to take every opportunity to state that he's not going to call DeSantis ""Meatball Ron."""
"Please, please don't put that image into my head"
I hope.
It's all a show. I guarantee it.
We all saw how that turned out for lyin' Rafael Cruz the Canadian zodiac killer with the troll wife and assassin father.  I'm sure Meatball Ron will be just fine.
"Honestly I don't think that's it. Desantis is much smarter than trump. I believe he recognizes that publicly acknowledging trump's dumb fucking bullshit is a way to empower him almost. What does trump hate more than anything in the world? Being ignored.      
On that note what does desantis hate more than anything else in the world? Minorities."
There's a video of Hawley blowing his cousin. Would that help?
DeSantis acting weak and scared of conflict is on brand for him. Donald bullying the entire GOP into submission is what he does
Thought that was Madison Cawthorn?  Or was it Matt Gatez?  So many sex scandals in the GOP it’s hard to keep them all straight.
DeSantis looked scared to death in his debates in the past.  I can’t imagine what he will do in a nation GOP primary field debate with Trump there.  He might melt.
Republicans had a hard time keeping their sex scandals straight
"And apparently he’s very easy to rattle with questions, he legit gets salty. It’s why he stopped taking questions at press conferences"
"If a candidate can't take questions from the public they serve, they don't need to be in political office or any positions of power.

"Loyalty to the donors is what counts to them, not loyalty to the constituents"
"What happened to the Republican's healthcare plan, infrastructure plan, immigration reform?  What a stupid premise."
Too bad Democrats don't have the as whole gene like most Repelikans
"Yep. Though that's the case on both sides. The Republican advantage, though, is that they can give what they want to their donors (e.g., tax cuts) and sell it philosophically to the voters (e.g., small government, individual liberty, personal responsibility, the invisible hand, etc.). A Dem has to convince middle and sub-middle classes that they're going to fight for things like higher minimum wage, Medicare for all, more affordable post-secondary education, cheaper pharmaceuticals, etc., all the while making it perfectly clear to Aetna, Pfizer, university system donors, etc that they won't actually do this stuff."
What you just said has precisely no relevance to the argument that I made. You clearly haven't watched the video. And you don't have to (obviously). But just know that what you just said in no way contradicts anything that I said. This will be my last reply for time-saving reasons.
"The only reason the student debt relief didn't happen was because the repubs sued it to death. Especially when the left has gone to all the effort to prove its legal. Unless the left was that cynical to do all that knowing that SCOTUS was going to arbitrarily rule against it anyway.

Maybe I am ignorant, what does a University donor gain from a less affordable education? If we are talking funding university research, that has nothing to do with whether a student is neck deep in debt. University boosters for sports programs also has nothing to do with an individual student's debt.

And I had a rebuttal against your main assertion but its almost 3am, I'm tired of thinking lol"

"They helped create a monster, MAGA and a incredible Disinformation machine which had nothing to do with honesty in reporting, ( Tucker and Hannity  as examples ) now caught up in their own lies and a threatening  monster which has no morals they don’t know what to do.

"Every time I hear ""this is a freedom of speech issue granted by our constitution"", it reminds me of the whole mask issue. 

The mask is constantly criticized by the ignorant as not being effective in protection against viruses. But the primary purpose of the mask is to prevent the wearer from SPREADING a virus. In that regard, it is almost perfectly effective and the reason people needed to wear masks, but all you heard was that they didnt do any good for protection of the wearer. 

The protection of free speech in this country to prevent the GOVERNMENT from suppressing people from uttering their beliefs and opinions. It has little to nothing to do with protecting a private citizen or organization from committing libel or slander against another.  

But when you make a shitty argument in court, the best idea is to pound the table and pull out the constitution that you dont understand."
"They should really be charged for the damage they have done. Unfortunately, it's probably all *barely* legal.

As much as this is exploding all over the place, I doubt many Fox viewers will even see it since it's the lamestream media. That's the part that REALLY makes me sad. 

They should be required to be MUCH more upfront that they are not a news network. They're very dangerous."
I do believe in karma. They have a reckoning that will hopefully bring them all down. When that happens they will have a surprised look on their face and ask what did I do?
"The Republicans running the country are a group of vicious goons. This is because their voters are hate filled paranoiacs. And this is because they have been gavaged utter poison nonstop for three decades by Fox.  
Fox is correct to be terrified by the monsters they have created but the monsters remain their fault. In the face of emerging world peace and in desperate need of an “other” to be the villain, they chose the Democratic Party, half of America, and spun a lie so ridiculous we didn’t take them seriously. And as the lie got stronger they intensified their ideological purity until more and more of the Republican Party was also cast out. And now that their monster is thirsting for blood they don’t know anything but how to spur them on."
Shocker
I found it telling that really they are just talking heads. They read from a prompter. Their text messages said a different story. I think what all networks really come down to is the opinion of 1 or 2 top execs.
Whats also funny is that its cnn.com reporting this 🤣
Good. Time to shut the shit down.
Welcome to the least shocking news of this century
But but but CNN and MSNBC... They're faker! Bigly faker!
That's what they get for catering to fascists. It seems like such an easy grift until they find someone even worse than you.
I don’t love fox but methinks this reporting is a smidge biased.
Exposed?
Isn't it terrified of losing their audience? Big difference.
The Snowflake channel has always been nothing more than propaganda for the GQP. Maybe this time they'll pay the price for it.
"The texts between Hannity and Mark Meadows already showed that Fox was coordinating its ""news"" with the trump administration. That was back in 2019."
Yup.  Their new boss is hard right and dragging CNN in that direction.

It’s much easier to have other people tell you what things say and mean. Not as much thinking involved and thinking is hard.
The same could be said about the Bible.
Yes! Marjorie taylor green and fox news both have stated in court on the stand that what they said were meant to be jokes and that no reasonable person would take it literally.
It is amazing that they base so much on the Bible having clearly never read it.
The part about “reasonable” is true.

Are these assholes seriously co-opting yet another cool old thing?"

"so one asshole puts up a billboard for hate and bigotry... and that's fine,

but someone else puts up a billboard about inclusiveness, and that gets death threats

just... I can't even"
"“
Placek was unable to be reached for comment, but previously said he means no harm and hopes instead to “take back the country and get God back in our government and in our schools.”
“

Ugh, disgusting"
"The wave of bigotry spreading across the US isn't natural, and doesn't represent Americans. It represents a tiny number of entitled, rich far-right elites."
I'm sure the people who called in death threats were just seething seeing that billboard on their way back from church.
That’s a very naive assumption. The bigotry has always been there. Certain events have emboldened the bigots to say it out loud instead of behind closed doors. I grew up in a community filled with people like that. Took me over a decade after moving away to finally rinse my shitty upbringing away. It’s insidious as all hell.
"you can't KILL the death penalty, man!"
"There are people that should not be in society due to their danger to others (e.g.   
Martin Shkreli)

We don't have a good way to deal with them and the prison system iin Americais beyond broken.

I am not sure that that dealth is the right solution but providing them housing, entertainment, education, and food that lots of homeless don't get seems wrong."
"This makes so much sense:

>By not spending exorbitant amounts of money on a system that does nothing to deter crime, greater resources would be available for other areas of public safety, such as cases currently uninvestigated and unprosecuted, evidence based community crime prevention programs, and even conviction integrity measures."
"It's about revenge to the backwards ""eye for an eye "" crowd"
Some Humans want death. Stop pretending that humans are so much more important than any other animal on the planet. Most liberals would kill a mosquito but the death penalty? There's no difference.
"I agree. Also the way out prison system is, it’s more of a punishment to slowly rot away. I mean death is mercy compared to life in prison. Which is another thing, I refuse to believe people should be defined by their worst moment. Some people deserve to rot forever but some well the way we treat them is inhumane"
"CCC 2267 Recourse to the death penalty on the part of legitimate authority, following a fair trial, was long considered an appropriate response to the gravity of certain crimes and an acceptable, albeit extreme, means of safeguarding the common good.  
Today, however, there is an increasing awareness that the dignity of the person is not lost even after the commission of very serious crimes. In addition, a new understanding has emerged of the significance of penal sanctions imposed by the state. Lastly, more effective systems of detention have been developed, which ensure the due protection of citizens but, at the same time, do not definitively deprive the guilty of the possibility of redemption.  
Consequently, the Church teaches, in the light of the Gospel, that “the death penalty is inadmissible because it is an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person”, and she works with determination for its abolition worldwide."
Amen
"I also do agree. Given some people purposely commit non violent crimes to get housing and healthcare in the USA. That part should make us ashamed, many of the crimes we have could be prevented from universal healthcare, fixing the homeless, poverty and lack of education."
Should we be treating prisoners more inhumanely ?
"Well in very extreme cases you could just make it cheap. There are painless ways to die that won't cost millions. 

The only place I faulter is that too many innocent are killed and I don't know of a way to stop it."
"> Some humans want death.

People on death row are not asking to get their execution moved up. That doesn’t happen. Childish lie.

Lives up to your username, I guess."
a human is significantly more valuable than a mosquito.
"Exactly. A lot of people are in prison to provide free labor and profits for the prison industry. They have no business being there.

On the other hand you also have people who should never be allowed back out into the population. What do you do with them? A bit of a head-scratcher."
"The US prisons are already pretty inhuman. It just argues a bit towards getting rid of people who are a irridemable threat to society.

It is complicate to figure out what to do."
The legal fees on appeals will always be there. That’s much of the cost.
Are you certain of that?
Have you ever considered that as a possibility?
"That's what I'm saying also, maybe not clear enough. Until there is some way to make sure no innocent lives are lost then stop the practice."
"For why the 2nd Amendment exists, you’d probably need to ask a historian for a more specific answer. I think that the historical consensus is that it was not initially written as a means to protect individual use of firearms but rather the existence of a “well-regulated militia” composed of citizens that made a standing army unnecessary. This was because of the initial paranoia of tyranny that followed the Revolutionary War.

Unfortunately, subsequent judicial review does declare that most restrictions on individual gun ownership is unconstitutional, especially in relatively recent court cases such as NYSRPA v. Bruen, even though this is probably historically misinformed. Not that treating the Constitution as some sort of dogma is historically accurate or an intelligent thing to do in itself."
"Despite common folklore, it was never intended to be a path for a disgruntled citizen or group of citizens the power to overthrow a government that they felt was tyrannical, but that is the fantasy that many gun lovers cling to."
"The 2A is an anachronism, just like our Electoral College. Possibly useful at the time it was written, out of date for today's world. If the nation were not bound by divided politics both of these features would be amended. 

Remember that our Constitution was written in the 18th century by a group of men who established the first republic to break away from a European monarchy with 'liberty for all' while maintaining chattel slavery for some. Masters often need arms to maintain control over the enslaved.  
At the time, the nation was largely a frontier, the possibility of a 'new' community needing to respond to an attack by the aboriginals who weren't all that happy with the encroachment. Also, in the run-up to the American Revolution, the crown had outlawed or confiscated the firearms of many of the citizens. Establishing an amendment that would ensure this would NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN was important for the Founders. Thirdly, the U.S. was established with legal chattel slavery. Owners of the enslaved needed access to their arms to be able to respond to instances of insurrection by their property. Lastly, settlers of new frontier needed firearms to hunt and protect their persons and property when an established authority will not be able to respond.   
Today, the U.S. has no frontier...that ended in the 1890s...and police and National Guard handle pretty much all cases of riot. Chattel slavery ended 158 years ago. What's left? Personal protection and protection from a tyranny. Small arms are never going to defeat a tyrannical government that has access to drones, aircraft, tanks, etc. but some Americans like to believe they will. The only liberty personal ownership of a firearm actual enables is political assassination, imo.

So what's left? Personal protection. The only way that outlawing all personal firearms would ever work is if no one else had a firearm but since guns outnumber citizens....400 million guns for 335 million people!...That's not gonna happen anytime soon. 

The 30K+ 'lives lost to gunshot' is not worth it, imo. An amendment adopted in a time when three aimed shots per minute was a goal that most could not reach doesn't work when battlefield designed weapons can fire 30 aimed shots in under a minute. It enables too much slaughter.  
Changing an amendment is a very heavy lift - has to pass both chambers of Congress and then majority votes in 38 states! I believe that we could require liability insurance on any weapon taken out of the home and then let the insurance industry ratchet down the mayhem."
"Date of 2nd Amendment: 1791

Date of 1st Bullets created: 1847

There is NO way that the forefathers et al created the second amendment to be a free-for-all for the fucking gun nuts of today."
See your first problem right here is assuming rights are 'given' to you by the government.  That may be how it is in your country.  In this country rights are recognized and the entire purpose of the Bill of Rights is to establish that the government can't infringe on those existing rights.
"Gun ownership isn't going away, it's moot to suggest this. However, I think that an assault weapons ban, or at least much stricter gun ownership regulations are very plausible and reasonable. Even though I'm devout liberal, I support gun ownership for self defense and hunting. I don't like this whole idea and rhetoric about gun ownership as some warning to the our own government. I own an assault rifle and a few other guns, but that's mostly because I'm afraid of right wing fascists taking over."
"As someone noted r/askhistorians is probably a better place for this question.  Here’s a couple links to get the ball rolling. 

[One](https://reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/t80wiq/_/hzr6cve/?context=1)

[Two](https://reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/40ey8g/_/cyu0ji5/?context=1)"
"The second amendment was established to give a general public weapons to use against a tyrannical government. The founding fathers wanted its people to be armed so that they could defend themselves from their own government and from any foreign government that invades.

The US has not fought on its own soil in sometime and modern firearms (not referring to automatic weapons because  those are heavily monitored in the us) can unload a lot of bullets very fast. Something that the founders of america did not live with.

 The use of firearms by criminals Is routine in America. It is very easy to obtain a firearm in some states, and very hard in others. There are two arguments. 1) restrict guns through intense background checks and waiting periods to ensure only the best Americans have them. Effective at keeping guns out of the hands of criminals. 2) make it generally east for any non felon with stable health to own a gun.  Effective at stopping someone with a gun, but puts more guns in the general population.

Taking the second amendment away would make 1/2 the country go bananas. It would be difficult if not impossible to collect all the guns in America. Does the 2nd amendment make sense? Idk probably not, but it's with America forever.

Something to note, the VAST majority of gun deaths in America are due to suicide."
"The 2nd Amendment is blowback from the founder's fear of a standing army, which they feared would inevitably be used to repress the citizenry. Since they had neither the cash nor the desire for a professional army, they fell back on the state militia system that had been used in the colonial period. Each state had a number of volunteer militia companies that would get together occasionally for a little refresher drill, and the hope was that this structure could be the basis of a volunteer army, called up in times of emergency. The fact that The state militia system had (mostly) failed miserably in the Revolution seems not to have made much impression on the founders."
Many people have a fetish for gun ownership which the modern interpretation of the 2nd Amendment supports. No amount of logic is going to appeal to gun addicts.
The second amendment guarantees the people to defend themselves from threats of tyranny both foreign and domestic at its most basic level. The debate to whether it should still be relevant will never go away unless there is an amendment to the constitution.
"I used to be a 2nd amendment liberal. I grew up with guns and both of my grandfathers were avid hunters. Some of my earliest memories was spending the weekend at grandpas house and helping him clean his 50+ gun collection after going to the shooting range. That shit all changed for me Oct 1st, 2017 when that fucking asshole Stephen paddock shots up the country music festival in Vegas. I vividly remember a ‘switch’ turning off in my head, complete disgust for what he did and the rifles he used. 
I use the analogy that when I was a kid (kindergarten) I LOVED wearing cowboy boots. Unfortunately another child at my school also wore cowboy boots and kicked another student in the head with his pointed boot and he had to be rushed to the hospital to get stitches. After that day, pointed boots/cowboy boots were banned. I didn’t do anything wrong but because of the action of another individual I could no longer wear my favorite boots to school. Why can’t we do this shit with guns? I understand that 95% of gun owners may be lawful or whatever but all it takes is one psycho to ruin it for everyone. Fuck guns and the horse they rode in on. 
BTW, when my grandparents passed away the family split up the large gun collection. I had inherited around 16 rifles/pistols. I kept two, a 1906 German Mauser and my grandfathers 1911 service pistol from his time in the Korean War. The rest I gave to other family members or sold."
It did make sense back then. It's causing unnecessary harm in the present.
"When it was written,  it was valid. Today, it's just an excuse."
"Yes to a degree the second ammendment makes sense. I doubt our forefathers imagined a future however that had weaponry firing at 1000 rounds per minute. 

Anyone trying to make a case that the general public should be able to own anything is a nutjob.

Anyone trying to make a case that they need a fully automatic rifle or a simulated fully automatic via a bump stock is a nutjob.

No you won't be able to stand up to a tyrannical government with it. They have unmanned drones who can make your home cease to exist. 

Should people still be able to purchase firearms? Well there is a very close to zero chance that anyone ever gives up what they already own so yes I would agree that individuals should be able to purchase reasonable firearms. Shotguns, hunting rifles, handguns. 

However background checks need to be more serious. Not everyone should be allowed to purchase new firearms and I don't understand how that is controversial."
Because when seconds count the police are just minutes away.
"Three reasons:
NRA.
NRA.
NRA."
"At the time of writing the Constitution, the 2nd amendment made sense. In terms of today? No, it should be changed. I don't have an issue with owning a gun or two l. I am not against hunting, protecting one's property or going to the range. My issue is the public carrying or owning a shit ton of guns and ammo. I also feel there needs to be a limit on the type of gun a citizen can own.."
"I don’t understand liberalism. I build guns for fun, the technology to do so is available through decentralized networks, cad files being shared on the internet and using hardware parts to make functional weapons.  You’re delusional if u think laws are going to stop us from manufacturing our own.  Free people don’t need permission and like jstarks1809 said, “we’re pissing on the grave of gun control.”"
"the second amendment doesn't make sense in modern times. it was something written when at the time it made sense, when guns couldn't kill 50 people in seconds and before wars became fought with tanks and now drones. there is no way if America was formed now by the founding fathers that they would have put that in the constitution. the only reason it's still around today is because 40% (generous statistic) Americans have been brainwashed by NRA propaganda"
"To specifically address your question: the founding fathers in 1791 were wrong! It happens to the best of minds, this is how those minds learn. The problem is that the worst of minds don’t learn and don’t want to change."
The original intent of the law does not match its current interpretation
"In the 1700s, there weren't police departments. There wasn't a military the way there is today.  If there was an invading force, a bunch of guys would have to form an ad-hoc army of sorts to defend their town. Or if someone threatened you or your land, you had to be able to defend yourself since help wasn't going to arrive any time soon, considering there was no such thing as the phone.

Also at the time, the weapon of choice was a musket, a single-shot weapon that took, what, a minute to reload. The idea of a gun that would fire hundreds of bullets in a minute was far in the future.

Another problem is, yeah, the gun nuts misinterpret it. They ignore the ""well-regulated militia"" part and go straight for the ""shall not be abridged"" part."
Yea because it was never talking about personal gun ownership in the first place…
"Pretty much.

It came from an English law that stopped the king from disarming the barons."
It definitely doesn’t take a historian to understand why the wrote the 2nd amendment. It also doesn’t take above average intelligence to see why it’s no Longer relevant today and isn’t being used in the original way it was intended.
All SCOTUS decisions from 1795 to 2008 agreed that the 2A was strictly about membership in a militia and not about individual gun ownership. But even Scalia in the 2008 Heller decision said that there can still  indeed be \*restrictions\* on individual gun ownership.   -- Unfortunately the media and even Democrats like Hillary Clinton decided to go with the  utterly wrong   claim that  2A was \*always\* and \*originally\* about individual gun ownership.
">I think that the historical consensus is that it was not initially written as a means to protect individual use of firearms but rather the existence of a “well-regulated militia” composed of citizens that made a standing army unnecessary. 

You do need to protect that pre-existing natural individual right (per Cruikshank) if you want people to be able to show up with their arms in a militia. There is no historical consensus on this restrictive reading though. The idea that the right is somehow tied to militia membership didn't even exist in the federal courts until 1942, and the ""collective right"" wasn't formulated in such terms until 1976. Before that, with the exception of a couple state court rulings, it was always considered an individual right."
">first republic to break away from a European monarchy with 'liberty for all' while maintaining chattel slavery for some.

Yeah but that doesn't make the United States or the revolutionary war any less revolutionary; slavery was the reality of the entire world and the United States was way ahead when it came to abolition, at least in the north (Pennsylvania was the first ""democracy"" in the world to abolish slavery in 1780).


>Thirdly, the U.S. was established with legal chattel slavery. Owners of the enslaved needed access to their arms to be able to respond to instances of insurrection by their property.

I don't think this has any historical basis, since guns could also be acquired by the slaves and slave rebellions are something that would require the government to act, not individual people.

The second amendment, quite frankly, didn't need to be added to the constitution, but I don't think even Alexander Hamilton (who I think authored the second amendment) would have seen the problem it would potentially cause today."
"Um. The hand cannon or handgonne was used in China in the 13th century, working its way west until the 15th century, when it morphed into an Arquebus in Europe.
If bullets weren't invented until 1847, what were they shooting previously, spit wads? The founders were educated men who knew of the transformation of guns. For example, the Ferguson rifle. It was designed in 1770 and used by the British in 1777. This is a breech loading rifle that could fire 4 times per minute as opposed to the Brown Bess musket. They knew products would evolve in the future they just didn't know how. So, your argument is flawed."
"Cannons were privately owned during the revolutionary war. From my brief search out of curiosity, All the way up to 1812 there are records of private cannon ownership. I didn’t bother looking for more. If you’re arguing that a certain type of bullet should prevent gun ownership. Why isn’t lethality/damage range/splash damage considered? It isn’t, it’s simply a matter of discussing who gets the right to have the means of defending themselves.

Also, in reference to “bullets were created after the constitution was written.”  Argument. That’s a slippery slope - I would contend that none of the founding fathers presumed there would be no further tech development in any realm that the constitution addresses. They were all relatively intelligent, highly educated business owners and (some) inventors, especially for their time period. I doubt they thought tech had peaked for humanity in 1776. 

Gun Fudds will argue that if the second amendment applies only to muzzle loading muskets then freedom of speech/press only applies to a printing press and quill and ink. This is just the vicious cycle people often trap their debates in. It’s pointless and aggravating. Even the idea that founding fathers only meant freedom of assembly for meeting in the time squares/taverns/churches is probably the one constitutionally protected actions the founding fathers would be most surprised about how things have developed- proof of that is this discussion right here, we are assembled on a subreddit discussing politics over electric mediums -likely hundreds of miles away from each other.  🤯 

There is violence everywhere, shootings and stabbings and clubs can be found anywhere there is a human population. I grew up in countries with strict gun laws. I can tell you with firsthand experience that violent people will choose to be violent - regardless of the law that says they shouldn’t be. 
Regardless of wherever OP comes from, merely expecting another country to follow suit with the same rules and laws of wherever they came from seems a little bit on the “colonizer mindset,” of “my homeland is ethically better than yours bc this is what I’m familiar with first” which I don’t think they intend to mean?"
"Repeating firearms existed decades before the constitution was written.

And civilians owned *ships armed with cannon* at the time."
Would you turn your assault rifle over if stricter gun ownership laws were put in place?
"The NRA and the Republican Party will never allow it, and Democrats will not rock the boat.

As usual."
"When it was written, it was not meant to apply to citizens. It was to allow states to form militias.  James Madison defined militias to be what we call the National Guard."
"I never understood how people just cling to this belief that the founders could not envision modern weapons or only had access to only muskets when just a small amount of research debunks this claim so easily:

**""The founding fathers could have never envisioned modern weapons!""**

[The Girardoni, a semiautomatic air rifle, was in service with the Austrian army from 1780 to around 1815. It was famously used by Lewis and Clark on their expedition.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girandoni_air_rifle)

[Puckle Gun, patented in 1718, was capable of quickly firing multiple shots in rapid succession.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puckle_gun)

Surely it makes sense in modern times. Don’t you think that women should have the right to carry a gun? Or do you think they should have to wait to call the police and hope that they don’t get killed in the meantime?
"The problem lies with mass shootings. People are so confident that the second amendment will be enforced that mass shootings kill thousands each year here on US Soil. Men, women and children. 

Is that really “protecting the barons from the king”? Or it is plowing the fields for terrorists to be grown on? 

It’s a controversial topic, but I am of the opinion that we do need Gun Control (or in this case, Gun RESPONSIBILITY) laws to protect good people from people who wish to cause people harm."
But was it common law? I don't think so.
The 2nd amendment shouldn't have been incorporated against the states; the courts settled that fact years ago in the 20th century. There's literally no logical basis to incorporate the Second Amendment against the states.
">There is no historical consensus on this restrictive reading

Yes, there is a historical consensus as to what inspired the 2nd amendment.

>The idea that the right is somehow tied to militia membership didn’t even exist in the federal courts until 1942

That may be true, but historians have a disagreed with the courts on this matter. That was one of the main points of my comment. And quite frankly, I’d trust the academic historians over the biased judicial system."
"Not really. It wasn't interpreted by the Supreme Court until the early 1900s, and even then they didn't address the militia clause. The second amendment is unclear in this regard because it specifically references individuals and the militia. The well-regulated portion is usually all but forgotten by gun rights advocates."
slaves could acquire guns as easily as their owners.... is this a real argument?
Are you comparing that to an AR-15?
"You know that there are limits to First Amendment rights? Time and place requirements for permitted assemblies, obscenity prohibitions, copyright and trademark laws..."
Cool - let these mass murdering A-holes only bring muskets or a cannon from that time period to their next mall shooting.
"Yeah probably - I’m not going get all bent out of shape if everyone is told to turn them in. Even though I know there would still be millions of these things around illegally. I’d prefer a buyback but I’d take some tax deduction if necessary. I’m not going to lie to you - this thing is fucking vicious. I know the military version of the AR-15 is tougher, better, but this thing is built for some nasty business. If I ever had to sling that much hot supersonic steel at humans, I’m going to need a shrink, a lawyer, a priest, booze/Xanax about two weeks vacation. I bought it during the mass idiocy of COVID lockdown. I have 2 other guns that would not realistically be banned in my lifetime, so I’m confident I can defend my home/family if everything went to hell. My list of coping necessities above would also apply if I had to use my less scary weapons on anyone."
"Hey, Clinton got the assault weapons ban!"
">When it was written, it was not meant to apply to citizens. It was to allow states to form militias.

That states could form militias was already written into the initial Constitution. Writing the 2nd Amendment for that purpose would be redundant."
"Sorry, but that’s not true. It was to defend against the abuses of militias."
"And State Guards/Defence Forces, under the sole control of their State Governors. Not all states have them, but all states are allowed them."
"Yes I agree. All of those are very close to 1000 rpm and very similar to the portability and ease of use of the P90 which you can own as a US Citizen right now with little headache.

Your choice to pull some literal nonsense out and use it as an argument that the founding fathers could even remotely envision what firearms would look like 2 and a half centuries later is absurd. 

Get off it. I'm a gun owner. I likely own significantly more than you unless you own multiple full size safes. No we don't need fully automatic weapons and no the founding fathers didn't plan for this."
"I think a women has the right to carry a pistol or stun gun or any other less than 10 people targeted weapons, not an AR with a magazine big enough to kill an entire classroom"
"No, women should not be able to carry guns.  Other weapons and self defense items exist that can't be used to execute 30 people in less than a minute."
"UK Bill of Rights, 168?.  And yes, I think it is part of common law."
"Yeah, because slave rebellions were no joke. If that were to happen, then you'd require a state militia, not individual slave owners in possession of guns, because that wouldn't do much."
"Yes, I am in a way.  The point I was making is the evolution of technology. The modern javelin, as used in track and field, is very different from the ancient thrown spear.  Computers are nothing like the room sized behemoth used by NASA to launch the Apollo program.
 The founding fathers were very aware of changes, especially Benjamin Franklin. He was an innovator and inventor. He knew that guns would evolve along with everything else. They had already evolved in Europe, where the rifle was invented and brought to America, where they were tweaked to form the Pennsylvania/Kentucky long rifle. These changes and others were in the lifetime of the founders.

The founders were not stupid men. They knew exactly what they were doing with the 2nd A."
What is an AR-15? I always hear it talked about but I still don't know what it is?
"First copyright law was may 31, 1790. The first bullet was made post 1776. The government has made address of both those sectors several times over. I don’t see a problem here? But I do think that comparing “someone copied my notes and made the same thing,”/“someone yelled the B word on an airplane.” Are important things to address but hold little weight against a second amendment written to ensure immediate human physical safety. But I do think they help guarantee each other. 

People who breaks a law with a firearm sees a punishment for that - Anyone who infringes a copyright law gets their day in court too. There are rules and responsibilities places on citizens to be safe and honest with both."
"How am I incorrect?

Democrats don't have a very good track record of standing up to the far right.

It's always ""negotiate,"" ""build consensus with,"" etc.

You can LOL all you want but you cannot disprove that."
One good thing among his many Republican-lite defects.
"Article II section 2? Says that state militias will be controlled by the president when they're called into service for the federal government. I think what the prior poster was pointing out is that the bill of rights didnt stop individual states from enacting laws like banning guns (until the 14th amendment applied the bill of rights to the states as well).

When it was written, 2A stopped the federal government from making laws that kept state militia members from having guns. That way the states could form militias and the federal goverment wouldnt have the only army."
Proof?
I understand your point but why use blatantly false information it just makes you seem so disingenuous and a liar..an ar-15 shoots 400 rpm which is the rifle people are concerned with why are you inflating it to 1000? It makes you seem either ignorant on the issue or you are being overly sensational to be dramatic but in any case it makes people not want to take you seriously at all and just ignore your points..in the future just use the actual real data and facts
">UK Bill of Rights, 168?.

That wasn't common law; that is a statutory constitutional law. Also, the law only applied to protestants, and has been repealed since no person in the United Kingdom can acquire guns easily."
"So these men who believed nonsense in most areas of life anticipated these types of weapons and would be ok will countless dead children to keep muh guns. 

They were stupid men.

Sorry to burst your bubble."
"
>The first bullet was made post 1776.

No, it wasn't. Bullets have existed as long as guns have, paper cartridges were used as early as the 14th century, and repeating firearms existed before 1776."
"All it takes is enough votes, which will take more than 51 percent in both houses.  I bet if dems got to 60 percent in both houses, there would be enough votes to take decisive action."
"The first eight amendments are about individual rights. Saying it's about states takes it out of context. Gun control people give way too much importance to a participle phrase meant to show the importance of the right, and ignore the independent clause protecting the right."
"I never mentioned the AR-15. Nor did the initial post. I mentioned the p90 which has a theoretical limit of over 1100 rpm unless I'm mistaken.

Farther an AR15 can absolutely fire at about 900 rpm with minimal modification."
"Leave it to the internet to correct all the mistakes, 😂 yeah I was apprehensive about putting the history of bullets and cartridges in a debate about the 2A. According to my limited search, the first bullet was made by a Frenchman. What constitutes as a projectile discharged from a firearm really makes no difference to me when talking about the second amendment."
One can have a backbone without being an asshole.
Whether they *would* or not is open to question.

"The Ferguson Rifle saw some service in the Revolutionary War:

So, in the run-up to the Superbowl ad, M&M's announced that they were going to discontinue the M&M characters because ""...even a candy's shoes can be polarizing"". They tweeted that they were replacing the cartoon characters with Maya Rudolph. See here: [https://twitter.com/mmschocolate/status/1617518785686274052/photo/1](https://twitter.com/mmschocolate/status/1617518785686274052/photo/1)  
Of course the Super Bowl ad was nonsensical, about Maya Rudolph changing the candy into candy-covered clams, and by the end of the game, the cartoon characters announced that they were back and that they were here to stay."

"I think it mostly means socially progressive, I don’t think it has anything to do with anti-republicans, unless you’re talking about the US political party ?"
Really?...... because of progressive views we are labeled?
That’s EXACTLY what it means. It is the coward’s way of saying N-word and not getting bashed.
"Candy-covered clams sounds um, very SNL Maya."
Oh my god. What a brilliant inside joke. Love it. Thanks for taking the time to type it out. Much appreciated
"Why is this a thing, are we seriously arguing about an M&M not being sexy"
Exactly. Super bowl sponsors always put their super bowl commercials online cuz they want people to be able to watch them when they hear about them.
"No one is arguing, it’s more like, “wtf this time Fucker Carlson?”"
I'm not. You?
If we are making green sexy why can’t yellow or red have shedded abs?
"Oh don't worry, they'll find the next thing to be overly outraged about."
The wrong wingers are such petulant little farts.
"Good news: he's basically guilty of everything and we have the proof.

I maintain, as I always have, that the ""justice system,"" from Merrick the Meek and Mild on down, is *scared* of T****.

Please, no ""methodical,"" ""meticulous,"" ""airtight case,"" ""doing it right,"" ""Gotti/McVeigh/Kaczynski"" etc.

He is afraid of what will happen to him and his loved ones from MAGA goons, unless he leaves T**** alone.

I will not be moved on this *unless* the day comes that I see T**** in handcuffs and Garland saying ""Donald Trump is under arrest without bail, his passport has been taken and is being charged with sedition, insurrection and conspiracy resulting in death."""
He has never faced consequences and never will.
George Santos and the Case of the Missing GOP Respect for the Consent of the Governed
"Well, you can't ask Santos where the money went. He'll just lie about it."
"SO tired of him/this. I hope he has donated his brain to science upon his passing; it needs some serious study to find out what's encouraging this embodiment of lies. And how he lives with it. Some DNA testing is in order, too. This creature needs some serious evaluation. Is he just the first of many to come? Or is he actually the first fully configured ChatGPT Optimus bot and this is what we have to look forward to? Inquiring minds want know!"
"That’s crazy. Santos used to be the best investigator in the NYPD, and was James Bond for 3 movies. I’m glad he’s there to investigate this."
"Tomorrow’s headlines:

Chiefs fans rush field to prevent score from being counted"

"No single book is going to turn you into anything. What books will do is allow you to view things with an open mind. All oh the banned books you see today, I read in the 9th and 10th grade. I suggest you look at banned books list. Orwell is great, Vonnegut will make you think,. Catch 22, The Kite Runner, Fahrenheit 451, Maus, Dandelion Wine. Pick a couple and open your view of the world."
The Peoples History of The United States
"I think it takes more than 1 book. For me it took years of listening to conservative drivel, numerous podcasts on science and psychology and experiencing the southern Baptist church as a child. It all just coalesced into a light bulb moment on my way to work one morning. My conscience no longer struggles with the things I'm supposed to support and believe with what I actually support and believe."
The Jungle by Upton Sinclair
"Check your local library for a ""banned books"" section. Start there."
Anyone remember Reading Rainbow?
What are you now?
"Generally speaking, reading books, obtaining education and gaining knowledge will turn you into a liberal."
The Bible.
Shock Doctrine by Naomi Klein
Dark Money
The New Testament
"As many have said, there isnt just one.  But may I suggest your journey start with Uncle Tom's Cabin?"
A Thousand Small Sanities by Adam Gopnik
"IMO books will not make you 'liberal'. What has been well correlated with that is meeting and working with people from different backgrounds, perspectives, etc. So it isn't college that makes people liberal. It is meeting people different from yourself. 

Humans are really good at rationalizing and justifying their own world view. Books don't challenge that. Interacting with people does."
What ever text book they use in the Sociology 101 class at yiut local community college.
All of them. No seriously read all of them. It's often something intentionally overlooked by conservatives.

"None, but reading will help.

Try On Tyranny by Timothy Snyder.  Very short, but excellent read."
"All the jokes in this comment section aside, read “Why Nations Fail” it’s written by two very well established economists and is basically the reason I went from moderate right to moderate left. Balanced opinions and thought provoking commentary, easy read."

The Dawn of Everything by David Graeber
"The Bible, if you really read it."
"In the US read authors Al Franken and James Carville. Even some of their older more dated works are enjoyable, funny, and smart. Quick reads and they explain the whole idea behind American Democratic Party approaches to government."
Lol any book that doesn’t tell you what to think but makes you think
Any. If you are well read then you are more likely to be a liberal.
Any book but the Bible
This is a weird question. Why does reading great literature have to be political?
Anything informative.
The New Testament.  Jesus was pretty heavy on that help others stuff.
"If reading turns you into a liberal, you’re either reading propaganda or don’t know how to read"
Bible
"The Bible. Specifically the New Testament, the Old Testament is for the MAGAs. Or the Bhagavad Gita, Sidhartha by Herman Hess is a good one or Buddha: A Story of Enlightenment by Deepak Chopra."
Any book. Conservatives don't encourage reading.
"Besides the Bible as literature, just as others have recommended, or the 2023 GOP Platform.

 If you remain unconvinced, try being poor, as the bible asks, but only for a couple of years. You will learn the importance of co-existing with others, that everyone fears being poor and not just republicans, that people with the most comfort want more and maybe less willing to share the comfort."
"The, very liberal, red parts of the Bible are moving, to some people."
A theory of justice by John Rawls.
"Born a crime by Trevor Noah, if you want something entertaining.  

The Lie that Binds, if you want something well researched."
For everyone suggesting the Bible I must laugh. There are so few things it contains that are progressive.
Native Son by Richard Wright. The novel talks about Bigger Thomas and his encounter with systemic racism in 1940’s Chicago.
"I forced myself to watch videos from the library on subjects from a liberal viewpoint that I didn't want to watch at all. They, along with books and talking with open minded people, changed me over time, made me think more critically.

Pick up a book or video that makes you sick at the thought of watching or reading it and see what happens. Videos are a bit easier to begin with."
Kinda trash tbh. No reason to read propaganda to undo the propaganda you’ve already heard.

Came here to say this
Sermon on the Mount
"That is one great book! I read it for the first time when I was well into adulthood and believe it deserved every accolade it's ever gotten. It's certainly not a perfect novel, but it is powerful."
"Actually - just read the gospels.  It's a story about about a homeless wandering teacher who taught humility, sacrifice, tolerance and modest living.  He apparently hung out with the poor outcasts of society and spoke out against the wealthy, powerful religious types and their hypocrisy and abuse of power.  He was also a powerful advocate of social assistance, healthcare and community service.   In the end, he was murdered by the powerful elites and now his name has come to be associated with all of the things he apparently despised."
Great answer
It usually is if you consider the literary canon to be great literature.
Except ayn rand or Jordan Peterson.
Any recommendations or just your negative opinion?
I take it you haven't read the book
https://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/nyc-libraries-are-offering-free-digital-library-cards-to-people-across-the-u-s-041322
Take a look.
">In the end, he was murdered by the powerful elites and now his name has come to be associated with all of the things he apparently despised.

So true. It's so sad that there are more Christian conservatives in the US than liberal Christians. Because Jesus was about as liberal as they come.

If we could just get conservative Christians to adopt what Jesus was about, the US would be a great place."
"It’s more sexual than political. 

Sexual freedom, however, does require a peculiar political bent."
I put a recommendation in the thread. I just feel like Zinn is promoted by a lot of illiberal leftists and has a lot of weird points in there that obfuscate from a true academic reading of US history. Similar issue as the 1619 project.
Thanks for that!
It's in a book.
Thanks for the response.  Fair enough
It’s reading rainbow
"1) It seems they are getting away with it.
2) Women vote against women's rights.  They know who and what their voters are.  And they don't care about all the issues you raised.
3) Their voters believe Republican lies constantly, that is way Republicans lie constantly.  So they just keep lying.  And their voters still come out in huge numbers."
"The rich like the Koch's, the Murdoch's and others don't need or want a government for the people. They want a big military to defend their money globally, a big police force to defend them domestically and no taxes or regulations for them just for others to pay for it and be controlled.

To do this they run 24/7 right-wing news that the liberal strawman will use big government to take away your guns,  turn your kids gay and give all your hard earned money to minorities, immigrants and lazy people who didn't earn enough and need to live off of government hand outs (social security, etc...).

 --- which is wild considering a third of Florida's budget comes from federal money, while DeSantis touts a surplus and uses it to ship migrants around the country, and the top 10 states most dependent on federal government money are red states.

But wokeness, CRT, antifa and the debt are your greatest threats, not Putin or that hoax global warming or COVID or lack of investments in infrastructure to compete globally.  

And people like Trump and DeSantis and Republicans in general are essentially having a competition on who better to save you from this strawman liberal.  

The Republican goal is to implement an illiberal (or fake) democracy run by the elite conservatives that include the Koch's, the Murdoch's and others following the playbook of Viktor Orban that keeps them in power permanently.

And right-wing propaganda is here all over Reddit, almost every hour someone is reinforcing the right-wing message in subreddits like terribllefacebookmemes that pushes anti-woke propaganda under the guise of calling it out.

"The biggest news recently in conservative circles is Koch won't back Trump this time around. There's a reason this is big news.

""While the memo didn’t name a spending target, AFP’s affiliated super PAC spent more than $69 million in the 2022 cycle, according to Federal Election Commission disclosures. The Koch network joins the Club for Growth, another of the largest outside spenders, and several of the party’s biggest individual donors, such as finance billionaires Kenneth C. Griffin and Stephen A. Schwarzman in signaling their opposition to Trump’s current campaign. Others are holding back for now.""

"I think of the phrase, ‘any press is good press.’ From a certain perspective, putting those ideas out there is just giving them more exposure.

"The people responsible should be forced to sit in a room with all the burning chemicals they release, and they shouldn’t be let out until they change their ways…"
It's almost like having an economic system that gives people so much wealth effects your democracy or something
Safety rules are written in blood.  Republicans apparently don't care.
Drink this water.
"this is not an honest question, it does not come from a place of inquiry, rather it is a general and quite assuming and leading. All Liberals don't claim that, all don't support it, in fact they may not even have a position about the current economic system. The statement also assumes that the current system all it does is cause disparity and exploit. What the question is indicative of is the enquirer's state of mind and desire to troll."
"Too many people on the left side of the spectrum go for the “all or nothing” approach.  We do need serious structural changes to address all the issues you bring up and more. But sudden radical change typically comes with body counts and the resulting chaos ends up being more harmful than the system it replaces.  

Honest small reforms that move the needle are good.  Obamacare was obviously flawed, and a single-payer system would be more beneficial, but you cannot deny that people are better off today because of that law.  Keep working, keep pushing, but don’t throw away progress just because it doesn’t solve all problems in one swoop.  

Think of it like football, if you have a chance at a field goal, take it.  Is it as good as a touchdown, no.  But three points is three points.  Take the points, get your defense on the field, and try to get the ball back.  That’s how you win games."
Because opting out of participation in the system as it exists is not a workable solution. Tear it all down just leads to less for everyone. We need a better plan for a conversion from personal liberty first to egalitarianism foremost. USA's Gini Coefficient used to be twenty basis points lower. We can get back to that.
"Depends on your definition of liberal. Liberal as in mainstream Democrat, sure, they obviously don’t want to usher in significant change. Myself, I lean more toward the “radical” leftist ideology that allows for strong social welfare programs and the dismantling of our corrupt and failing system in favor of something more akin to a parliamentary democracy. Ditch the 2 party system and divide the representation out among a variety of factions. Forced concession and cooperation would help to keep the currently elected faction in check"
"Because it's ""consensus,"" ""unity,"" ""bipartisanship"" and ""reaching out"" to not stand for the things they claim to stand for, and then blame it on ""incrementalism"" and ""the political will not being there."" 🙄"
"Well that's an economic issue, not a social issue"
So we should forget about social issues that because we’re not vocal enough about wealth disparity? How exactly would that help? And the democrats are trying to raise the minimum wage and make the rich pay taxes.
Most change happens rapidly.  Not incremental.  Obamacare was a way to prolong a failed private sector and really does not do much to fix it.  Just keeps it on life support
Or you could actually see the economic issues.  Push to change that system instead of ignoring it
"I agree that parliamentary democracies work better than our two-party system.  However, they have their own dysfunction when a coalition government doesn't happen easily."
Well seems to bleed into social issues don't you think?
If the economic system is designed to reward the exploitation of those in need how many social issues can you really fix?  At best you can change who will be exploited but all your social causes will always be superficial.  Kind of like how we could end chatel slavery but just replaced it with prison slavery.  We still have slavery just a different face.
">So we should forget about social issues that because we’re not vocal enough about wealth disparity? 

How about drawing attention to both? Economic issues influence social issues a lot. 

>And the democrats are trying to raise the minimum wage and make the rich pay taxes.

Which does absolutely nothing to combat the inherent exploitation in the current economic system."
"To be sure. No system is perfect, but I think it would be a big step in the right direction"
"Well, if you're asking why people support an economic system, it probably has something to do with believing in the economic principles.  Seeing x or y issue arise doesn't change that.  They try to alleviate it through policy just like any other system.  

The other reason is being very skeptical how or if another system would work at all, let alone work better."
But the economic system rewards exploitation.  It would be like arguing not to switch from feudalism and just alliavate its inherit flaws with policy.
The situations aren't the same.  We are in a system that is post feudalism and talking about a system we haven't experienced being less exploitative or better ethically.
DeSantis is the new Trump. The more successful he becomes within the GOP the madder it will make Trump. A mad Trump will likely run as an independent if the money is right.

Florida has a free dictator
"He's the new trump.  Definitely smarter, but also more extreme if that possible."
The truth is what they say it is.  People need to realize that in America truth isn't bound by facts anymore.
Well not those people of course.
"Honestly, I could see a SC ruling in DeSantis's favor backfiring horribly on conservative media. Imagine if Fox News or Newsmax could be sued for spreading misinformation."
Liberal media is forced to make a lot of retractions on articles as well
Yeah they only want freedom for their speech
With that guy you don't need to spread a false propaganda. He's a wannabe fascist dictator.
"It depends on if you think everything that goes against your ideology is false.

You either believe in freedom from government interference in your speech or you don’t. Just be clear about it."
But not as creative.  Or not as bizarre.  Possibly the same thing.
Making retractions is what makes them liberal. “Conservative” media just allows the lies to roll on downhill.
"Funny, I think you just proved the point - they own up to their mistakes, and actually issue a retraction. That's called integrity. When was the last time Tucker Carlson admitted that he was wrong about anything?"
Is this a surprise to anyone?
I would call it disinformation because it’s intentional.
"If congress declares war on Russia (or if Russia declares war on the US) the Biden administration can rightfully and legally shut down Bannon, fox and all the other misinformation sources as weapons/tools of the enemy. 

On the other side of that, a republican administration could shut down all sources of truthful information. 

Just something to think about for 2024."
Who would believe Gin Blossom?
"This submission has been randomly featured in /r/serendipity, a bot-driven subreddit discovery engine. More here: /r/Serendipity/comments/1101jlr/steve_bannons_podcast_is_top_misinformation/"
"No one does.  People who listen just like to be told that they’re right, and they are the victims who will be vindicated."
"Recognize that there are people in the world who aren’t you. 

Those people have value and are deserving of respect and assistance."
"Recognize that our country is a melting pot of cultures BY DESIGN and none of those cultures are superior to any other. 

Recognize that everyone's monetary gains are a function of the opportunity the entire system provides and that in order for communities to survive, resources must be shared. Especially to those least able to accumulate them. 

Dignity. Everyone deserves it."
Try to be kind and considerate of everyone.
We have way less Nazis?
"If you need convincing, you aren’t paying attention."
">In short, try to convince me?

Primarily, you have to believe in equal rights for everyone. That everyone has equal value as a human being.

That you should not need to be convinced of. 

And most everything else tends to build off of that. Although I would say liberals tend to also believe that we can often do things better together. Rather than always embracing a ""pull you up by your own bootstraps"" mentality which is common among conservatives."
I don't think it's a club with rules. You're either liberal or not.
Make all your votes and political support for candidates that believe in democratic government that works. People who want government to work for the people who created it are liberals. People who believe government is an obstacle for humanity are selfish reactionaries that belief might makes right.
"I’m for saving the planet (the environment) and helping poor , middle class and marginalized people. That’s my main issues I care about."
Value human life and sustaining it.
"To be blunt and short: everyone should be treated the same, everyone should have the same, everyone should contribute to ensure sustainability, and we are right."
"Learn to cohabitate with others. Use logic and skepticism to build your frame of reference; create a well being based common sense, morality and sense of justice. Opt to be kind and happy each day. Enrich your vocabulary and know the dictionary definition of each word you use, you will learn that kindness is not a synonym of weakness.

You do this, no one will have to convince you."
"Much of it is hardwired. Conservatives have overactive amygdalas, which causes exaggerated fear responses
This causes them to value order over equity, and it probably can't be changed. 

Look on the bright side, though: life isn't eternal. You'll only have to be a conservative for a few decades or so."
"Have a brain, and use it"
"Government is how we get things done together. It's not always exactly what we want. It's not always the most efficient way. When people follow the rules, though, it gets things done. Like roads and bridges, a social safety net, food safety, etc. I could go on for hours."
"Treat people the way you want to be treated. I just turned 55 years old, and this basic precept has served me well to date."
You either care for other humans and believe they all deserve equal rights or you don’t. If you don’t you’re a conservative. If you do then you’re a liberal.
"""Convincing"" you to switch sides isn't really how it works. Being on the left is about having morals regardless of any religious views. They can be separate, you don't need one to get the other. But, here are some of my views:

Learn that anything that goes against a narrow mindset is not something that should be instantly demonized.

Learn and teach history as it happened and not through rose-colored glasses. Don't be afraid to learn that your ancestors might have done bad things.

The job of a politician is not to obstruct the opposing party to the detriment of your constituents.

EDIT: Just found one instance that might convince someone. The Wyoming State Legislature has a bill going through that puts a minimum age of 16 on child marriage. Right now a child can get married at any age in Wyoming. The State GOP is outraged over the possibility of limiting religious liberty. While only 3% of child marriages involve a child younger than 16. If that isn't a common sense reason to switch sides, I don't know what is."
"What an interesting question.  Honestly I never thought about a person trying to figure out how to be liberal.  I don't think there is a class.  Being liberal is so deeply rooted in beliefs that we are all better when we work together for the good of all.  This country was on this path then greed took over. 

 This liberal believes education should teach critical thinking, another words teach kids how to solve problems not teach them what to think.  They are the future and the problems they face we will not have a clue how to solve.  Religion will not fix the future, hating others because they do not look like you or think like you will not fix the future.  Guns and war will not fix the future.

This liberal believes we have to come together to save the planet.  Love is the answer as corny as that may sound.  Love our fellow humans, animals and the environment."
"For example in an ideal world, do you see everyone competing against each other, or working together?

Do you think it’s right for someone early in life to get a sickness they can’t afford and need to die because of it?

Also as an economist, I look at it this way: full employment for the world is unrealistic 
For example one quote I heard that I like was someone asking the Chinese leader what keeps him awake at night, he said having to create 1 million new jobs every month.

Keep in mind world population over last 100 years has gone from 1.9 billion to 7.9 billion and the earth will continue for more than next 10000 years. Do you think it’s the best plan for everyone to be competing or working together? Do you think we will have a global employment rate of 95%+ forever competing? 
Add on to that robots are advancing so the need for humans doing jobs should go down and automation should go way up.

I don’t think the best way forward is everyone competing against each other"

That goes for every political identity..

">In short, try to convince me? To be a liberal, if that makes sense.

No.  Either you are liberal or your not.  Read posts here and if you agree, great, if not also great.  Just be respectful or other people."
What ideas would make the world a better place to live in? Then figure out what we need to do to accomplish it? Politically? Education? Literature?
"Yup. Liberalism is a result of empathy and imagination. Having empathy for others and being able to imagine what it would be like for them.

It's why it's so frustrating to see someone come around on an issue when it directly impacts them. Like a conservative coming around on gay marriage when their kid comes out. If you're unable or unwilling to imagine what it's like to be in another position it might take you or someone close to you being effected by it to open your eyes. From the liberal perspective we want that without it directly impacting ourselves."
Pretty much this. Instead of looking around to see how much everybody else got check and make sure everybody got enough.

">Liberalism is a result of empathy and imagination. Having empathy for others and being able to imagine what it would be like for them.

Which is why it's always strange to me that they're are so many Christian conservatives. When Jesus had so much empathy for others."
Good comment.
"Christianity as a cultural entity has been about control and authority since its inception. Yes, Jesus sounds pretty great but the organization that uses his name is focused on control. Authority and control are key aspects of the conservative mentality."
"Oh, I get all that.

But the sheer amount of hypocrisy is astounding. Jesus is about is liberal as anyone can be. And yet we have more conservative Christians in the US than liberal Christians."
Can they plead the fifth this time? If so this is all pointless. No one is going to answer the important questions if they don't have to. The right thing to do is make sure Trump and his minions are held accountable but power and politics are more important to these clowns. Pence did the right thing ONCE!!
This is what like the 5000 person who’s been subpoenaed while investigating Trump?
"u/Any-Variation4081

You mentioned:

>>*Can they plead the fifth this time? If so  is all pointless. No one is going to answer the important questions if they don't have to. The right thing to do is make sure Trump and his minions are held accountable but power and politics are more important to these clowns. Pence did the right thing ONCE!!*

If you are given immunity? You can't plead the 5th.

There are two types of immunity: (1) transactional immunity (total immunity) and (2) use and derivative use immunity.

■ Transactional Immunity

>*Also known as total immunity, transactional immunity provides a shield against any future charges based on any matter related to the testimony. (The prosecution still can bring charges against the witness for matters that are unrelated to the testimony.) The federal criminal justice system does not offer transactional immunity, but many states do.*

■ Use and Derivative Use Immunity

>*This comes with more restrictions and thus is more often offered by prosecutors. Use and derivative use immunity protects the witness from having the prosecution use their statements or any evidence discovered from their statements against them. Essentially, this produces the same result as if the witness invoked their Fifth Amendment privilege and did not testify at all. It allows the prosecution to bring charges based on the same crime against the witness, as long as the charges are based entirely on independent evidence from a different source. Whether that evidence is sufficient to convict the witness without using their statements can be left to a judge or jury to decide.*

If you accept immunity and refuse to testify? Or try to plead protection under the Fifth Amendment?

 You could be held in contempt of court.

>*An individual who refuses to testify after being awarded immunity can be held in contempt of court and possibly jailed.*

And? Like you said? VP Pence did the right thing once.

Would he do it again?

Maybe if he was given immunity? 

He doesn't seem to want to say anything against disgraced one term twice impeached former President Trump.

For some unknown reason.

I've been seeing this same headline with slight variations and different people for eight damn years now...
"Thank goodness former VP Pence has been subpoenaed.

Otherwise? I don't think __he would have made an appearance.__  

>*Former Vice President Mike Pence has been subpoenaed by the special counsel investigating Donald Trump and his role in January 6, 2021*

The memoir VP Pence wrote will be a problem for disgraced one term twice impeached former President Trump and his enablers, minions, sycophants, and lackeys.

>*Depending on his responses, prosecutors have the option to ask a judge to compel him to answer additional questions and override Trump's executive privilege claims.*

It's been __more than two years.__ 

Everybody's knowledge is like swiss cheese - there are holes in it. The longer we wait to hear the memories and testimony from key witnesses? 

More time will pass, and people might start to forget - conveniently.

>*The subpoena marks an important milestone in the Justice Department's two-year criminal investigation, now led by the special counsel, into the efforts by Trump and allies to impede the transfer of power after he lost the 2020 election. Pence is an important witness who has detailed in a memoir some of his interactions with Trump in the weeks after the election, a move that likely opens the door for the Justice Department to override at least some of Trump's claims of executive privilege.*

IMO? The memoir makes it easy to open the door on specific incidents related to the times before, during, and after 6 January.

I wonder if VP Pence wrote the nook with full knowledge that his written words could be an important part of the 6 January investigations?

Likely so.

>*In November, Pence published his memoir that detailed some of his interactions with Trump as the former president sought to overturn the results of his election loss to President Joe Biden. Pence and his team knew that the book's publication would raise the prospect that the Justice Department would likely seek information about those interactions as part of its criminal investigation, people briefed on the matter told CNN.*

Other members of disgraced one term twice impeached former President Trump’s inner circle are being compelled to testify.

>*Pence rebuffed an interview request from the House select committee that investigated the January 6 insurrection, but allowed top aides to provide testimony in the House's probe, as well as in the Justice Department's criminal investigation. The DOJ successfully secured answers from top Pence advisers Greg Jacob and Marc Short in significant court victories that could make it more likely the criminal investigation reaches further into Trump's inner circle.*

The Republican Party *currently supports* autocracy, bribes, bullying, cheating, control of a woman's body, dismantling the US Constitution, fascism, fear, fraud, hatred, insurrectionists, racism, stealing top secret government documents, white supremacy, __pursuit of alternative facts (lies)__ and grifting.

I've been thinking about this since 6 January:

■ Someone who openly appeals to the worst of us to ""ditch the US Constitution"", should be instantly __barred from holding any political office in perpetuity.__

■ When our officials take the oath of office, they have to promise to protect the US Constitution. If they want to destroy the US Constitution? How can they take the oath of office?

Let's see if Special Counsel Jack Smith  can poke a hole in it for America.

The snowball of criminal activity and abhorrent behavior is running downhill, gaining momentum and debris along the way. 

Far surpassing anything any one of us could ever have imagined."
Can't we just be honest already and call it what is it: Going through the motions.

"I don't understand the zhe-zher or xe-xim pronouns and whatnot. I get the Trans and nonbinary, but going up and down the alphabet seems pointless and attention-begging. Identities are a real thing, but making up your own pronouns that you want others to use seems pointless."
"Sometimes the ""Super Woke"" (For lack of a better term.) can get a little annoying and overboard and end up hurting their cause."

Universal health care for all would be great, but one still needs to exclude niche expensive operations."
"I completely agree with the amount we spend on our military.

Abortion should be banned
"Minimum wage should somehow tie in and match inflation. It should increase each year by a small percentage. I will never support the idea of practically doubling it at one time. That sounds like a good idea at first but all it will eventually cause is an increase in prices, lower hours and less full time employees so many businesses can make up the difference. And also it will completely screw over people that have jobs that are within that wage range currently. I don't see why many other liberals don't realize this or don't seem to care. 

That and the whole oppression Olympics, intersectionality identity politics that has become too prevalent on the left. It does more harm than good to most causes. 

Also Kamala Harris sucks."
"I'm on the fence with gun rights and abortion rights. I also think a lot of women who are self-proclaimed feminists are not actually egalitarian and are actually just angry and shitty. Same thing with lots of other minority groups. 

But I don't really see that as conservative. But sometimes conservatives think I'm agreeing with them. It really matters how you get there. Not saying that that makes a difference on the outcome. I'm saying it makes a difference on your motivations and your values and your own sense of security.

People who are insecure or feel unsafe, will attack others sometimes. And I think a lot of conservative thinking is based on insecurity. Whereas my thinking is based more on observation and rationality. So the outcome would be different if somebody were to listen to me versus if they were to listen to a conservative even if we both might be on the fence about gun rights.

Because a conservative is going to say something absurd like yelling nonsense about shooting people if they ever step on their lawn.

Whereas I would say something more along the lines of how I think guns escalate situations, but at the same time they are a tool that has a use."
"No gun should be banned, and traditional marriage should stay..

"Honestly I agree 100%. I think the multitude of pronouns that aren’t apart of traditional English are quite fucking ridiculous. I support identifying your pronouns as necessary, with regards to one’s gender identity, but I don’t see a necessity for anything beyond he/him/his, /their/theirs/them/they, or her/hers, etc .. the shit is stupid otherwise and I’ll stand on that hill."
Yup - I started rolling my eyes when we kept pushing “no labels” in the gay community and we literally have LGBTQIA+++ or whatever it is now.
"I think a lot of people misunderstand the motivation behind pronouns. Pronouns are about self-identity. How do you identify yourself? So, these people who are using these pronouns, they are exploring their own self identity. So, there's no real reason why anybody should have a problem. It's like if somebody else died their own hair green. There's no reason why anyone should have anything to say about it. It's their hair not anyone else's"
I don’t even know what this is.  I guess I’m getting old.
"I chalk some of that up to youth and emotion, and sometimes that emotion gets in the way of logic -- this aim to be ""pure"" becomes so obsessive they can't see the forest for the trees. If they continue to evolve and age in those values, I'd like to think that with maturity, they can still keep true to their beliefs and causes but moderate their own emotions a bit."
YES. yes.
"Yeah I think the left has turned into as much of a mob as the right wing has. It seems like they just want to Lynch people.

I think it's just a progression of events. 10 years ago, conservatives kept attacking ""sjws"" online. And usually sjw's were actually not doing anything wrong. But because the American culture supports Petty shitty behavior, the bullies attacking liberals were not shut down like they should have been.

But of course the social justice Warriors had righteous conviction on their side. Like, if you see somebody committing a crime and you know it's wrong, just because somebody calls you a mean name doesn't mean you're going to stop standing up for a victim. So, both sides in this conflict kept up their perspective. The social justice Warriors kept trying to be activists and their critics continued to try and Bully them.

So, people who weren't really social justice Warriors and weren't really bullies either, felt the need to join in one way or the other. And so we ended up with these Petty ""normal"" people joining the causes of the social justice warriors. So, they ended up taking over and now the left has got this lynching mob that goes from celebrity to celebrity trying to cancel everybody. And I mean, a lot of the times they're not wrong. I mean JK Rowling is kind of being a jerk about trans people. But then to call her anti-semitic because her goblins run banks? That is really a stretch. There's no evidence that she's doing that as a reference to Jewish people. And that's just one example. Where they're just trying to completely Lynch somebody socially just because they make one mistake."
"""transgender"" what? Who exactly? You mean transgender WOMEN?"
Yeah I agree. And I think it's a shame that people are trying to pretend like this is some kind of controversial perspective. I'm certain there are plenty of trans women who know that they do not belong in cid women's sport categories.

"That was never a conservative opinion. That's an insult to anyone who's not conservative. It's saying that everyone else has no sense of money. Which is just a blatant insult.

I think it's also a false dichotomy. They were trying to find a positive trait to give to each party's because people were asking why we have this stupid two-party system. And they're saying that oh this group is all about money and this group is all about human rights.


And in reality everyone on the left is just as capable of making sensible economic choices. And probably more so especially nowadays because being more concerned about money than human rights is not a sensible perspective"

But it's certainly fair to respect the police who are doing a good job, and not respect where police are not being required to do so."
"Yeah I don't really support the police but I can't exactly express that to a cop. That would be idiotic and it would be asking for trouble. Whenever I'm friendly to them they usually let me go. But maybe it's because I'm white. Like for instance one time I got pulled over for having a headlight out and I was completely drunk. (This was like 20 years ago). And the cop just let me go because I was friendly with him. And one time I swerved because I was texting and the cop just let me go because I was friendly. One time a cop caught me with weed and he just let me go because I was friendly with him.

But I'm white and these were all white cops. So maybe that has something to do with it.

But yeah if you're ever going to get in a fight with somebody you should expect to win. Otherwise why the hell are you asking to lose a fight? So I don't really understand why people are always trying to fight the cops. If you're going to fight the cops you have to be certain that you can kick his ass."

"It is not always a bad thing to have diversity/inclusive quotas for education and employment.

For example, in education, when students are only ever in classes with people like themselves, they tend not to become familiar with people in other groups. This can lead to racism and bigotry. As well as just a general lack of respect for other subcultures. People from other groups also sometimes bring different opinions which help to create a better environments to foster critical thinking.

Same with employment. Employers can often benefit from having a diversity of ideas, which can often come from a diversity of people.

That being said, affirmative action type policies tend to create hostility and resentment. Because lack of socioeconomic opportunity is often the cause as to why some groups are underrepresented, we could shift to affirmative action based on socioeconomic status. And so more politically savvy, and it would also be inclusive of people who needed more opportunity who are in majority groups."
"The quotas shouldn't be blatant and blank. They should account for context and nuance. Like, we shouldn't be lowering standards in order to meet the quota.

I think that is the main problem. We should not be lowering standards in order to meet a quota."

I think you both have a good point. And I don't think there's anything wrong with two opposing perspectives both having a good point.

I think mostly the high military spending talking point is used to argue against conservative ideology. Because conservatives will say that we don't have enough money, but then they never bat an eye at military spending. So it's not actually that we don't have money, it's that they don't value human rights. Which is fascism."

I'm in a better place than I was, but I won't own one for my own safety."
I’ve had people get mad at me over unnecessarily misgendering them. This is first world feminism. Which I support. But we shouldn’t neglect women of the third world who actually face physical mutilation.
"Nobody has ever identified as mayonnaise. Many many people have identified as women and as men. So to compare transgender people to something that nobody has ever identified as, that is making trans people sound insane. There's nothing insane about talking about your own gender. But to say that your mayonnaise would be insane. To say that you don't align with the gender that you are assigned is not insane. But what you said is transphobic because of that. But I do understand that you're just making an argument and you're not trying to be anti-trans. But maybe you are a little and you don't realize that. Because you compared a sound, sane argument to something that is insane."
"Some can have ideas that almost sound prejudiced at times. For example, some consider a non Hispanic person who makes tacos for their own personal consumption to be committing ""Cultural Appropriation"" 

The most out there that makes my blood boil are those who consider a white person who sleeps, dates, or marries a non-white person to be ""Fetishising"" someone. It makes me angry as someone engaged to a Hispanic man. It makes me feel as if they are trying to invalidate the love my man and I have had for nearly a decade."

"Ok. I also think it is fear mongering from the conservatives. Some kids know they're gay. If you ask LGBT people, a lot of them knew they were LGBT as kids because they would have a crush on other kids.  

So there are some parents who are just fine with accepting their kids when they say stuff like that. And conservatives have warped it to try and make it the most extreme sounding issue."

These straight guys can suddenly not be they/them or gender fluid or whatever. I will always be gay. 

You don’t get to ride on the coat tails of the real struggle gays and lesbians have had to fight through. You don’t get a free pass because you are asexual today and non-binary tomorrow and you want to legitimize your selfish movement by saying we are all part of the same community. We are not.

Second, no one determines gender by the size of the gametes. This is just stupid. Sex is determined at north by whether the baby has a penis or a vagina. This his always been the case. Gametes were unknown until the invention of the microscope. Humans have been around much longer than that. Ref: homunculus.

Abortion isn't in the Bible?
The right wing supremes don't need a basis.  The bible tells them so.
Nope it's all theory.
"People like to act that way, but typically federal supreme court both sides vote the same on most issues. I am pro-choice, but right to privacy makes no sense for why abortions should be protected. At best it just means gov doesn't have right to know whether abortion occured doesn't mean one can't regulate it or outlaw it as absurd as that is."
"I agree, the 14th amendment's usage was pretty twisty, but I'm still pro-choice..
Even if it's something I agree with, it sounds to me like a corrupt action.. 

'_' 3rd, 4th, and 5th amendments seem more about privacy than the 14th anyway"
It makes a lot of sense.   The fourth amendment makes it clear that you have the right to privacy.   So what you medically share with your doctor is a choice you make not the government.
"One has a right to privacy in ones home too, but that doesn't mean if one does anything in the home it is protected. Gov can get a subpoena for instance and raid a home. No reason to think abortion is any different. One has right of privacy with doctor, but if something is done illegally gov can request info and prosecute. Not sure why you think right to privacy somehow means abortion rights. This is especially true if at a point in time of pregnancy one is killing the equivalent of a child. Privacy would not override that or anything considered illegal. It would simply mean gov expects X crime done and based on a specific threshold is allowed to acquire said info from medical providers. One should not conflate wanting a desired outcome with it means the method makes logical sense.

Personally I am of the mindset gov should not be able to make laws against rights unless they can provide sufficient proof justifying the overriding of the right. E.g. yelling fire in crowded theatre. I do not see how abortion would meet such a threshold when one can not even prove the fetus is the equivalent of an alive baby at a particular stage of pregnancy."

It's terrible or such a divided country and it's terrible it's somebody like Ron DeSantis can be so hateful
"I work in VA, live in NC and yet another scary thing is other Republicans are emboldened by this nonsense. Youngkin in VA. seems to be acting like DeSantis light, trying to rewrite history and removing anything that makes America look not so perfect and the NC legislature just passes a bill forcing teachers to out Transgender students.  Encourage your peers to scream sanity and vote these hate mongers out."
Do you have a non paywalled article? Preferably a Floridian source?
The former junior senator from Nebraska will not be happy if that’s the case.
"and more scary that we are always being assaulted with his ~~bologna~~ baloney.  the fact that people are into this snake oil hate mongering is just crippling my brain. this is not playing out well for the majority of rational americans that expect human rights, equitably, a voice, and safety from growing domestic terrorists cells being lead by government officials."
At least Youngkin has a Democratically controlled Senate to deal with that keeps him from going overboard.

">The first amendment hasn't been changed, nor should it.

It actually should be. It needs to explicitly state that speech that is intended to disrupt a democracy and/or harm others can be restricted by law.

Otherwise, a very conservative Supreme Court could allow speech that should not be protected. For example, they could legitimize hate speech.

And, we should have laws preventing baseless claims about elections being stolen."

"Republicans have wanted to gut Social Security and Medicare ever since they started.

One thing often overlooked: Donald T**** suspended the FICA tax that largely funds Social Security.

He said if reelected he will make it permanent.

No less a ""liberal bastion"" than Forbes magazine said that would dry SS/Medicare up in about it three years."
That’s stupid. Have one retirement age (65-70) with payments inflation indexed. Tax all income instead of allowing the rich to avoid payroll taxes over $160k.
Next stop...The return of the poor house and treadmills...
"I could smell it when Rick Scot (that reptile) came out with it:

&#x200B;

They say that SS & Medicare are doomed because of the debt. Then when millions threaten to lynch them, they shrug and say, ""well, we have to do something, we're going bankrupt."" Then they unleash the idea of ""saving social security"" by privatizing it. Then they have achieved their dream of getting all the tax money in their hands -to skim as they see fit. HhahHahhahahahahahahahahah!"
"“If it talks like a Republican, it’ll probably kill you.”"
Always remember :  The people with most of the money want ALL of the money.
"This is the kind of thing that on the one hand upsets me about paying into social security at all. That not only will I never see it, but my kids will never see it, and even those older than me are about to lose it. But on the other hand, if everybody voted based on that fear, it would become a self fulfilling prophecy, we would collectively end it because we are fearful it I’ll go away anyway, so we would just be yanking out the tooth we fear we might lose. 

But what is worse? To keep paying into it so Wall Street can eventually take it? Or to just end it so people can keep their income and not give it to Wall Street to plunder later. Once it’s withdrawn as FICA, it’s forever at the whim of these lobbyists.  

Ideally we want to save it, but it must be making many people nervous because clearly there is no safety net or legal guard rail that prevents these kinds of modifications. It isn’t really a trust after all. As long as any shenanigans like this can happen, we are faced with funding it and hoping it won’t be tampered with, or ending it so we can just keep more of the paycheck. That’s a devils bargain. The only solution is to somehow make it inviolable. But that’s apparently not what it is yet, and if it’s not by now, how do we ever make it so?"
"I don’t support that plan, but I could get behind putting 1% of new revenue into the trust fund into broad US stock market index funds like the Vanguard S&P 500 and a Russel 2000 fund, just to hold.  Over thirty to forty years, the growth in dividends should be an excellent addition to the funding.  

Oh and cut the FICA tax rate and eliminate the cap on eligible earnings for FICA taxes."
Great line!
"We should fund it and never vote for the jackals that want to plunder it ever for the rest of time.  (Or until we implement something better, not possible in the current political climate, rife with greed as it is, but we are all hoping to get to star trek someday.)"
"Yeah. imagine what it’s like to be forced to do a continuing disability review, which is their little ploy, to intimidate disabled people into dropping their benefits. They also use other techniques, such as changing the diagnosis of the patient by only allowing the patient’s disability to be defined by, some unrelated diagnosis that prevents them from getting any medical care in future. 

Then, if the patient ask questions, they’re banned from going to Social Security offices, and if the Social Security office has the website down, people with impairments, that only allowed text based communication are out of luck. Social Security also goes after recipients of previous benefits and tries to force them to pay them back. It’s really scary and frankly, many people are suicidal over this."
Maybe if it were original. . . It's a play on a Ronald Reagan quote.
It was just me expressing my concerns and articulating what I think are many peoples fears. My last paragraph described an ideal that you literally restated a different way. But ok.

"South Carolina Democratic Rep. James Clyburn funneled six figures worth of campaign cash to two of his family members throughout the 2022 election cycle, filings show.

The longtime congressman's campaign largesse included forking tens of thousands of dollars over to a company linked to his son-in-law. He also sent nearly $100,000 to his grandson, Federal Election Commission records show.

**While it's legal for federal politicians to pay family members from their campaigns, ethics experts have generally disapproved of the practice. Despite this, both political parties have taken advantage of the perk**.

Clyburn's family payments the last election cycle include $57,500 to 49 Magnolia Blossom LLC for rent expenses, filings show. That company has close ties to his daughter, Jennifer Clyburn Reed.

According to South Carolina business records, Clyburn Reed's husband, Walter A Reed, is the registered agent of the limited liability company.

Clyburn also paid out $94,000 to his grandson Walter A.C. Reed during the midterm election cycle for ""campaign management fees,"" his filings further show"

He waited until it was over water before it was taken down so that way it wouldn’t do any damage on land- that’s not responding late- it’s called being responsible 😂
You can't shame the shameless. They're quite proud of being hypocrites.
Republicans blame uncle joe for the sun rising
"""What do we do? Walk it back? Apologize?""  
""Can that noise, jack...We didn't get where we are by being truthful or sincere. We'd lose our base. Time to double-down!"""
"I BET HE ALSO USES DIJON. FAKE PANIC, EVERYONE! GUARD YOUR GAS STOVES! OBAMA IS COMING TO TAKE ALL YOUR GUNS! THESE THINGS ARE GUARANTEED TO HAPPEN UNLESS THEY DON'T! FUCKS NEWS!"
Republicans are looking for anything to be upset about Biden that they let Trump get away with.
I don't pay attention to Republicans they are anti-america anti women anti women of color they are anti-Semitic and they have no respect for America so they get no respect from me
"maybe Trump didn't know?  I mean, he didn't attend security briefings..."
"Conservatives  putting the ""Jerk"" back into knee-jerk conservative"
That graphic is perfect for this story!

"Love it, always bring it back to Trump!"
ZERO proof lol 😆
"You can be sure that this balloon was known to NORAD as soon as it entered North American airspace. The only reason it wasn't immediately shot out of the sky is because the military deemed it unnecessary.

&#x200B;

Same scenario likely holds true for the previous balloons, though the information looks like it never made it to the higher echelons of the previous administration - probably because they knew it'd be moot to try and get Trump to understand it."
"We elected biden to be better than trump. Not on the same level as. 

He fucked up. He should have responded sooner than he did. 

If he chose to do something as soon as this was spotted this would be a non story."
It’s Obama’s fault.
Plus I read where they jammed it electronics long before it was shot down.
"From what I read, on Wednesday, Biden told the military to shoot it down as soon as they judged it was safe to do so.  The military decided to wait until it moved off shore where they could shoot it down without risk to anyone/anything on the ground.  It also gave them more time to monitor the balloon and any emissions it was making.  


The water depth is less than 50 feet where it splashed down so they should be able to recover the hardware for research."
Probably could of been taken down over the mid-west safely when they first detected it if they timed it right. But what information is China gonna get from a balloon that isn't available on Google Maps or their many satellites.
They thank Chump for the sun rising and blame Biden when it sets

WELL IF JOHN BOY - WHO WAS IN OFFICE FOR THE LAST 6 MOTHS OF TRUMP'S WHITE HOUSE OCCUPATION SAYS IT-- THEN IT MUST BET TRUE--LOL"
"> He fucked up. He should have responded sooner than he did.

UMM--THENTHERE WOULD BE NO PROOF THAT IT WAS A WEATHER BALLON AND NOT A SPY ONE

now the united states has all of the data and the tracking, no one on the gound was hurt and America has the technology and the evidence , shooting it down before would have left holes in the evidence argument

ALSO WHY IS IT A STORY NOW THAT ITS FLOATED OVER DURING THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WHEN IT FLOATD OVER 3 TIMES DURING THE TRUMP YEARS WITHOUT A PEEP FROM FOXS NEWS AND/OR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY?

lol"
The military managed this.
"No! It's Carter's fault!

LOL"
Ok- so that’s a minor hinderance. Biden still handled it responsibly- unlike the former president that allowed 3 of them to happen while he was in the White House. And didn’t do anything about it.
Thats an interesting question that hopefully can be answered by studying the wreckage.
"They wouldn't be able to tell it was a weather balloon if they shot it down? Come on man. They aren't nuking it man. The evidence would still be there. 

You're seriously asking why a right wing news organization didn't report on why a right wing president had spy balloons fly over the country? Are you new? 

Liberal media also didn't report on it."
And the head of the military is?
"I agree with you he did it right, jammed its systems until it was safe to shoot down."
"The defense dept, national security department and Trump all say it did not occur during his term."
I’m guessing they shot it down in a place where recovery was likely.
"True, but not much else can be done in high atmosphere, maybe infrared. Thinking about it, I'm not sure how well insulated nuclear launch silos are but that would have a ton of interference from the atmosphere and not much of a different reading than a satellite."
"If they shot it down over land, it'd probably fall on someone or something, plus it'd be much harder to tell what the balloon was for."
Exactly
True. As hard as conservative media is slamming Biden over this I would have expected the liberal one to have hammered Trump over it. But I don't remember a thing
"Presidents follow advice of military leaders, which he did"
"https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3287173/dod-statement-on-high-altitude-surveillance-balloon/

Official .gov site, I know it’s not “Truth” Social, so I’m sure you boot licking Trumpers won’t believe it."
"Of course. It's what the media does. Need to point out the flaws of the previous to make the current not so bad. 

We can't just say ""this shouldn't have happened, period """
They could have shot it down over Montana and it would have landed on nothing.
I see no claim of past Chinese spy balloons  flown over the US during Trumps term in the reference you posted. I have however found quotes from a number of past security officials who claim it hadn’t happened
"Instances of this kind of balloon activity have been observed previously over the past several years

Nothing in that article says there were spy balloons over the USA during any period prior to now. Just that they've seen balloons like these before and not even when."
"Yeah, that was always likely."
"You don't know that for sure. Balloons like that move at the speed of the wind and can change altitude to ride different currents. That means that they'd have to have cordoned off a wide fall zone within half an hour, and without having so much as a single Sheriff's Deputy thinking about Jade Helm 15 and going off the deep end. And that's assuming that such a wide stretch of land existed in the current flight path without any homes or significant property. Which, even for Montana, is farfetched."
"Also, you have no clue if I have ever been on truth social or my politics. Your attempt at an insult is amusing and naive."
"... it's Montana... Have you been to Montana? I have, the cows out number the people."
"Well, it could have killed Bubba’s cows."
You can't use reason to argue with someone who is unreasonable.
"There are no facts, statistics and tables are skewed.. welcome to our new political reality"
"They keep sharing this study showing that  most people who died from covid had other health conditions and only a low percentage of people without any other health conditions died from covid.  But really the study just confirmed people with a pre-existing condition are more likely to die from Covid (and most other diseases). Of course, they also all see themselves as perfectly healthy ignoring that the majority of Americans have pre-existing conditions like smoking, obesity, diabetes, high cholesterol, etc."
"It's not even tough.

Individually, it's hard to predict a person's behavior or health outcomes.

But when you gather that data and combine it with hundreds of millions of other people... Things get really predictable really quickly.

Death is the easiest thing to look for because we have a nice system in place to track it, Most deaths, it's usually pretty easy to know what somebody died of, and it's final.

So we know that the rate of deaths for the entire country for car accidents is x per 100,000 in January... The rate of deaths for cancer is y per 100,000 per year. etc, etc, etc. It doesn't change that much year to year. It just doesn't. It's frighteningly predictable.

And when you just look at all-cause death rates year after year, it's basically a metronome. So when you see your overall all-cause death rate spike right as a new thing that can kill people is happening, you can be pretty damn sure that the new thing that's killing people is the cause of those increased deaths, regardless of what it says on any death certificate.

People want to think they're individuals, and nobody can predict the future, and that they get fat because of their genetics, and that they're special because their mommy said so. But, at least when it comes to statistics... nobody's special.

What the heck do these people think a death certificate is FOR? If not to track what people in the country are dying of so as to try to stop those deaths that can be stopped?"
"If you had cancer and a bad immune system, then got Covid and couldn't breathe and then died, then you died of Covid. I have Diabetes and get every cold my Son brings home from school. If I get Covid, then I will die of Covid, not of Diabetes."
"A major complaint was that if those with pre-existing conditions had the most risk, then the burden of protection (restricting themselves from going out, mask wearing etc) would fall on them, not everyone else."
I do think a lot of them don't understand what a pre-existing condition is and that the majority of Americans have one. They think they are perfectly healthy when they are actually 30 pounds overweight and smoking a pack of cigarettes every day.
"I think the point is that it should fall upon the individual to decide, not someone else."
Try that with tuberculosis.
Treason is the Reason you’re in front of a firing squad.
"Okay so the franchise operator pays dues, they can lower those so the business can stay afloat.

You can say that Mcd's doesn't respect franchise owners if they don't make a lot while still paying below liveable wage.

Or you could use the argument that maybe, just maybe, Mcd's SHOULDN'T exist if they can't make money while paying a loveable wage. Maybe the company is just unsustainable. Maybe their billion dollar owners can just cut back on the avocado toast and 9 figure yachts, then they could maybe pay a liveable wage.

Sorry got into rant mode. I think the point stands though."
Not all McDonald's are franchises. Some are corporate owned.
"The average McDonalds rakes in right about 2 million a year. But can be more depending.  
how much the franchise owner has to pay McDonalds I am not sure.   
But the cost of maintaining, stocking with food/supplies and paying a restaurant full of employees is no where near a million dollars.   
Most people I know of that own a franchise restaurant own multiple as well.   
It is up to the franchise owner what they pay employees as far as I know.   
I dunno how to do the math on it all,but it seems a franchise owner of a McDonalds would be making way more than 150k a year."
"In my experience, most franchisees own multiple sites. If profits were so rotten, why would they do that?  


Any employer - large or small - that DOES NOT pay a living wage to their FTE - fulltime equivalent - workers is relying on the REST OF US to support them through public assistance programs. They are taking an 'under the table' cut on their taxes by forcing their workers onto programs that our taxes fund...food assistance, housing, Medicaid, etc.  
Any company who cannot pay a living wage ought to be billed for the public assistance costs used by their employees.   


This site says the 'average' McD's has revenue of $2.8M and clears $800K before rent. [https://www.franchisechatter.com/2022/09/22/fdd-talk-mcdonalds-franchise-costs-fees-average-revenues-and-or-profits-2022-review/](https://www.franchisechatter.com/2022/09/22/fdd-talk-mcdonalds-franchise-costs-fees-average-revenues-and-or-profits-2022-review/)"
"I would say that it's not up to employees to help Finance somebody's dream of owning a business. The owners should be working there if they can't afford to pay a living wage to regular employees.

Pay living wages or work a regular job like the rest of us. Business owners are not a special class of people, they can work too."
"Most restaurants are dependent on third party suppliers who have a stranglehold on supplies.  Franchises are no different, we need to end monopolies everywhere in the economy and break free small companies from large ones.  This doesn't mean they can't pay people a living wage."
"So it's OK for business owners to make a decent living while exploiting their employees? $15/hr, if full time is only $30K per year. These aren't high school kids working in fast food, nowadays. These are parents."
"Thank you all, you gave me so many aspects of the issue to consider."
"She's right, a lot of businesses don't make massive amounts of profits. The average profit margin of a restaurant location in the US [is between 3%-5%](https://www.synergysuite.com/blog/average-restaurant-profit-margin/), which seems to match the numbers you found.

Raising wages may be a good thing, but doing that would also require raising prices. There's no magic stash of money you can dip into to raise wages without raising prices too.

The good news is that McDonald's locations tend to spend around [20% of their revenue as wages](https://www.restfinance.com/restaurant-finance-across-america/that-mcdonalds-salary-study-gets-it-wrong/article_73fa494b-1784-5143-83bf-81a3cf8a5d81.html), so theoretically doubling wages would only result in a 20% increase in prices (all else being equal). It's doable, but you'd just need to figure out how much of a stomach customers would have for the price increase."
"Minimum wage increases are crushing small businesses. As an accountant that works with a number of restaurants and bars, this is a major concern. Either these businesses go under or we all get very comfortable paying $10 a beer."
We’ve raised the federal minimum wage 22x. It’s neither the solution or the curse both sides make it out to be. Some economists argue that raising the minimum wage artificially creates imbalances in the labor market and leads to inflation.
"This whole idea is the same concept when people talk about slumlords. Sorry if you can’t afford to pay your people a living wage then you shouldn’t own a business. Don’t own a property if you need other peoples money to stay afloat & struggle to upkeep the premises. These are investments, which comes with risks"
"That sounds like a more complicated pyramid scheme but with a lot of red tape.

Trickle-down sounds like a pyramid scheme but with a lot of red tape, I suppose 🤷🏻‍♂️"
"A relatively small percentage are company owned. In fact, as per McDonald's:

> Approximately 93% Of McDonald’s restaurants worldwide are owned and operated by independent local business owners.

Source:https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/franchising-overview.html"
97.27534% of all statistics are made up on the spot.
You reject the idea that they make that much solely because you don’t it costs that much to tuna restaurant? Do you have anything to back up that belief or just a gut feeling?
">The average McDonalds rakes in right about 2 million a year.

That's $2 million in _revenue_, not profit (actually $2.7 million is the average revenue of a McDonald's restaurant).

You'd need to subtract the cost of ingredients, cleaning, maintenance, rent,  labour costs, and finally your franchise royalties to find out how much profit they make.

It seems like after those expenses, the [average profit seems to be around $150,000](https://www.mashed.com/178309/how-much-mcdonalds-franchise-owners-really-make-per-year/) for a single location.

Obviously some locations will be more or less profitable than this, but this is what the average is."
Yes to this!!! Also I have NEVER known a poor or middle class person to own a McDonald’s or afford a franchise.
I think the pandemic killed small businesses & the economic fallout from 2020/2021 will be years to come. I knew many full time waiters making 70-90k   a year(which is way over my city’s median income) working at local restaurants & bars until 2020.
What are you talking about? The minimum wage has been the same since 2009-companies are just increasing wages to look good. Meanwhile housing costs have skyrocketed.
"That's not what a pyramid scheme is..

A pyramid scheme is when each layer of a pyramid is engaging in the same activity - making money primarily by signing new people onto the scheme, promising those new people the ability to make big bucks by signing even more people into the pyramid. This falls apart because once you get a few layers down, there's no longer a chance to make big bucks, since doing so would require more people than exist on earth to sign up to the scheme.

A franchised fast food restaurant doesn't do this, the franchiser sells branding, recipes, training, and a supply chain of ingredients, and the franchisee uses these things to sell food for profit. It's a perfectly sensible business model."
Wow I didn't know that!  Thanks for sharing that. Much apprish
"Well I worked in restaurants for around 20 years, including managing them so I have a good idea of what a an average restaurant takes in roughly.And secondly I looked up what the average McDonalds takes in yearly. So I applied something you clearly are not familiar with. Some basic logic and critical thinking and reasoning skills .Also when you are going to try and cut someone down, you might want to check your spelling and word usage skills, sport."
"That is based on owning one location. Most of the fast food places now are owned by small companies that have multiple brands and locations. Note I said most, not all.And people who tend to buy franchises usually are well off in the first place. For example, to get a McDonalds franchise, you have to have 500k in liquid assets, plus 45k in cash . You will also need the ability to purchase/lease wherever its going to be built  And its very hard to get a loan to purchase a restaurant franchise with out a high value  collateral, or already owning a demonstrably profitable business .So its people who own other business's  already who are generally buying franchise's."
Federal minimum wage has been the same. [Many states have increased theirs](https://www.paycor.com/resource-center/articles/minimum-wage-by-state/)
"That… makes sense.

But still, Trickle Down is just… not effective in growing anything but a rock to throw angrily at these glass houses that those shams built."

"Yeah, trickle-down is an example of half-understanding macroeconomics.

Both supply side and demand sides of the economy need to be strong for things to be stable and for everyone to be prosperous. Concentrating too much on one side just causes a lot of problems."
Her mother often spoke on her behalf. That poor young woman. Also making her watch them both die and leaving her to go last. The thought of how many children are brainwashed by extreme indoctrination makes me sick.

Who on earth sees their lives improved as a result of trump’s existence? Nobody at all. That’s who.
Homeschooled! Of course!
Conservatism is a cult.
Fuck the comments making light of this. These were obviously some really sick people. The daughter never stood a chance being brainwashed by them her whole life.
"How disgustingly greedy of the parents. In strict Christian beliefs, suicide is an irreversible denial from heaven. They ordered the deaths so the two parents were killed and eligible for eternal salvation but decided to literally have their child suffer eternally in hell because they wanted to escape an outcome they didn't like but didn't want to have to pay the price for it themselves. They literally sold their child's soul to the devil for Trump in their own eyes."
How pro-life of them.
This is so fucking dumb I’m pretty sure it qualifies for a Darwin Award
"Lies kill. 

Whether it’s by politicians, media, or religion - it’s all deadly."
Society failed these people. Politicians don’t realize that there are impressionable people that believe every lie coming out of their mouth. All of this misplaced rage and fear is unprecedented and it’s getting worse for some reason.
"Ah, so we're finally reaching the Heaven's Gate period of the GOP cult. Sad, but predictable."
"Was talking in another sub about the reasons I don't think a theocracy will happen, and then I see this post. Soldiers of God are willing to die for God, they are not willing to live for another cause, and this case kinda proves that."

Scary how cult like Trump supporters are.
Mental health is the main factor and concern here.
I guess there are three less conservative votes for 2024.

Sometimes the trash takes itself out.
So they're in hell now for committing suicide. Well done.
These people needed real medical attention and instead they killed themselves. Why did you post this?

"It still amazes me that they can look at people like Trump, and see good Christians.  I don't remember ever seeing reports of his attending church, like most presidents.  And his life has been unabashedly heathenistic.

"“There was more money in my paycheck though!”

Exactly!
Home schooling is too much isolation for children.
"I just finished American Cipher, about Beau Bergdahl.  ""homeschooled"" was on like page two.  I'm proud of myself that I kept reading."
"Also school of hard knocks, the bowling alley.  Its like a street education where your concerns about the liberal dinosaur hoax get verified by fellow bowling enthusiasts who are also amateur biblical paleontologists."
Agreed. C’mon people we need to be better humans.
No because suicide like this is not eligible for a Darwin.
"I can tell you that politicians know full well what they're doing. The rage is the byproduct of years of foreign psyops through social media. Fact is, people don't think critically and that's great for unpopular political parties. It's also great when trying to destabilize an adversary. There's a reason the signs are pointing to civil war.... that's what will eventually bring down this nation."
I believe that trump does realize the effect his words have on impressionable people and uses that to his advantage.  He has said as much in the past.
Yes they do realize and no they don’t care.
"I’m glad you said society. If they were still alive, they’d be labeled fascists and some would go so far as to wish this fate upon them. Once it’s said and done, what a tragedy, this brainwashing. A kind reminder not to dehumanize people regardless of opposing political belief."
"It's impossible to separate mental health from politics in this case, because the party they worshiped actively promotes just these sorts of paranoid delusions for their own benefit."

"They needed therapy and also they would be alive today if Donald Trump didn't lie to them. Lies have consequences.

This is so sad and it shows how little regard Trump has for his followers when he manipulates them with falsehoods. Obviously it will lead to people being hurt, and has done so repeatedly, but he isn't concerned about that, nor did he ever change course after seeing the trail of blood his lies left. 

&nbsp;

He truly is completely morally bankrupt"
Rhetoric they were feed killed them. Panic and hysteria continuing to bombard people from right wing sources are killing people. We must call it out.
You also don’t see the left getting into Qanon. The right’s platforms and personalities attract the kind of people who are prone to extremism.
What's the problem? I'm sending thoughts and prayers as we speak.
I don’t think they consider that riling up their base also weaponizes mental illness to the point that fragile people like this will straight up kill themselves because they believe it when somebody says the “woke mob” is planning to kill you because you believe in god.
Trump knows that he can mobilize an army of rubes by lying to them. He only does it to serve himself and doesn’t think about said rubes at all.
"We poors are not real people to them, just grist for the mill."
I think few people are beyond redemption and should be afforded a clear path the to exit of all that bullshit. If that weren’t the case I’d still be a Republican but somebody was cool to me once.
"Nope. I'll happily label the parents as fascists and say it's not sad at all they decided to give us the gift of their absence. The girl, however, is a victim of her parents."
"Let's also not forget that Covid is doing more than just killing- it's inflicting massive ***Morbidity*** (long-term illness and disease) on the population.

Like, we currently have more than 4 million Americans seriously affected by Long Covid.  More than 12 million Europeans, too, and over 60 million people worldwide.

**I'm one of them**.  Life completely ruined by Long Covid- and being too sick to finish grad school (second time, for more degrees) or even hold down a steady job, now.

And it's NOT my fault- **just as with many others, I was affected by the carelessness and irresponsibility of others:** in my case a roommate who refused to wear a mask when he had Covid (which he caught on a business trip) because ""you can't catch Covid twice"" (**you can, and I did.**  Not to mention my first Master's is in Virology and I told him that was bullshit- even sent him research articles on multiple Covid infections and waning of immunity over just a few months...)"
Whatever you say “liberal” person. The comments sound like suicide porn to me
"If politicians like Trump did consider it, would they care? The answer is clearly no"
"They consider it, hell it's part of the plan but usually their weaponized crazies kill others, not themselves. If these people hadn't killed themselves it would have been another mass shooting of people they are brainwashed to despise, like a synagogue, gay club, democratic party office or school. And it isn't an accident, it is the goal of stochastic terrorism and incitement."
"“I don’t think they consider that riling up their base also weaponizes mental illness to the point that fragile people like this will straight up…”

Yes Trump fully knows and doesn’t care at all. Trump loves the uneducated and easily gullible"
I think you're giving them far too much credit. Republicans put too much effort into deliberately hurting people for me to ever believe they'd be bothered by accidentally hurting someone.
Absolutely

This is just another tactic to get more voter financial support- like he hasn’t already been draining their pocket books. He obviously doesn’t learn anything about NOT going after frivolous lawsuits- it will get thrown out and he will get a slap on the wrist like he’s gotten every other time when he’s pulled these stunts for wasting the courts and taxpayers time and money. Which in all honesty should be considered a crime with as much as he’s been doing just that.
"I would tell him I want cash. Wouldn't  trust a check,or a bank transfer. I wa t cash."

Why are you watching Newsmax to know what goes on over there is my question lol

I can relate. I used to only watch Fox News out of the cable news options and I'd watch it daily. Some of my friends thought I was conservative because I'd watch it. But it wasn't out of enjoyment in a normal way. It was out of a perverse enjoyment. The more angry and mad the hosts got at Obama the more I'd get off on it. I still watch Fox after elections when Democrats win which is basically every election since 2016 and it is so delicious.
"You realize you are giving yourself a fatal condition by doing this, yes?"

I wonder if MAGAts hate-watch CNN and MSNBC. (Asa liberal,  I rarely watch them. It's not information the majority of time; it's entertainment. It's nice to nod in an echo chamber, but juicier to see the other side go nuts. PS I'm terrible.)

I'd wager the liberal cable networks are in the media diets of some never-Trumpers, but the jury is out on whether the MAGA crowd has the discipline for brief tolerance or nose-pinching."

"Article I, Section 6:

> The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States. They shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place."
"I think that they should be target more for fraudulent gain e.g. when someone tosses in that old email are being evaluated then if it can be proven that there is no other reason for this other than political gain, then that action should be treated as one would with a similar set of actions when share trading.

Relevant people are taking ""slander"" action with voting machines and I hope they win with that. What happened with Alex Jones is also a good step in the right direction but ""Slander"" is a difficult concept to work with. That doesn't mean that it should be utilised but there are a range of negative concepts e.g. slander, fraud, etc. that should be used in a legal setting.

The last thing to remember is that it is a core axiom for the GOP and their supporters that they don't care about whether what they believe and tell others is true or not. While this does fit with ""Slander"", legally it is difficult to apply in a meaningful manner that produces tangible results."
None of these pass the threshold required for slander

"Well, but it seems to me that the law applies to speech and debate *inside the halls of Congress.* It also appears to protect them from arrest on their way to our from those places and while inside. 

It isn't clear to me what is specifically meant by ""questioned,"" because certainly Congresspeople have been questioned in every forum about stuff they say in session. 

However, going by this it does appear you can sue them for slander over something said in public. Twitter posts somehow being ""official channels"" now, I'm not sure if that is protected or not. But if they go on the dumbass faux news shows and say shit that provably qualifies as slander, I say go for it.

"[Here's a discussion of the phrase shall not be questioned](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S6-C1-3-1/ALDE_00013300/).

The phrase is applied in the legal sense that they can't be called by a legal authority to defend themselves. In England at the time of our founding, members of Parliament could be punished for statements the King didn't like. They could be arrested on their way to Parliament to prevent them from voting against the King's interests, and so on. Art I, Sec. 6 is an attempt to prevent members of both houses from representing the interests of their constituents.

I note that 'shall not be questioned' is also used in Sec. 4 of the 14th Amendment."

While it also seems to leave statements to the media exposed to liability in at least some circumstances, I imagine it's a tough slog to actually win such a case. 

I wonder what the solution is. It really is in no one's best interest to have no definition or boundary at all between veracity and fabrication in the news and adjacent media. But it's far too far gone for a resurrected Fairness Doctrine, and that didn't really address actual lying anyway."

"Another real benefit of the public schools systems of the last century was a relatively common understanding of science and culture. We all learned the fundamentals of science, even as most people attend church every Sunday, we all learned of a common narrative of history, edited as it may have been, and we learned basic rules of civility. The right wants to edit our history further, and put more religion and less science in the curricula which will lead to further division of society."

"I believe Indiana already does that.  

I will explain but it's pretty involved.  Back in 2018 a catholic high school in Indianapolis fired a female guidance counselor who had worked there for 15 years because she was in a same-sex marriage.  Apparently it was common knowledge at that high school that she was in that same sex marriage.  The head of the Indiana Department of Education at the time was a democrat whose position at the time was voted on by the voters of Indiana.  She had a news conference saying she did not want to be considered to continue to be the Head of the Indiana Department of Education in 2020, because now the Head of the Department of Education was appointed by the governor, no longer voted on by the voters of Indiana and the administration was republican.  Someone asked her at this conference what she thought about the situation at that catholic high school.  She said she didn't think that any school that discriminated should receive tax money.  Indiana State Representative Bob Behning (Republican-Indianapolis) said that it wasn't the school that got the tax money, it was the parents and that if was an issue of religious freedom where the parents who received this money sent their kids.

I went to catholic schools for 12 years.  I left that piece of 💩 religion 49 years ago at the age of 20.  I don't know how my head didn't explode when I heard Bob Behning's comment. I'm so sick of these people trying to shove religion on society."

But in general I try not to WATCH the news period unless it's a major, major news event and stick to reading it and letting the AP and NPR notify me when something really big happens that I should be aware of. TV news no matter what the spin is so sensationalist because they need ratings.

But to the right, if it doesn't support their world view, whether its just straight up facts is left leaning."
Fuck no. Life's too short for that bullshit. Don't watch CNN or MSNBC either. NPR or PBS mainly. Newshour and Frontline should be required viewing
"I feel it is so hugely important to get your news from as many sources as reasonably possible.  Since I believe most news stations have become more opinion generators than news outlets (a direct result of the internet and social media), it seems the best way to fully understand an issue is to be able to see as many dissenting views as possible.  One thing that prevents is getting yourself stuck in an echo chamber.  Not to mention that I don't need someone trying to sell me on something I already believe in.

To me, it is more important to get someones viewpoint that I disagree with.  I believe it is important to be able to understand the opposing point of view, even if I disagree with it, if for no other reason that to be able to form an argument in my head on why I don't agree.  But it is also important to try to find common ground.  Do we both have the same end goal in mind?  Are our objectives the same, but just have different thoughts on how to achieve them?

Occasionally, I might find a compelling argument to change my mindset. At the very least it might get me to start looking into the validity of the argument that they are making.  If people are not willing to change their viewpoints in response to reasonable arguments, then we are in a lot of trouble."

> , but I wouldn't call CBS, ABC, and NBC intrinsically ""liberal"".

Like their audience, an the majority of the American people CBS, ABC, and NBC support minority rights, gay rights, reproductive rights, the notion that climate change is real, and that vaccines work, but on economic issues like wages, health care, and taxes, they are mum at least and to the right quite often, as they are corporate entities."
No. I don’t watch any 24 hour news channels. The format seems to corrupt the information. I listen to NPR and read AP with the rare WSJ off the news stand and various news podcasts.
I keep them in my news feeds but honestly the shit they babble about is so hateful and idiotic.
"Fox is more interesting for what they omit than what they report. As far as msnbc, it gets tiresome. Ari Melber and Chris Hayes are about the only two I can stand for very long. Rachel, if it's a big story. 

I don't care for intentionally whitewashed news so they can claim impartiality. I count myself smart enough to filter out opinion from fact. Joy Reed is almost unwatchable as she just seems like a gossip and not a reporter. It's kinda sad because I once rated her the most intelligent on msnbc. 

I do like Jake Tapper on cnn and stephanopolous on abc. Chuck on meet the press does a quality show but what I've grown most impatient with is what John Stewart complained about: putting a guest on and allowing them to evade or spin a question to irrelevancy. If you aren't going to follow up and hit them hard, don't bother."

I was about 10-12 and remember thinking, ""but liberals don't listen to this guy.""

Amidst the last 5 years of insanity and Faux ""News"" being constantly rammed down our throats I've thought about this a decent amount. I get enough of my fill of that bullshit as a byproduct through channels I actually want to subscribe to, no desire to give them my viewership statistic."

I find reading news much better for my mental state of mind
"Can't do it.  Blood pressure.

I kept winding up yelling at my television like a crazy person within 5 minutes of turning Fox News on.  So, I stopped turning it on.

I don't necessarily need an outlet to be liberal to watch it, but if it's not liberal, it's got to at least skew to the center, be an objective news outlet free of opinion, or have people from both the right and the left who are credible and get equal time arguing with each other.

I actually only have a psuedo-cable streaming service half of the year to watch football, but when I do have it, I take Fox News and similar channels off of my personal channel list, and block all the recommended shows from said networks.

The last time I remember watching Fox News was the night when President Obama caught Osama Bin Laden, and that was the first time I'd seen it in several years.

I just don't see a reason to subject myself to Fox News' crap and help their ratings.  There might be some value in people monitoring it for like public officials and candidates who appear on it and say newsworthy things, or to keep up with threats their hosts and guests pose to democracy, human rights, rule of law, concepts like objective truth and science, social programs, continued support for Ukraine, and so on and so forth, but that's not my job.  I'll let all the other people handle that for me and let me know if there's anything I should be aware of.

I can only really take hearing Trump talking at length if it's a debate where Joe Biden is yelling ""Worst President ever!"" in the background. :)"
"Worth mentioning:

NewsMax, presumably profiting from the advertising they show, used to offer it's feed to DirecTV for free.  Recently, they decided to charge DirecTV tens of millions of dollars on a regular basis for something they were getting for free up to a few weeks ago.

DirecTV made the business decision that not enough people watch that channel or subscribe to their service in order to watch that channel to pay NewsMax the new fee they were asking for.

This wasn't a political decision at all.  It was a business decision.  If NewsMax offered DirecTV their channel again for free tomorrow, presuming a contact of sufficient length so as not to have face demands for tens of millions of dollars all over again this time next year, DirecTV would probably air it.

Now, some satellite or streaming providers may air, just as Directv aired NewsMax when it was provided for free, similar free-to-the-cable/satellite/streaming-company stuff that may have minimal numbers of viewers and a minimal production value from the left wing as well as the right wing.  I think The Young Turks have a channel they offer around that is basically their left leaning radio show on television, and it's probably free to carry (I'm guessing.).

Channels like that often have low production values and even lower ratings, but they allow carriers to advertise that they have a much larger number of channels than they otherwise could advertise having, without spending a dime on some of said channels.

That's how you get all the odd religion channels that sometimes seem to be one long telethon trying to get people to send the preachers and their channels money, or that push a very politicized right-wing version of Christianity, or both.  Those channels approach the satellite company (Or whomever) and say ""Want a free channel that you can add to your channel count that will make the five people that call you every year saying they want to watch it very happy?"" and the satellite/cable/streaming company says ""Sure, why not?  We'll put it somewhere between channels 900-999 in our lineup."" (or wherever).

Some of the shopping networks get carried the same way.  In fact, it would not surprise me at all if some of the shopping networks actually paid the carriers to get placed in their channel lineup instead of usual situation with more popular channels, which is the other way around.

Conservatives who consider that censorship either don't understand the television business or are pretending not to understand the television business.

As the party of big business, you'd think that the Republicans would be all for market-driven decisons like this."

I want to salute the brave souls who watch it for their podcast/YouTube/blqwatever covfefe project where they report to us what’s animating the fascists these days. I would never do it “just because”
No. I have enough bullshit in my life.
"I used to watch so that I felt that informed and forewarned as to their positions, thinking, etc. but after a while I realised that it is dynamic yet with one underlying constant. They don’t care about whether what they believe or tell others is true or not. For them and their tribe, their is only one genuine sin, losing. Any activity or position that upgrades their position in their eyes from the perspective of winning is ok (which once I understood this explained all the hypocrisy and their apparent projection and obliviousness to it). Any activity that downgrades their position is a sin no matter how righteous e.g. Liz Chaney.

Once I had that realisation, I no longer needed to watch because it then became simply the same bullshit repurposed with a new look. Hence things like cancel culture etc. are simply constructs for the same purpose and not something that requires any thought."

"""22 liberal channels""? What is this congresscritter smoking, and may I have some?

The only ONE I can think of that skews liberal is Free Speech TV (available as a Roku app or from its website, and some satellite carriers). It carries Thom Hartmann's show, it carries 'Democracy Now!' with Amy Goodman (itself available as a standalone Roku app), among other programs.

Let me put it this way: Those of us who are left of center have stayed put for the most part on most core issues (social and economic) while those right of center have gone so far to the right (especially on social issues) they've run past the goalposts and out of the stadium altogether. The funny thing is they have the gall to deride even mainstream Democratic Party members ""communists,"" not just the much-more left congressional cohort exemplified by, say, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or Primila Jayapal.

When I was younger I used to hate-read the then-Daily Oklahoman when Eddie Gaylord was still alive and running it, because it was a gobsmackingly blindly conservative rag in those days. I also used to hate-read The Lawton Constitution when the Bentleys still ran it, especially when they'd give their by-then (early 1990s) retired editorial page editor, Ted Ralston, a guest column -- outrageously hateful, homophobic git that guy was (disclosure: I was living in Lawton in those days. Let's just say I will never return there).

At one time I used to subject myself to the online edition of the Washington Times until I just couldn't take it anymore. I sometimes read the Daily Mail (UK), which is just garbage that reads like a tawdry tabloid and has earned the nickname ""Daily Fail"" for a reason. 

I can't bring myself to watch Fox News, OAN, or Newsmax. The little time I spend watching television--an appliance, to me, that in my house is largely only reserved for sports and whatever I want to stream, is too valuable to me to waste it on shite like that. 

In the second place, people should limit their viewing of any cable news, yes even MSNBC, because all cable news is profit-driven and needs eyeballs, and that means putting on the air whatever might attract those eyeballs. The only host I'll still watch on MSNBC is Rachel Maddow--who's only on once a week now (I'm a lot more interested in her long-form projects, also I think people forget she's not a journalist by formal training, but an academic who ""fell into"" journalism, and I rather like that she approaches her show with an academic's attitude rather than a journo's).

One nitpick: PBS NewsHour is indeed long-running--50 years--but the longest-running US TV program in history is also a news program: NBC's 'Meet the Press.' Assuming Chuck Todd doesn't run it into the ground between now and November, it will have been on the air for 76 YEARS (debut: November 6, 1947)."

Some programs are more ""news-y"" albeit with an obvious preferred stance, like National Report, Spicer, and Greta, while others are straight-up propaganda, trolling, and scorn like Rob Schmitt and Gorka (ughhh), esp when they have hateful guests on like David Horowitz.

I saw DirecTV replaced Newsmax with something called The First, which is now home to Bill O'Reilly, so I'll need to check that out, though I hadn't heard of it.

Rs keep talking about how DirecTV is denying 13 million American households of Newsmax, as if 100% of the 13 million DirecTV households religiously watch Newsmax. In reality, barely 100,000 households watch Newsmax, across *all* cable providers and streaming platforms, which represents about 0.1% of the 125MM total TV households across the USA."

"It's also shown on military bases.

"I don't think being liberal has changed, only the specific cultural disagreements have.  Being a liberal, to me at least, means being open to the idea that other people have the same rights to happiness that we have.  This includes all people; immigrants, LGTBQ, prisoners, POC, and any other group we can think of.  All people.

That's what it means to me."
"OED definition of liberal = broad.

What does this mean you say? 

Broad, as in many ways of accomplishing something. Many solutions. Many strategies to solving problems. One way may work for this group, another way may be better for another group. 

Liberal political theory fits very well with freedom and free markets which consists of providers producing a variety of goods and services through 3 main avenues: 1) the private sector, 2) the public sector, and, 3) the households. All three must be robust and thriving. Each has an integral role to play in a healthy nation state. People then can maximize their ability to solve problems.

The private sector mainly focuses on routine production (making dog food, building cars over and over), the public sector mainly focuses on thorny, complex problems and problems that are not profitable for the private sector (poverty, discrimination, public health and safety, justice etc). Households focus on individual level issues like raising good citizens, who are healthy, law-abiding, engaged in their communities. 

Now compared this to the word conservative which means 1 solution, the old solution. The status quo. As such it has always had a strong tendency to lean toward the power of authoritarianism by default because human nature wants to be creative and free, and conservatives don't want that ergo conservatism is always seeking to curtail these urges and passions. It also pairs well with exclusion, narrowing opportunity, creating false scarcity, and limits."
I think the key difference is technology and the internet have shortened our attention span so much we can’t stay focused long enough to debate and with the anonymity of the internet we’ve just gotten meaner to each other.
"To me liberalism is the ideology of both positive and negative freedom, where society should be built around the idea self-determination and mutually beneficial social contracts. It advocates for the rule of law, due process, and equitable justice. It advocates market economy, balanced by consumer-friendly regulations, and supports a safety net so people can continue to participate in the economy.

There are different species of liberalism, social liberalism, ordoliberalism, social democracy, etc. each with their unique characteristics. 

Myself personally, I would consider myself a socially moderate, fiscally liberal person. I tend to believe social programs are best served at the most local level possible."

"Several questions I did not know enough about to have opinions on. But there was no ""I don't know ""option."
Good luck.
"A lot of these questions are set up for yes or no but there are not “good” blanket answers for them. Many of them “it depends” (like elective surgeries) and others could have a good “other” category with a blank (like should there be a new tax to fund Medicare/Medicaid) a good “other” could be limiting funding to certain Medicare parts. 
Like if a person has part A only (essentially just hospital) it’s really not a lot, and that person can only get access basically to emergency care only. Even outpatient follow up care may not be viable depending on the service. 
Good survey though. And good luck. I’m curious to see the overall responses."
Done
"you mean parts A,B, and D right?"
"Yup, part C is a cash grab by private insurers that never should have been allowed.."
"I would agree for the most part but, also say ""that depends"". If you can afford it and have a regular provider that is OON with Medicare getting a POS plan could be a good move? Or if you want to ensure that you have access to OON medicare services/providers for a future need?"
"Here's my theory: DeSantis is polarizing on his own. But this MF is playing the long game; he won't clap back at Trump by name so as to not polarize the MAGA vote; instead, he generalizes the attacks, and he's assuming Trump will die off alone. Trump needs to goad him into reacting directly, or Trump needs to form his own political party. They are not exclusive, so my ideal is Trump provokes DeSantis to directly clap back AND then Trump forms his own political party."
"I wonder if we will have to wait for actual book burnings to start before people pay attention. This is clearly not enough. Requiring student female athletes to provide information about their menstrual cycles to a non-HIPPA protected app isn't enough.

"That’s what everyone said about Trump. I mean, I agree. But I’m not really sure how to make it (not) happen. Fought tooth and nail against Trump. Perhaps motivating voters to come out for another candidate is the best option rather than being anti-whomever."

"Then the ""so called"" left media better start working a lot better on their message about the economy...

""Imagine that your picture of the U.S. economy came entirely from headlines and cable news chyrons. Would you know that real gross domestic product has risen 6.7 percent under President Biden, that America gained 4.5 million jobs in 2022 and that inflation over the past six months, which was indeed very high last winter, was less than 2 percent at an annual rate?  
  
This isn’t a hypothetical question. Most people don’t read long-form, data-driven essays on the economic outlook. Their sense of the economy is more likely to be shaped by snippets they read or hear.""

""What about media coverage? Some of my colleagues get upset about any suggestion that economic reporting has had a negativity bias that affects public perceptions. Yet there’s actually hard evidence to that effect. The Michigan Survey asks respondents about what news they’ve heard about specific business conditions; all through 2022 — as the economy added 4.5 million jobs — more people reported hearing negative than positive news about employment.""

"I work in a university and consider myself a liberal, but DeSantis is rightly worried about too many resources going to D&I in universities. It's gotten to a point where nearly every college has to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions, for administrators and programs that don't end up in the sciences and other worthy disciplines. D&I programs work their way into the hiring practices which turn each department into an affirmative action, quota-seeking body. They will literally post ""diversity hire"" in the job description which basically means, ""no white people."" It's racism in plain view. And that's just the tip of the iceberg."
"DeSantis doesn't give a damn about anything except culture wars and ""owning the libs"". His entire political ideology is about hate, and about convincing his supporters to hate whatever real or imagined threat the right-wing media has decided to focus on. But many people (such as LGBTQ) are harmed by his quest to kill ""wokeness"".

Instead of focusing on the economy, or the harm that inflation is doing to many working-class Americans, or the horrific police brutality against black Americans, or any of the problems that are afflicting people in this country, he decides to pull political stunts."

"I wonder if we liberals truly appreciate that man's capacity to do worse than Trump did. 

All Republicans want is someone with the potential to win. Trump has now dismantled our collective expectation of the president being a moral person. In a way, that is a good thing because nobody can live up to everyone's personal expectations. But he's lowered the floor so severely that Desantis, who wouldnt be given a second thought prior to 2016 is their idea of a viable leader. 

His antics in Florida are right out of a comic book for absurdity. But the part of the country that is anti liberal has no care for what standards they have in a leader except two: Win by any means necessary, and oppose every idea that doesnt serve the extremist right."
"he won't, at least i will do my part in elections that he won't  ...."
I'm out of the loop. Why is Ron DeSantis THAT bad? Don't know much about him.
We cant win forever. Sooner or later another Republican will make it to the White House and they are all as bad as De Santis or worse.

Given the choice between Joe Biden and Desantis I would certainly vote for the latter.
I live in Florida here and it is bad…DeSantis is a pure fascist by all aspects of the definition.  Floridians who believe in democracy whether you are historically democrat or republicans need help to stand up to this monster.

"It's worth noting ACB wrote the opinion, but it was a unanimous decision. It seems to be based on a strict reading of a federal statute that didn't leave much room for interpretation.

>She focused on the fact that federal law includes 16 explicit exceptions to the general rule that veterans can’t get retroactive compensation—and equitable tolling isn’t one of them. “The presence of this detailed, lengthy list,” Barrett wrote, “raises the inference that the enumerated exceptions are exclusive.” Put differently, it is “difficult to see” why Congress “spelled out a long list” if it did not want the list to be comprehensive.

Put simply, when Congress writes a list of explicit things into a law, anything that deviates from that specific list is not included by implication, unless provided otherwise.


Apparently Congress didn't write equitable tolling explicitly into the law, and the Court found that Congress intended it to be an exhaustive list. So now it is up to Congress to add it to the list through legislation."

What's going on in the world?

>*After an unusual delay, the Supreme Court finally issued its first opinion of the term on Monday: a unanimous decision in Arellano v. McDonough siding against disabled veterans who seek compensation for disabilities related to their service. Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s opinion for the court denied these veterans (and their survivors) the ability to obtain benefits retroactively if they filed a late claim - even if the delay occurred because of their disability or some other factor beyond their control.*

Who among us is more deserving than the men and women who served and made sacrifices for our country? And their families, who were right beside them all the way?

It's unfathomable to me. 

And the minority decided pick their battles for another day? 

>*It’s a painful blow to military members who were injured while serving their country, and a puzzling one: At oral arguments, the justices sounded divided, yet all three liberals lined up behind Barrett’s harsh opinion. Maybe they genuinely believed that Congress intended to impose an exceedingly stringent deadline on disabled veterans. Or perhaps the three-justice minority is so outnumbered that it has decided to pick its battles, and Arellano was not worth the fight.*

Arellano experienced trauma after his honorable discharge. He did not know he was eligible for compensation until years later.

>*Because of his incapacitation, Arellano did not understand that he qualified for disability compensation. His brother did not find out until 2011, at which point he filed a claim on Arellano’s behalf, asking for retroactive benefits for the previous 30 years. The Department of Veterans Affairs granted compensation moving forward but denied compensation for the past three decades. It said that federal law allows retroactive compensation only if service members file “within one year of discharge,” which Arellano had not.*

Congress did not want the law interpreted this way.

>*Shouldn’t the presence of so many exceptions indicate that Congress did not want rigid enforcement of the one-year deadline?*

Justice Barrets' interpretation left no wiggle room for the veterans and / or their families.

Leaving them to hang out and dry in the wind, as it were. Abandoned.

As if their sacrifice was their compensation.

WTH SCOTUS?

This was your first opinion? The first case you want the world to focus on?

Is this a further example of the horrors to come when it comes to other opinions waiting in the wings of America's hall of justice?

>*Barrett, a former civil procedure professor, ignored the principle of solicitude toward veterans in favor of a wooden analysis of the “statutory scheme.” She focused on the fact that federal law includes 16 explicit exceptions to the general rule that veterans can’t get retroactive compensation—and equitable tolling isn’t one of them. “The presence of this detailed, lengthy list,” Barrett wrote, “raises the inference that the enumerated exceptions are exclusive.” Put differently, it is “difficult to see” why Congress “spelled out a long list” if it did not want the list to be comprehensive.*

Where is the justice for the veterans and their families?

The __freight train of one term twice impeached disgraced former President Trump’s treachery and logorrhea__ still lingers, even after his failed __insurrection and miserably conniving__ attempts at *maintaining a stronghold* on the Department of Justice, political landscape, RNC, SCOTUS and the USA.

IMO?

Congress needs to do more to protect our Veterans and their families.

And make sure they get the benefits and support they deserve.

ASAP.

But I thought they’re all about Christian values
"If I was the lawyers in this case, I would have fought tooth and nail to get that vet an earlier effective date, and I would have pushed it just as far as these litigants did...

But this was a hail Mary. So basically, the law in question here (38 USC 5110(b)(4)) says you are entitled to an effective date equal to your date of discharge *if you were permanently and totally disabled at discharge*, and unable to apply for benefits.

Perm-total is a specific designation that applies to many *but not all* disabled vets who are 100% disabled. So you can have a disability rating of 100%, but not be considered ""permanently and totally disabled"" by the VA (which only really matters in a few very important instances, like this).

SO, the vets advocates in this case were trying to get the court to apply a fairness doctrine called equitable tolling, and expand 5110(b)(4) to cover vets who *are not perm-total* which would include me, and millions of other vets who could now flood the VA with applications for an earlier effective date.

Is it a loss for vets? Technically yes. Is it a huge kick in the pants for vets advocates trying to expand their benefits? Not really."

Shitbags
It seems the three liberal judges sided with ACB on this ruling.
"Yeah, the ruling seems to make perfect sense to me. The article seems to be implying that the Supreme Court should ignore the text of the legislation and should just insert additional conditions into the law where it's not written.

It's asking SCOTUS to legislate from the bench, which is not at all what it's supposed to do."

A belief that society CAN and SHOULD get better on a series of metrics related to individual human lives (in other words we can incrementally increase the QUANTITY and QUALITY of life people experience in terms of making peoples lives generally longer and happier over time) and that good governance has a role to play in achieving this. 

2. As commitment to the principle that individuals and organized groups of individuals are often the best source of information about themselves and that their voices must be heard in the quest to achieve number 1. In other words… a belief in listening and responding to peoples’ needs (especially those from vulnerable communities).

3. An opposition to the undue amassing of power by any individual, group, or organization over other groups. In practice this means limiting governmental, institutional, or corporate incursion of human and civil rights and also ensuring that individuals are not able to exercise that sort of power over others at the ground level. In other words… advancing equality and limiting abuse.

4. A belief that DEMOCRACY (though imperfect) is the only moral system of government and that it’s institutions must be protected against damage, corruption, or negation to maintain the legitimacy of the government.

5. A belief that market economics (though imperfect) is the only system of political economy that most closely aligns with the democratic principles from principles 2 and 4 and the advancement of quality and quantity of life sought in principles 1 and 2 and that it’s negative externalities CAN and SHOULD be addressed with good policy to ensure it also promotes human rights.

6. A belief that PERSUASION is a necessary component of democracy and market economics and that to abandon that idea means abandoning the very idea of democracy.

- It's the disabled person's battle against the notion that they're worthless because they can't produce money. 
- It is the Black person's battle against White superiority. 
- It is the woman's battle against the patriarchy and the notion that they are property, like the property of their father or their husband, or that they are baby machines, that their personal aspirations like their educational and career aspirations don't matter or are secondary. 
- It is the man's battle against the notion that his value lies in his ability to make money, how much power he has, and his ability to have sex with women. 
- It is the poor person's battle against the notion that he is less than or inferior to a rich person and is thus worthy of less and worthy of poorer treatment by society, police, etc.

And are they right? No.

redditors when they learn everything isn't black and white: 😡
The Bible may not tell people to not think but the religion of Christianity definitely does
"I'm sorry, but many of the fundamentalists I've known actively tell their people that relying on their own thought as opposed to what's taught in the bible is blasphemous.  And they don't talk about their beliefs being well thought out; they believe that whatever god ""said"" via the bible must be true regardless of whether it makes any sense, and even if it's contradictory.  Fundamentalist Christians, or the ones I've been exposed to (and I was born and raised in the Bible belt) do not respect scholars, only those who supposedly have received inspiration directly from god.  

I wasn't raised fundamentalist, and tho was Christian I was in fact taught to think for myself.  But these groups are absolutely not taught that.  I know they're in a minority among Christians, but the minority is growing.  And their ministers and pastors are more and more insistent that only what's written in the bible can be regarded as true and every word in the bible must be regarded as *literally* true.  

I do know that people who've never been directly exposed to these groups have trouble comprehending that people could believe this.  But it's real, and it's very scary."

"I can't speak for fundamentalists as I am a Catholic. I am mostly talking about more traditional protestant groups (High Church Anglicans and Lutherans for example), Catholics, Orthodoxy, and Islam. Small protestant denominations all have different beliefs, so it's hard to articulate their exact teachings."
"What does my religion have anything to do with this? I am a liberal myself (specifically Christian Democrat), I just think you made a shtty point."
"I was raised Catholic and I also was taught to think for myself (I'm so thankful for those nuns -- they were great).  And I agree with you about mainstream Protestant groups.  But these days they are not nearly as much in the majority as you may think.  In ten years, I suspect they won't be in the majority at all.  It's why people like me look at *The Handmaid's Tale* as predictive rather than fictional.  That said, I applaud your idealism; it's a great thing to see in young people (and I'm assuming you are younger than I, since I'm elderly)."
Just seemed to make a bad impression is all
"Because I disagreed with what you said and I was Catholic, so you immediately disregarded what my reply? Reddit is such an echo chamber. I bet you unironically use r/politics"

But that’s an American thing!
I hope you're right. Gen Z is growing but stupidity is endless.
"Gen Z here. We’ll make you proud, I promise."
"It's interesting noting the importance of Generation Z in the 2022 election results, yet the Right has, since then, basically doubled down on their inflammatory rhetoric and policies towards non-whites, non-gender-conforming, anti-abortion, etc. Meanwhile, apparently assured by the fact that the younger generations have always vote disproportionately less than older generations, dismissing 2022 as an anomaly rather than a part of a trend. Also the whole George Santos thing.

It makes you wonder where that brazen confidence and lack of introspection comes from, and then the heinous rates at which dark money continues to pore into their coffers makes it all make sense. They don't really care that their downfall is inevitable, they just intend to milk their last remaining vestiges of power for as much money as they can before it happens."
Thank the Supreme Court for killing RvW.. sometimes when you win you really lose.
It's not an age thing. It's a stupidity thing. I'm 64 and I say HOORAY! I grew up with a mixture of races in school. People who didn't are still afraid and will believe any horseshit to try to stave off losing master-race status. To them it's a covert race/orientation (us vs them) war.
I'll be happy only once the dinosaurs are all swept away.
"Confirmation bias is especially strong in right wingers. So many of them saw Trump's 2016 election win as proof that the far right are the majority in America, despite the fact that he didn't even win the popular vote. An awful lot of them are still riding that wave of certainty despite all the bruisings they've taken since then.

They continue to double down and go more hardcore on the extremism, enormously overestimating the number of people this appeals to, while continuously alienating more and more young voters every day."

"Being a gay man I'm surprised he was able to get this far in the Republican party. I'm sure most of the other people in the party and him for being gay. But they have to pretend to be cool with them. If he's forced out, or resigns. You most likely get replaced by a Democrat."

Yeah, R's would never vote for an openly gay man, but that's not what they heard. The ads on Fox News were all about ""George Santos"" the devout christian Wall Street banking mogul, meanwhile MSNBC is playing ads about ""George Santos"" the openly gay Jewish holocaust survivor without a penny to his name, and nobody who watches either channel has any clue that the other contradictory ads exist."
That's easy they are all hypocrites.

"I’ve long fantasized about asking my conservative Trump loving Christian parents about the “grab em by the pussy” comment, and using that phrase over and over again until they ask me to stop. Then pointing out that he said it and that’s who they voted for. I will prob never do it because as much as they still love Trump I think they are ready for someone else to replace him. But if he does indeed run again we will prob have fo have that conversation. 

To answer your question, hit them with the deplorable thjngs he said on camera that you can easily pull up on YouTube. And if they try to excuse it as locker room talk, or tough businessman behavior, tell them you want a better person than that as President and they obviously don’t. Make them own it"
"All you can do is hit them with undeniable facts...  
\-Donald Trump has never won the popular vote in any election EVER. Trump lost the majority in BOTH presidential runs and only had plurality wins in the GOP primaries...You may need to explain what a plurality is.  
\-The national debt increased by $8.6T over Trump's four fiscal years. That would be $300 billion more than Obama added in 8 fiscal years. They won't want to believe that either as their propaganda has grooved them into thinking that Obama added $10T. He didn't.  
\-Trump's early onset bungling has killed more Americans than otherwise sound disaster management would have permitted. Our nation's body count could be as low as 436,000 if we had matched Canada's 1,300 deaths per million or 843,000 if we could have tied Mexico's 2,524 per millions. Instead, we set a record of 3,700 per millions and the highest number of verified COVID deaths of all the nations of 1.13 million.

Block their accounts. You can't fix stupid
Don’t even try to engage these people.  They have their own version of the facts and can’t even quote their own sources.  Waste of time and air.
People still support Trump?  Talk about living in the past
"Sadly the only tactic that (used to) work on crazies was to metaphorically isolate them from their community i.e. virtually everyone around them would just ignore their presence until they eventually came around.

But in the age of the internet, isolation is basically impossible.  That's why these troglodytes are so persistent."
"Understanding some of their tactics is a good first step to understanding how to, or not to, talk to them.

"It’s simple- I avoid and do not interact with them. It’s hopeless and endlessly frustrating, so I just can’t anymore. As far as I’m concerned that live in a perpetual state of self-induced ignorance. My mental health is more important than trying to change their minds."
"Mock them. They won't listen to facts, take advantage of that to show they are idiots."

"You cannot.

The fact that you think you can reach them or truly get them to change reflects the fact that you’re new here. Can’t stop ignorance by being flippant. Can’t do it by being civil. Gotta wait it out and hope young people vote. That’s literally all you can do short of taking a gun to somebody.
"The loserheimer feeds off attention and publicity, so I try to ignore him and change the station. Same might apply to his supporters. You're not gonna make them see the light 'cause they just don't want to see it. Ignore them."
"In person, I don't bother, but online I have a bunch of prepared statements/facts/links for rebuttal in a text file. They're pretty generally open to any political statements these types of people make. Generally, don't waste your time uniquely replying to each one, just use a general statement (facts and citations are great) that might get their heads turning. Or probably not, but seeing them rage is pretty fun. 1 out of like 100 will have something decent to say in a discussion, but even that usually trails off into nothing after a few replies."
Don't give Trump's name so much power. He's not freaking Voldemort.
"Like most others, I think it’s pointless to communicate at all with MAGAts. Our average lifespan is only seventy some years, so I have no time to spare on willful ignorance.

If you chose to engage I know of one thing that may help—at least in print/texts.

The wonderful writer Joyce Carol Oats treated his name as the obscenity that it should be, and expressed it as print media would have done in the past. So, instead of his full name she would replace it with: Tr*mp. Obviously it’s up to you which letter to replace and capitalization is optional."
"I recommend u simply stop talking to them, it sounds like u might find a thrill out of your hate for them and I understand not liking trump, he’s an awful person but obviously this hatred has led you to seek out his supporters online and “obliterate their arguments” at the end of the day that mindset holds no constructive value, if your intent on talking to them isn’t to educate them, it isn’t to persuade them but rather to humiliate and embarrass them then your just chasing an argument to argue. I would suggest for your own well being to just isolate yourself from these political arguments all together, spend this time doing something for yourself, something constructive, maybe take a walk, find a nice view within walking distance to you and enjoy it, maybe you can find a constructive hobby like cooking, or learning a skill, at the end of the day your time would be better spent doing something constructive then chasing political arguments so that you can “obliterate” the other debater."
"People are really, really good at rationalizing and you are dealing with people who for the most part are part of a cult. You can not pull them out with logic. You have to treat them as you would any cult member.

A bit from this

Ask thought-provoking questions while being warm and curious. Be prepared to listen deeply. You will know if you have listened well if you can repeat back to them what they said. Be humble and open to hearing what they say.

  
Keep conversations positive, productive, and civil. Never get angry. Stay resourceful. It is better to end the interaction than to say something counter-productive. It is better to return to the conversation at another time, rather than the person cutting off all communication out of anger or fear.

  
Adopt a general tone of curiosity and interest in their positions. Pretend you’re an impartial counselor. Really try to get inside their beliefs.

  
Try to connect them with their authentic identity before these extreme beliefs. Remind them of past experiences together. Talk about the connection you once had and how you miss it.  


Don’t “tell” them anything. Help them to make discoveries on their own.

  
Try to get them to look at reality from many different perspectives. This can include many things.

  
Teach them about indoctrination and mind control. Use examples for which they have no attachment.

  
Use examples of cult leaders with similar qualities to their group's leader(s) and have conversations about it.

  
Share feelings and perceptions, not judgments. Use “I feel” statements. Don’t claim to be “right.” Stick to what your perception is when reflecting back to them.

  
Ask a question and then wait for them to think and respond. Be patient. You do not need to fill silence.

  
Caution: an abundance of facts won't necessarily help. Do not overwhelm them with information, especially if it attacks the leader or doctrine."
"The thing you need to understand about trump supporters and ring wingers in general is, they don’t actually believe any of their nonsense. They don’t believe in anything really. Their entire philosophy is: they are right, you are wrong. The rest is just irrelevant details. They’re right, therefore, they must be in power, since you are wrong you shouldn’t have any say In anything."
Just show them an example of Trump saying something racist and then ask them their thoughts
My best friend is one but we listen to music and drink scotch. There are more important things than politics.
"Why get yourself all lathered up debating people w completely different views that will never change.  What a complete burn of time. Imo, go enjoy the day.  It's okay to not be obsessed w politics 24/7.  It's actually healthy."

"It’s a valid question. Show them the videos of Trump saying these things. Why should they take your word for it exactly? I would hope you would know that you just telling them things is NOT proof of something. You mad a claim, back it up instead of getting upset. Since he said all these horrible things, it should be very easy to produce no?

You guys really need to stop thinking about this man and just let it go."
“conservative biased news stations” why would conservatives listen to liberal biased news stations. do you listen to conservative biased news stations?
Youre literally just feeding the trolls. Foaming at the mouth in opposition to these people is not going to accomplish anything. Most of these people are above the age of 50 and will be dead soon anyway. Let them die out and hold your ground in the meantime. They will not change their minds.
The best part about President Trump is that he is in your head.  He is the best president since Reagan.   Y’all can’t stand the fact that he really did a great job while in office.  The democrats are the most corrupt party ever.

If it was such a coup attempt then what was the master plan? Who was involved in this plan? How was trump involved in this plan? How was he actually attempting to take over the country using protestors? Do you have even 1 fact or evidence proving trump wanted anything more than protesting and guilty of something in regards to Jan 6?

"What happened on Jan 6 was [only one part](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/09/five-ways-donald-trump-tried-coup/620157/) of the attempts to overturn the election results and stay president. Trump made various attempts to stop the legal exchange of power. ([If it's paywalled](https://web.archive.org/web/20230109162620/https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/09/five-ways-donald-trump-tried-coup/620157/)).

""At the rally prior to the vote count in Congress, Trump urged the crowd to act, saying, “*If you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.*” The explicit goal of the rally and subsequent riot was to pressure Congress, and Pence in particular, into overturning the election results. Trump told his followers, “*If Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election.”*""

Trump spent months lying that the election was stolen and riling up his followers, then told them to fight for their country. One offhanded comment to do it peacefully is pretty meaningless when he'd stoked that much outrage and encouraged them to interrupt the certification process."
This one's better
"My guess is a lot of people you’re talking to won’t see anything wrong with most of those comments, in which case like most people have suggested it’s better to just disengage lol"
There’s so little anybody can do. I phone banked for giving felons the right to vote in Florida and it passed but Desantis found a way to take all the teeth out of that. I used to write might congress people but they alway ‘respectfully disagreed.’ Now I’m trying to enjoy life and the people going around the sun with me.
">Trump made various attempts to stop the legal exchange of power.  
 
 and none of them illegal and none of them involved a coup. What your link talks about (and i agree this was the plan) was not illegal. It was exactly working WITHIN the laws as currently stated which is why Pelosi recently changes the laws to make this plan harder to implement in the future. That's the opposite of a coup. That's working in the legal framework to affect change - LEGALLY.     
  
You said coup but you fail to show any evidence of an actual coup.  
  
>The explicit goal of the rally and subsequent riot was to pressure Congress, and Pence in particular, into overturning the election results.  
 
 Again nothing illegal. Protesting is not illegal or a coup. Your link make my point for me so thanks for that.   
  
>then told them to fight for their country.   
  
Which is common political rhetoric and clearly standard practice... unless you also believe EVERY democrat also illegal: https://youtu.be/XG5BcU1ZGiA    
  
>Trump spent months lying that the election was stolen  
  
You dont know Trump was lying. You dont know that he may legitimately believe this. Can you read his mind? or anyones? I cant.   
  
So again, you said coup. Do you have literally ANY facts to support your statement because you havent provided any yet."
"Yeah I mean your approach is probably just as valid as mine. If not more. Me, I just slash and burn. At least if you maintain a friendship and have contact there’s some chance of your viewpoint getting through to your friend- even if you don’t spend all your music/scotch time blathering on about politics. But I don’t know…the propaganda and mind control is strong with that group"
">The reactionary appeal is one that liberals underestimate at our peril. For many years, we had a bad habit of assuming Fukuyama’s “end of history” — that there is some kind of unidirectional inevitability to the expansion of freedom and tolerance. This ignores the complicated ebbs and flows of real history and how hard-won rights and freedoms can be stripped away far more quickly than we’d expect. The events of the past decade have mostly snapped people out of this misconception, but the fact that it took hold for so long should warn us about the allure of complacency.

Nailed it!"
"As a Liberal, you must convince to be Sloth,"
I've been thinking about Fukuyama a lot lately. He works great for State Dept speeches in the 90's but we really need to stop treating his work like it was that visionary. He was wrong. Super wrong.
"I almost don’t want to know. I rather modestly ask business owners not to shove their odious politics in my face when I’m about to patronize them. I’ve certainly had my last sandwich from Jimmy John’s, to name an example."
No way am I giving them any of my information to log in.
Be warned they collect the maximum amount of phone data possible.
I am glad these chuckleheads have gotten more open and  proud of their backwards ways. Intelligence is not their strong point. They are more easily avoided when foaming at the mouth over things they can't handle in life and mostly I don't need an app to recognize them.
"I really don't like the idea of sorting into red restaurants or blue restaurants, which is what this app will do.

I don't want to live in an echo chamber everywhere I go. I want blue people to come to red restaurants and red people to come to blue restaurants. We have to continue to engage with people we disagree with and look for ways to get along instead of sorting ourselves into homogeneous groups."
No ethical consumption and all... that does seem interesting to check out
I just looked at the app briefly.  😳  Kinda scary.
Is In n Out and Raising Cane’s on there? Huge Republican donors.
"I just looked through the app, and I’m happy to say there is not even one business listed near me or that I’ve heard of here in Columbus, Ohio."
"Union busting, they became infamous for making low-level food service workers sign non-compete contracts (which for workers like that are unenforceable nearly everywhere, but most food service workers would have no reason to know that) and their founder was infamous for big game hunting in Africa. He does not need any more of my money."
What is it about Jimmy John's that you find so odious? Is it their union busting? I wasn't aware of any far right radical political leanings like Goya or Yuengling.
But having the app definitely helps to support the “right” people.
"Yuengling as in the beer? That's disappointing, it's the only ""cheap beer"" that I like and I always grab one when I'm back east."
"Yeah, their founder was always very pro-Trump. Some bars I frequented in Williamsburg stopped serving it because of that."

Our justice system sucks.
But that would entail actual work.
They need to act & stop discussing.
"Why don’t they all do their jobs instead of charging politicians with things that won’t stick? We all know they’re all above the law. Just make eggs and gas affordable, please."
Right? Lots of discussion.
"Anyone contemplating prosecuting Trump has to know that he will extract as much monetary and political capital as he can. His lawyers will prosecute, his PR people will smear, and his cult will threaten, anyone who crosses his path. It has had its intended effect. Most of his offenses have been deflected. I hope some day he really has to atone, because when something finally breaks through his defenses, it’ll be a doozy. Unfortunately my money is on a heart attack."

Memphis police are historically corrupt. I hope the entire city comes out and forces change to this abomination of a police department.
A big chunk of my family too. It’s sad watching them posting far-right talking points on the regular. (That I come at them from a labor movement perspective doesn’t seem to help much.) But even they haven’t gone near this one yet that I know of.

I don't think this was about neutralizing a threat. It was about making people suffer. Police keep doing this, over and over and over. It's time to question their role in our country."

Apparently the school got reports about the kid having a gun and failed to take it seriously. Somebody was negligent and deserves to be fired.
The kid should have been removed from school after threatening to set the teacher on fire. The parents should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law for their negligence.
"They reported the child with a gun three times to school administrators and was ignored all three instances.

Someone needed to be fired."
"It sounds like there are a lot of systemic issues in the district. From NPR

> MURPHY: In the weeks since the shooting, teachers in Newport News have said they don't feel safe at school or backed up by their administrators. At a recent school board meeting, current and former staff spoke for hours. They say administrators are not addressing discipline issues and violence, in part over concerns about accreditation. Here's Newport News teacher Nicole Cooke.  COOKE: Teachers, students and other staff members are being hurt. Every day, they're hit. They're bitten. They're beaten. And they're allowed to stay so that our numbers look good."
Lucky this teacher survived
"From r/Teachers:  

>[I keep seeing headlines about “mounting criticism towards the Virginia school district” for the 6-year-old shooting Mrs. Zwerner. The truth is…](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/10lscfq/i_keep_seeing_headlines_about_mounting_criticism/)   
  
This could have happened at any one of our school districts and we know it. The “blind eyes” and “sweeping concerns under the rug” and admin ignoring complaints is EVERYWHERE. That 6-year-old just happened to do this in that location. This is not a Virginia problem, a Richneck Elementary problem or a Newport News problem. THIS IS AN EVERYWHERE PROBLEM.   
Why does it take a bullet in a body for incompetent leaders to step down? Reading the timeline of that day makes me so fucking furious. I hope she bankrupts the district."
"The teacher had been asking for help with the kid for months, he threw chairs across the room and told the teacher he wanted to light her on fire and watch her burn. The school had been warned about the gun too and searched the kid's bag but not the kid."
The police should have been called and stayed to the gun was found
"The Superintendent is the CEO of a school district. If at a branch location a customer brings a gun into the store, threatens an employee three times, and three times the branch manager denies the employees request for backup because of policies put in place by upper management, the CEO will take the blame.

In this case the superintendent is taking the heat and is leaving and taking blame. That's a huge part of their job. Superintendents move around all the time and while they provide leadership to a district, they're also there to leave when needed to save the district facce. 

What needs to happen is the school admins get fired. If this happened at Target and the manager told the cashiers to ignore the crazy five-year-old with a gun, the managers would be fired instantly."
Sounds like there were systemic or previous issues going on and this was the tipping point.  Three teachers reporting a student with a wish to harm a teacher and a gun should have set off all kinds of alarms.
"Well, we’ve tried nothing and we’re all out of ideas"
This country is pretty much lost.
Seems like he is getting blamed for failures of the underlings. Lots of reports about this kid that didn’t get taken seriously. But eventually the boss gets fired when catastrophic safety failures happen.
Is the Superintendent part of the union?
"The administration was notified four separate times of the allegations the child brought a gun to school. They searched his bag but not his coat or person. 

The last of four, the administration apparently directed the teachers to “wait it out” because the end of the day was close. The child showed the gun to a classmate at recess and made them cry when saying if they told, the child would shoot them too. 

This is a bad take. The gun issue is of course a critical one, and the root of this problem. But firing people for gross negligence resulting in a person being shot is of no purse appropriate."
"Well we have to blame someone. And the teacher was the victim so it cant be him/her. We certainly cant blame the parents, parents are never at fault. We cant blame the principal because he wouldn't get the nice severance package the superintendent did and how would he survive? Yea the super will be fine."
In some organizations shit rolls uphill
"“Fired him”

They are giving him a half million dollars."
A few years ago after another shooting there was debate on whether to install metal detectors in Hampton and NN schools. The superintendent voted against it. So that’s why they fired him.
"Is this an argument for teachers to carry guns, so they can return fire when kids shoot at them? /sarcasm"
"Damn straight. They had multiple reports that day alone, including a couple that he had a gun with / on him, and just ignored it, NBD (his *pockets* are *too small*), hoping he'd just go home with it and become someone else's problem. Plus you have a kid who is apparently so far off the rails, the requirement was that he needs a parent to accompany him in school, and then that's somehow the week they don't, so why is he even in the classroom?

That's definitely not on the teachers, it's not like they're given a choice about who's in their classroom. It's unclear how much blame rests on the principal, but that's what the investigation is for, they can still fire plenty more people if it's warranted, but they can safely start at the top for now."
"I think the reports (on the day of, at least) were to the school admin (ie the Principal and Vice Principals).

I was a public school teacher for five years, and I wish I could say that their inaction was surprising to me, but it's not.

Most of the school administrators I worked with were made of hot garbage."
"Someone was negligent, so fire the superintendent without the due diligence needed to determine who was actually negligent. More controversially, it may have been long-standing policies that these people *properly* abided by that allowed this tragedy to unfold as it did. Policies can be the offending party, but we always must have human blood."
The superintendent isn't even at the school making day-to-day decisions. Maybe the principal or whatever administrator decided to ignore the repeated warnings?
"that's on the local school, not necessarily the superintendent...right?"
As near as I can tell all the reporting happened during the day of the shooting by teachers and students to the administration. That would not percolate up to the Supe in any districts I am aware of. I don’t know how they came to the conclusion the Supe was to blame so rapidly
OK the administration here in this story is the principal and the vice-principal. These things don't filter up to the Supe beforehand.
When are the parents gonna be held accountable for not properly securing their gun?
Mistakes were made...
"Where do you think policies come from? Do bad policies write and enforce themselves? If you’re in charge and one of your policies results in this completely preventable tragedy, you get fired."
The whole stack should be fired.
"Why shouldn't they be fired? Ultimately, it was their organizational failure that led to this. *Every* administrator who failed to act should be fired, including the supe."
"[This gun was supposedly in a closet, on a 6' shelf in the legally required locked box](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/01/19/richneck-elementary-shooting-family-statement/). 

If an adult can open a box so can a kid. How many adults take their child proof medicine bottles to kids to open?"
"They very likely come from legislators, in some cases decades ago. I'm not saying this applies in this specific incidence - I'm speaking to the broader issue of people always seeking to find blame in others even if the target is clearly not the appropriate target. It's a sociological phenomenon that takes on a variety of forms depending on context. How much of that is manifesting here remains to be seen.

(Edit: Specifically to schools; they are *all* taking school shootings seriously. Teachers put their lives in danger - in a way that ought be unimaginable - simply walking into school just like the kids do. They have every reason to be *even more terrified* than most adults. 

These shootings are now a weekly experience for schools, hitting all types of educational institutions regardless of geographic location, local politics, income inequality, wealthy v poverty, etc. 

The problem is clearly systemic. But no one wants to deal with that, it's too abstract. They want heads on a pike."
"If it is a ""culture"" of complaceny the culture needs to be rooted out. It is like a joist in your house with termites...everything rotten has to go, new structure put in place. This cannot happen again. Period. 

Unlike assault weapons in America...that is protected craziness"
That the kid got the gun is proof that it was improperly secured. Hold the parents responsible.
I'm not saying the parents shouldnt be responsible but kids are not fucking stupid. If you can open the case with a key so can they. Stealing the keys/money/cigarettes  from moms purse is a time honored tradition. They can get chairs to get cookies and candy off the top of the fridge and a gun as well. There is nothing you can do to stop a kid from getting to it if you can access it. All you can do is make it take longer and not worth the effort unless they are determined.
That the kid got the gun is proof that it was improperly secured.
"If you know your kid has severe psychological problems and is threatening violence, and if you cannot keep your gun out of their hands, then get rid of the frigging gun!!!"
"No it isnt. That isnt how the LAW works. The law specifies what properly secured it, not whether a child can figure out how to bypass the measures."
"I don't disagree. But then I don't carry or have a hand gun anyway since I think most reasons people have them are not good reasons. But for those individuals who work in certain jobs, live in certain neighborhoods and feel they need the gun just getting rid of it may not be an option. Should a police officer who has such a child not have his service weapon anymore?"
"You are correct. The ""LAW"" sucks, and a significant part of the responsibility for that falls square on the shoulders of gun nuts who resist all regulation. Here's the applicable law in Virginia:

§ 18.2-56.2. Allowing access to firearms by children; penalty.
A. It shall be unlawful for any person to recklessly leave a loaded, unsecured firearm in such a manner as to endanger the life or limb of any child under the age of fourteen. Any person violating the provisions of this subsection shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.

B. It shall be unlawful for any person knowingly to authorize a child under the age of twelve to use a firearm except when the child is under the supervision of an adult. Any person violating this subsection shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. For purposes of this subsection, ""adult"" shall mean a parent, guardian, person standing in loco parentis to the child or a person twenty-one years or over who has the permission of the parent, guardian, or person standing in loco parentis to supervise the child in the use of a firearm.

....so if a kid gets hold of a gun without the parent's ""knowledge"", they are 100% off the hook. Irresponsible gun owners have little chance of being held responsible for misuse of guns, and I suppose that's the way most gun owners would have it, regardless of the usual blaming of deaths on irresponsible gun owners. I would wager most gun owners are in fact irresponsible, if not in securing their own guns, but in supporting reasonable gun laws that can actually hold gun owners responsible for the mayhem inflicted by their Constitutionally protected toys."
Not at his home if he can't keep it out of the child's hands.
"An if we change the law responsible gun owners will be going to prison despite their best efforts. If you put parents in prison for doing the right thing, the kid bypasses and still gets a gun there is no incentive to do the right thing and the parents will stop even trying. Our legal system is about punishing the actual guilty not the people who tried to do what they were supposed to and got screwed."
So you're saying no-one should own guns because no-one can keep them out of the hands of little children?
"I'm saying that locks and boxes aren't any better to keep guns from children than they are to keep thieves from your house and car. Determined individuals will bypass them.  

Education and making the children understand that they are not allowed to touch the gun is a better long term solution that relying on technical devices."

So I am guessing George Santos wont be visiting GA anytime soon. Or any other republican state for that matter.
"It's important to note that a lot of these bills are just performative virtue signalling. Of those bills which are introduced something like [90% of them fail to pass](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2022/10/14/anti-trans-bills/) in the state legislatures.

Given the low success rates I suspect a lot of it is just hollow attempts at fundraising - cashing in on the latest culture war trend."
"I don’t care about what bathrooms are used, or what medical treatment they receive, people are people. What does concern me is the sports issue. I know we’re all just trying to be inclusive and supportive but the reality is there is a physical advantage for men in sports which has to be addressed delicately when discussing this particular issue. There is a reason we separate men and woman’s categories. It’s a difficult position to take, I know, but it has to be said."
They're all excited to be the next Hitler
"For the hateful bunch in office, Trans is the easiest target. They have the least amount of support and money in government, very little advocacy compared to other rights groups, and make enough people uncomfortable to make it hard to get behind them. 

This is class A bullying in it's worst form. These poor people can't catch a break and the American Taliban have no problems or resistance beating up on them."
He looks like cheap Nixon
Did what?
10% passing is far too many.
"This. Tennessee continues to introduce bills every year with no real intention of passing them. They're just to confirm to the electorate that they sent the ""right man"" to the capital for them. Bills like forcing businesses with M/F restrooms to place warning signs, making the bible the State Book, forcing In God We Trust into public places, making it illegal to be gay, making it a felony to hold drag shows...on and on. Even for those that make it through, they're halted immediately by suit, and then thrown out by a judge. But that's not the point. Once again, the hillbillies sent the ""right man"" to the capital to waste everyone else's time and money."
"I think most people feel the same way.  I think people transitioning and becoming the gender they want to be is fantastic, but in competitive sports at any level, people born male will have an advantage over people born female.  Unless the transition began before puberty, which is obviously a whole other controversial topic.

My favorite sport is disc golf.  There was a pretty recent controversy involving this.  It ended up leading to the sport's governing body, the PDGA, making a rule that male to female transgender players cannot compete in the Female professional division in the sport's ""biggest"" tournaments unless they began to transition before puberty.

They can still compete in the Female division in lower tier tournaments if transitioning after puberty, but they have to prove that their testosterone levels are below a certain threshold, and that they have been taking the gender affirming hormone therapy for at least 24 months prior to playing.

To me, this is completely fair.  It allows MtF transgender athletes to compete as females in A-tier events and below.  A-tiers are not ""major"" tournaments, but you need to be an extremely talented disc golfer to be competitive in one at the open/pro level.  Winning an A-tier tournament is still a prestigious thing.  Also, a man can't just say ""I'm transitioning,"" begin HRT, and start competing as a female right away.

For reference, the vast majority of men that are competitive disc golfers would not be able to win an A-tier event competing only against women, or even get close."
But also it's unacceptable to be so precious about sports that it prevents people from living their best life.
"Ok sure, but you realize the importance of this issue is relatively minor compared almost anything. It's a game.  A small percent of people will benefit by getting scholarships, etc and an even smaller subset will become pros at is.  The number of Trans athletes are TINY. If people support all this transphobic bullshit for this one issue, they aren't good people."
A slight breeze.

"It’s important to recognize that conservatives are living the lives they want, the system has been set-up in their favor, and that’s changing. I’m not making excuses, but understanding that their lifestyle is being threatened does explain their behavior."
"Evidence. Logic. Facts. Differing opinions. Freeing slaves. Helping poor people. Education. Healthcare. Technology. Multiculturalism. Child labor laws. The minimum wage.

The one good thing about the 1950s--a higher tax rate on the rich--is the one thing they hate.
"As someone alive in the 50s, their desire is for a 50s that never existed for anyone who wasn’t a white, Christian man. A time of segregation for Blacks and subjugation for women."

I’ll let you imagine the outcome. Only in their dream world would it make sense that they’d be remotely successful."
There is a need to conserve our history and culture. It’s possible to progress too far too fast and lose our way. However that’s not what concerns these people. They are most bothered by other groups of people getting freedoms or financial help. Same people who cry about welfare and unemployment insurance lined up for PPP loans they never paid back.
"I think the standard nomenclature now is ""Regressive"". Conservatives are no longer working for the status quo, they want to go *backwards*."
Reactionary.
"Yeah, and they can’t achieve that through democracy, so…"
I always make it a point to call them anti choice instead of pro life because theyre not pro life in any way.
True. But it’s definitely notable they don’t seem to mind the permanent changes to the environment or native animal populations.
"LOL, you are so on point. I will change it."
Completely true! They're not fond of NATO either
i swear i hear more people bitch and whine about vegans and how much they hate having it “shoved down their throat” than i’ve ever seen coming from a vegan. like they’re just making them into big boogeymen like usual
Obama once mentioned as arugula on the campaign trail and Fox News lost its mind.  Same thing happened when he ordered Dijon mustard on a burger.
And feeding them lies. Look at Santos.... not a truth out of him and conservatives are predictably quiet.
Partly correct. If you boil it all down its over race. Everything else is an means to an end.
Bud light tastes weird and .22LR is a perfectly good self defense round.
"Obama got criticized for his ""faggy"" beer choice at his ""Beer Summit"""

"More to the point- the 50's they want is from the perception of a middle-class white Christian \*CHILD\*.  Sure, there were plenty of problems back then, too, but the adults were worrying about them.

"Vegan Street, a vegan blog, had a cartoon that had a bunch of meatery advertising, and one couple is looking at a ""go vegan"" message, and the tag line is that vegans are pushing their views."
"Yes definitely, that's the 'New World Order' that they're always screeching about."
"i think filthy frank had a big impact on the whole “vegans are cringe” thing because he had like one bad experience with them and then dragged them through the mud on the internet. then everyone started, and then you got conservatives just villainizing and demonizing this group of people (yknow, their signature move) and talking to eachother about stuff “vegans” did even though it’s almost certainly rage bait that they keep falling for over and over."
That question is about 20 years too late to ask. But good for finally posing it.
That's a ridiculous question. You can't poison something that is poison itself.
"Can an organization poison itself? They were never ""poisoned."" There isn't a point where they once were good but then became bad. This is just who they are, and who they've always been."
"I'm currently reading Dark Money, Jane Mayers.  It's about how some really wealthy, very conservative people started bank rolling all kinds of right wing think tanks and university programs - they particularly aimed for Ivy League schools, because all the rest emulate them - to make very right wing economics and theories as mainstream as possible.  Think Kochtopus, after the Koch brothers, among others.

Winner-take-all Politics was another book about the same basic phenomenon.

It's amazing how well they were able to get millions of people to basically blame the victims of poverty for their own poverty.

Boomers get a LOT of crap from younger people for voting for a bunch of things that are harming all of us (I'm a boomer.)  But, many millions were poured into all kinds of propaganda to get so many of us to vote against our own interests, or for short-term benefits.  That's coming back to bite all of us, in a big way."
Yup. I’m doing an r/politics AMA on this stuff next Friday as I worked in GOP politics before switching parties in 2017. You are correct though.
"Exactly.

Right-wing media didn't make Reagan embrace evangelicals. That was the GOP making its own decisions.

  
Right-wing media didn't make the GOP welcome Dixiecrats. That was the GOP making its own decisions."
"What poisoned the GOP . . . Was not the echo chamber that was created, but the grift ! ! !

The GOP as able to keep the Religious Right at arms length, up until Reagan . . . Who gave them a seat at the table and access to money and power ! ! ! 

GW Bush said he was one of them and Trump gave them control of a branch of the federal government . . . 

When a small group of tax free hucksters and charlatans amass a fortune and power in a democracy . . . There will be poison ! ! !"
"So multiple things are poisoning the GOP, one being extremists in the Right Wing media.

However, you are also correct! And we even discussed most of what you posted about in an episode with David Corn. You will enjoy this.

"> Is there a limit where the government should intervene before people fall into poverty (in classic liberal theory)?

Judging by history, I'd say no. See the Great Depression."
"If they aren’t hurting others, they aren’t happy."
Guess they forgot about all the retired citizens that they are supposed to represent.
Anybody surprised by this?
They had all three rings of government and yet they wait till they have the barest of a slim majority and two rings stacked against them to pull this shit.
And yet Boomers will still vote for them in droves. This simulation is stupid now
"No shit. 

They plan on being a federal government wrecking ball. 

In fact they want the central government to only be comprised or the pentagon basically…

All other departments they want controlled by the state."
"Oh, it's a day that ends in -y"

"Way to go, boomers. You fucked yourselves hard on this one. Good luck."
Complete BS gesture on their part...They raised the ceiling often enough under Trump that he could add $8.6T to the national debt in four fiscal years. House members pretending to now be 'budget hawks' is simply just more GOP hypocrisy. Shame on them.
It's like they *want* violence
House RUpubliclowns are planning to slash their own throats.
Maybe this will be a wake up call to stubborn seniors who refuse to accept that these people have it out for them!
"I'm retiring in 9 years. Everything I have done financially the last 10 years has been done on the basis of having $xxxx coming in from SS every month. If these fuckers actually succeeded in cutting my SS, they will have millions of people just like me, marching on the Capitol. And a whole bunch of really pissed off old people will not look good for any politician.                      We vote."
"First, this is grandstanding. The House GOP rational members know this won’t happen. 

Second, it’s BS. 

>> ""We have no choice but to make hard decisions,"" Rep. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma, leader of the conservative Republican Study Committee, told The Post. ""Everybody has to look at everything.""

The hard decision would be to raise taxes to pay for things that the GOP want such as Social Security and Defence spending. The Republicans are chickenshit. 

Third, can the Republicans just try to govern. Just try. Please."
"The craziest part is theyll do this and be 100% responsible but as long as fox news, facebook, and conservative radio tell them that actually the democrats did it theyll completely believe it no questions asked and theyll be even more pissed off at democrats for something the very grifters they voted in did to them. Stupid assholes."
"It’s insane how low income people keep falling for it and keep voting for them when they consistently, lower taxes on the rich, cut all benefits for the working class, including their schools, roads, parks and hospitals, and generally raise lower income taxes (except for smaller cuts which expire)"

"The GQP only care about 2 things, MONEY and POWER. They would sacrifice their own family to do it."
"""This really hurts our bases' own self interests;... they'll love it."""
"If, by some odd chance, this does get passed, does that mean we won't have SS and medicare taken out of our check each week?  And when do we get back what we already put in?"
Because they have to pay for the 1.7 trillion dollar tax give away that Trump signed after they pushed it through Congress without having a way to fund it.
"senate (dies) , or failing that veto... next?"
"And the debt limit gets closer to default.

If all the Republicans hang together, they can force either S.S. & MC cuts or a US debt default.

That's the theory they are operating under."
They aren't too far away from making it a reality. They have the House. They will most likely get the Senate in 2024 and possibly the White House too. They have the Supreme Court so all they have to do then is eliminate the Senate filibuster for this one act and it's done.
Yeah no shit
Thank God it will likely die in the Senate.
The Senate will defeat it. Joe Biden will veto it.
Cool. They can pay me out now.
"Man the democrats are crushing us, the republicans are crushing us. It’s almost as if they are working for the same people"

At least we know this will be vetoed or die in the senate
Plan <> do
It’ll never work so I guess good for them.
"So, to be clear, this is all about showboating to their anti-government base. They had a supermajority under Trump and could have passed this anytime during Trumps administration, instead it was reverse anything the Dems had passed, remove regs on pollution, spend spend spend, and cut taxes for the 0.1 percent. At no time did they mention debt, Social Security or Medicare."
It really seems that way.
Who do you think votes for these assclowns?
Yea those retired citizens won't care as long as they are owning the libs...
They'll just blame the Democrats for forcing the Republicans to do the thing.
"Yes.

All of the disabled constituents and parents, grandmothers, grandfathers, aunts uncles, neighbors, friends, and everyone else in between that rely on social security."
Ironically its these retired citizens voting these clowns in.  It's like these retirees want less money and healthcare when they need it most

"They have threatened it for a long time.

It's been their message, and many people have thought they weren't serious about it."
McCarthy is stroking the junk of every RUpubliclown wacko Congressman like a brothel madam in a labor dispute. 😎
Republicans are not logical.
Not everyone voted for them. We have the Senate and POTUS.
"Their proposals will not touch those currently on SS, only those below that. They don’t care at all about your contribution, they don’t like that your employer has to match it."
"And if they succeed in taking benefits, when they realize the payments they receive decreased, they’ll blame Biden, democrats, and probably Obama and Hillary Clinton, maybe even George Soros."
It’s white non-college educated Boomers that consistently vote Republican. A majority of whites have voted for the Republican presidential candidate in every election since Nixon in 1968. Democrats only win by better nonwhite turnout and trimming of the white vote down closer to 50%.
"They want a militaristic autocracy.

There are sane people in the country that won't let that happen."
I know. Glad I brought my shocked face to work today.
"We all know there's not a snowballs chance in heck that this would ever go to the senate and get passed, and then on to Presiden Biden.

Thank goodness for the blue majority in the Senate.

The thought that they are considering doing something like this is horrific, IMO."
"If it did, then America itself would go bye-bye much sooner.

If Republicans really “love” America so much, then why are they trying to kill America? My guess is because they’re trying to “own the libs” but the country is just caught in the crossfire of their arrogance and blatant stupidity."
Nothing to vote in as that won’t be in it.
"They're acting like they'll hold payments on the national debt hostage, which feasibly would give them more leverage, but they'll cower away and try to spin the debt negotiations as resulting in more irresponsible spending because of democratic intransigence."
Correction : You’ll all share the same trailer.
Have you checked out trailer prices and lot fees?
"Does the expression ""third rail of American Politics"" mean nothing to them?"
"Very much so!

They had to raise the ceiling really high in order to get his tax plan through for all of his rich friends. 

The tax plan is great for his friends and the changes made will last forever. 

For us regular folks? The changes he put in start disappearing in 2025."
They're doing a great job of reminding everybody why they are where they are now.
It's sad.
It's like they are living in a different reality.
"These cuts won’t affect them, it will effect future retirees."
"Current beneficiaries should be OK unless they pass laws to take away their benefits, too.

It's future beneficiaries that will see changes.

I am hoping that the Senate and President Biden are able to withstand their blackmail attempts
."
It means benefits will be cut. No money would ever get returned.
"It means benefits will be cut for future beneficiaries.


You would still pay into the programs because if you did not? When you were retired, there would be nothing there for you."
"Yes.

They will blame us for sure."
"Yes.

Many people don't seem to know that."
"I could live with the default as it will cause pain across much of America, not just the elderly, most of whom depend on SS just to eat and Medicare which allows them to receive basic medical care.  It should not be only the elderly who should suffer, but everyone, in order to show the republican base just how stupid these clowns are.  Sorry, not sorry!"
"Debt limit I can see held as blackmail to force reduced spending in other areas for sure. 

BUT that happens every year, I mean hello, we have annual government shut downs because of this & in those glorious days where only essential people work, the country runs just fine if not better."
I want to know who's downvoting you. Republicans taking the presidency and senate is NOT out of the realm of possibility.
"Yes!

The Senate will never approve any measure to cut these programs."
It would never pass as a bill. However? I believe they plan on using it in a blackmail scenario with the budget.
It does not work that way. This will affect your future benefits. It does not mean that you stop paying into the program now. It just means that in the future? They won't give you as much money that people receive now.
They might care if they lost their income.
"Which is ironic because they wont even be owning the libs, the current elderly class are more white and wealthier than each generation after them so that means theyre more conservative and the cut to social security and medicare will hurt majority conservatives. The crazy part though is that theyll just get told on fox news that democrats did it and theyll believe it."
"Yes, they will. Medicare/SS has always been the third rail of politics because senior citizens get up in arms about it if anyone so much as goes near reformation of these benefits and seniors are the most consistent voting block. McCarthy appears to be backing off already."
"They always blame the democrats even when it is something they have done that is so outrageous, so unbelievable, that people just are immune to it now."
It boggles the mind that those idiots think Republicans will do the cut oppos6of what they've been campaigning on for decades
"It seems logical. Throw out a demand they have know won't fly, cave to raising the debt ceiling to avoid catastrophe, and say they did the right thing when the democrats were ready to ride the default wave right to disaster.

It's beyond cynical, it's outright fucked up, but it's calculating."
"They raised it 3 times under Trump, now it seems to be a issue, but no surprise."
Shanties then
I guess you just don't understand the GOP.
"Not if Democrats get quality candidates with logical thinking. In less than 2 years the country leadership has never been worse. 

We just need new blood, Kamala is a disaster and the only reason why I pray for Biden’s health and Biden is a HUGE failure.

I reaaaally miss the Obama days :( Hell Obama would not even endorse his own VP until AFTER he got the nomination, that was not the most inspiring Endorsement. Your VP should be the ideal person to lead if you go down, his VP runs for President and it was crickets from him:"
They won't though it will kick in down the road after they have gotten theirs and will hurry the young voters who they vote as Dem and minority others.  If it hurts them in any way they will act shocked.
"Sure they will, but you know who they will blame for that happening?

Democrats."
Tents
"Yes.

Sad but true."
">Biden is a HUGE failure.

He's really not.

Kamala is a disappointment but not a shocking one (and hardly a disaster, you need a sense of scale in your word choice.. it's a bit dramatic)."
"The GQP are not a political party, they’re a full blown fascist propaganda organization, masquerading as republicans.
But, it’s up to Democrats that WE voted for to represent US, who are also at fault. They’re simply awful with messaging & fighting back with a loud vengeance on our behalf. They are lame wimps & I’m so ick of it.

They are afraid because the outrage machine, the ridiculous talking heads, have convinced them that there is something to fear. That someone else is trying to control them.

We didn't used to be so afraid, but here we are. Going day to day telling everyone we are the best, believing whole-heartedly in ""American Exceptionalism"" yet someone who is an expert at twisting reality (and little else) tells us we need to fear our fellow Americans or their ideals.

I have been around this country and a few others and the one common thread I have experienced is that most of us just want to live and chase opportunity. But where this machine excels is convincing us that we are so different, we can't talk to each other and discover this fact. Probably because if we did, we wouldn't need them."

It's quite unbelievable that the legislature in Iowa (Republican majority) wants to try to get a waiver from the USDA to make sure people on food stamps can't purchase real food - like fresh meat.

>*A proposed bill could prevent Iowans who use the former Food Stamp Program from purchasing various pantry staples.*

The legislature wants to control the types of food they are allowed to purchase and prepare for their families.

>*A new bill introduced by Iowa House Republicans last week could drastically cut the types of food that people in the state can buy using Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits.*

They want to restrict food stamp recipients so that they can only purchase foods that families who are on the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Nutrition Program are allowed to purchase.

>*To safeguard the health of low-income women, infants, and children up to age 5 who are at nutrition risk by providing nutritious foods to supplement diets, information on healthy eating, and referrals to health care.*

Does anyone know why WIC was established? Do they care? 

It was specifically geared towards pregnant women and their children who, it was decided, need a certain type of food to nurture their bodies and their babies through important development stages in their lives. 

>*The proposed waiver would restrict SNAP purchases to items that appear on the state’s approved food list for a different federal initiative, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children. Also known as WIC, the program provides food assistance for pregnant people, new mothers and young children, and it is significantly more limited than SNAP. ""Iowans on SNAP would not be able to buy meat, flour, butter, cooking oil, frozen prepared foods,” Luke Elzinga, the chair of the nonprofit Iowa Hunger Coalition, told Iowa’s News Now. “It’s a huge list.” In lieu of fresh meat, canned salmon and tuna would be allowed, according to a list of Iowa’s approved WIC foods. In addition to pantry staples like flour and oil, other prohibited items would include canned soup and sliced cheese. Only brown, and not white, rice would be permitted, and shoppers would have to swap white bread and pasta for 100% whole-grain versions.*

SNAP is totally different. It's for the entire family. They want to ban:

■ all fresh meat (and replace it with canned salmon and tuna only)

■ white rice (and replace it with brown rice)

■ flour

■ butter

■ cooking oil

■ frozen prepared food

■ sliced cheese

■ canned soup

■ regular pasta (and replace it with wheat pasta)

And what about people who can't eat the food listed above because of dietary restrictions?

And why no fresh meat?

Strange.

>*In addition to limiting eligible foods, the bill would also impose multiple restrictions making it more difficult for people to qualify for SNAP in the first place.*

And why make it harder to qualify for food stamps? 

Many people are on food stamps actually have jobs. Yet they don't make enough money to support their families and buy food. So the government gives them food stamps. 

Now, they want to add more restrictions to the ridiculous restrictions that already exist? So that people who really need food stamps will no longer qualify.

If you are poor? You can't save money or try to get out of your poverty status because the government is saying that you can't have any attributes of trying to improve your life.

My neighbor and his wife receive $ 517.00 per month for EBT / food stamps due to the pandemic. All food stamp recipients received additional food stamps due to the pandemic.

They just received a letter stating their EBT benefits will be reduced to $ 23.00 per month (after the pandemic EBT goes away), after  February 2023. They are on disability and they received an 8.9 % increase. 

The 8.9 % increase in no way, shape or form, makes up for the food benefits they are losing. Or the higher costs for goods and services they currently pay.

They are not the only ones.

It's very difficult for everyone.

Food Banks are closing, or not staying open as long.

People and corporate entities are not donating as much.

Shelves are empty.

Also? 

I think one of the worst things you can do is drastically decrease the pandemic level food stamp coverage so many Americans rely on.

And why are the Republicans supporting this proposed legislation to keep Americans and their families from real food? Including spices?

Do they think Americans, especially the disabled and elderly, deserve to be hungry?

It's not like the disabled and ederly can go get a job tomorrow to make up for all of the money that is being taken away from them through this proposed legislation.

Just? 

Why?

Edit - Added part about WIC. Fixed syntax. Added YouTube link."
the poor people that voted them in are going to get screwed
and the people on SNAP who voted for the GOP are still just going to blame the Democrats for this
Funny how the war on poverty became the war on poor people.
"Conservatives - We can cut food stamps because you can live just fine on cheap goods like beans and rice.

Also conservatives - Look at these gourmets with their fancy beans and rice.  I'll put a stop to them!"
Because F*^% poor people’s health right?
"They want to go back to the good old "". Government cheese"" when you had to get food from the government at certain places only. I remember when I got WIC for my kid. This is over 40 years ago and the kid had to be under 2. You could only get milk, cheese and I believe special k. There were no beans, or juice or anything like that. I personally don't think this list is terrible. It's having people eat actual good food instead of simple carbs and fat. The tuna and salmon are probematic because of mercury. As for  fresh meat, 6.99 a lb for one meal.for 4 to 6 people. ..while surely a 1.00 4 oz can of tuna( with mushroom soup and noodles) is enough for dinner...in their thinking. The suggested switches don't cost more and in some cases cost less. I was never able to eat lobster on food stamps, not sure why people think that's what being bought."
Poor people don't need food that's ridiculous.
Must punish poor people.
"They are stuck on the “worthy poor” idea, are really afraid of the welfare queen myth, and are disproportionately concerned about the internet stories of people buying lobster or steaks with food stamps. In their minds, the poor need to look poor; they need to look deserving. On a deeper level, they may also view poverty as a choice and want good food to be an incentive to climb out of poverty—as if anyone wanted to stay impoverished."
In neighboring Nebraska and the insanity is real in the upper midwest
Do you know who benefits most when people on SNAP buy fresh foods? Farmers…farmers in the Midwest. Once again the GOP is working hard to fuck their own constituents.
They want to kill poor people.

I hear other programs are in trouble.

The good thing is that the Senate won't approve ridiculous bills that the House of Representatives want to press through."
"Yes!

I bet you they will."
"I agree.

It's truly amazing people are even considering this idea."
"Why let them have joy via full stomachs?

And what about people who can't eat the food that is on the approved list? What happens to them? They may have dietary restrictions or health issues going on. 

Don't they care about them either?


Ummmm.


No"
"There are articles out there about people standing in line behind people who are purchasing things like steak, lobster, scallops, or lamb, etc.

And they get angry about it and they write about it.

It goes on some complaint site.

There are currently no restrictions on what you can purchase with your food stamps in regards to the type of protein you are allowed to purchase.

IMO? 

If you want to purchase lobster and steak for you or your family?

And your food stamps offer the amount needed?

Do it.

I'm not going to tell someone that just because they are on food stamps, they can't have steak or lobster, etc.

I am not the food stamp judge.

And as of today? They have every right to do so where I live."
"If you are poor? Don't save money or try to improve your lot in life.

And don't eat food unless it's the kind of food that we say you can eat."
"So true. 

You hear stories every day about so-called welfare queens or kings. 

They were approved for food stamps. 

You have to jump through a lot of bells and hoops to get food stamps. 

They look at your bank accounts, your social security number, bills, rent or mortgage, paychecks, who you live with, and more. 

So what if you want to buy steak or lobster with your food stamps? You are allowed to do that.

So if you see someone in line buying these types of things? So what? It is food. It is purchased for their families. They will eat it. That is what food stamps are for.

I don't begrudge people buying whatever they need to buy on their food stamp allotment. Who am I to judge what they put in their mouths and stomachs?

After the pandemic level food stamps go away? Most people I know will go back to making less than $100 a month in food stamps.

My neighbor and his wife received a letter that their $ 517.00 pandemic level food stamp allotment is going to $ 23.00 per month (after February).

Not much.

They are worried."
It's pretty cray cray!
"Yes!

I'm in one of those states.

It's the farmers who will be hurt most.

Then the merchants and employees who sell the food.

And the consumer."
"Yes. Very much so.

Why else pass such ridiculous laws?"
"⬆️ 💯% fact!

Truly!"
I really wish these idiots would actually see what they are voting for.
If I recall there was a viral posting not too long ago with a picture of a receipt of someone buying all that stuff with SNAp and internet sleuths discovered the poster was the actually the person who made the purchases and was defrauding the program
"I live in Iowa. People always talk about Texas and Florida, but nobody thinks about Iowa. Republicans have every position. Take a look at Brenna Bird.

Just this week a bill was passed to give funding to private schools. This means public schools will have less money and that the state will be paying religious establishments. 

It's scary here in Iowa."
"I don't think they care about their constituents.

As long as it is labeled as coming from the Republican platform.

They will vote on it.

Sad but true."
"Sad but glad they were caught.

It is OK to purchase things like that, though.

At least for now.

We will see the Republican agenda unfold.

If they could?

I bet my neighbor and her husband's  $ 
23.00 per month in food stamps will be slashed.

They currently earn $ 517.00 per month in food stamps due to the pandemic. After February? It's going to $ 23.00. They just got a letter.

How will they survive?

Sad."
"OMG.

I heard about various jurisdictions passing these types of laws. I think that's horrible. Truly horrible.

Why take money from a public school system that is already drained? Where teachers have to buy supplies, among other things?

I live in Washington State, and I hear from people that come from Iowa to work here all the time about what it's like to live there."
Welp I should add the person who posted it and was caught was trying to spread the narrative look how people are abusing this program. As it turned out the right wing nut job once again was projecting
"Yeah, it's a great state to live in for safety and housing costs, but it sucks for government."
"Excellent and all have a lot of common sense.  I hope at least we start with expanding the Supreme Court and a presidential election by popular vote.  I really like the ranked-choice voting.  Interesting that the Democrat senators represent so many more people, how does that not compute to winning more elections.  I have a feeling it is the ""dark money"" which obviously needs to be abolished."
"Speaking specifically on your proposals for the legislative branch, both of those ideas would never be passed into existence and are nonstarters.

What you seem to really be complaining about is the power of state government versus federal with respect to the number of citizens. Your proposals would require that the majority of states pass a constitutional amendment that gives them less power while concentrating power into larger states. Non starter.

Furthermore, let’s say both your changes were enacted into law. Congress would become significantly less efficient than they are now. The new Senate you propose would just be a term restricted version of the current house. The new house would almost double in size with even more concentration of power into large states. 

Letting the federal government further meddle into states affairs will have disastrous long run consequences for an individuals freedom to vote. 

Unless your goal is to shift us away from a republic to an authoritarian state, these legislative changes would make matters worse.

With all that being said, why are we reforming the legislature? Do you want them to pass more bills? Have more transparency? Less corruption? Your solutions are solutions without a problem and tinkering for tinkerings sake."
"For judicial, an 18 year term is somewhat appealing, but what is the point of expanding it from 9 to 13? That is a blatantly partisan move and nothing would stop Republicans from expanding it to whatever number would give them a conservative majority in the future? That’s a dangerous precedent. Interesting about the code of ethics, that can’t possibly be true? If it is that does need fixed immediately."
"I do support nearly all your voting rights suggestions. However, I would like to add a caveat that all election results must be tabulated within 24 hours. The long tabulation times just fuels distrust and conspiracy."
"We're governing in the 21st century using an 18th century document. Yes, it could stand some freshening up, but don't plan on it. It was made to be difficult to change."
"In reference to your comment on constitutional amendments, why does this country still worship an archaic, horribly outdated constitution written by white, slave owning elites from the 18th century? Lol we hold up that document like a shrine that can never be changed. You do understand most other developed countries in the world regularly update their constitutions to keep up with the times. The Constitution’s flaws have become ever more apparent as the country becomes more divided. For instance, a constitutional amendment requires the absurdly high approval of 3/4 of the states, an action that will never happen. Other provisions like the “2 state Senator” rule and the 3/4 approval of moving through constitutional amendments may have worked in 1789 when there were only 13 states and the population of the country was only 3 million. It doesn’t work in a diverse, modernized country of 50 states and 330 million people."
"No it wasn’t, Thomas Jefferson is known for saying  that the Constitution, as it was drafted in 1789, was never supposed to last 200 years, but rather that a Constitution of sovereign nations were meant to last every 20 to 30 years before receiving an update. America is an outlier in this respect; other countries don’t have this strange reverence for their constitutions like America does and this is preventing progress from being made."
"Yeah arguing about updating the constitution is certainly valid! I for one would be all in favor of an update. We could modify some language that’s more applicable to 2023 and clarify what we mean instead of letting the Supreme Court interpret it. Second amendment being a prime example. If we want everyone to be able to buy a bazooka, great let’s say that. If we want hunting rifles only, great let’s say that instead of this vague wording relating to militias that a room of ten people can’t agree what it means."
It was just folders with old playboy magazines stuffed in there so that “mother” would open them.
"I lived in the Kansas City metro area for the bulk of my life.  They are a liberal city in the midst of conservative rural areas.  It still affordable, but less so than it was 10 years ago.  I moved to rural Missouri 5 years ago, and even though there are a few Trump flags, the people are nice and I just don't talk politics.  


If you are nice people, you will be fine anywhere."
"I am a conservative that moved from California to the state of Tennessee. For the most part conservatives here in Tennessee do not mind the liberals moving here.
Obviously the joke is ""you can move here just don't bring your voting patterns with you""

But the cost of living here is night and day. A working class individual can actually buy a house out here and live. I myself have done it.

If you do move to a red state, the conservatives don't mind liberals moving here. It's all about respect. The key is don't become a Karen and start telling everybody how they're wrong and how they need to change their ways. Respect is always given and received, a large majority of conservatives here will respect you and your beliefs as long as you respect theirs also. We can all get along.

I don't know if my advice helps you at all. But hopefully it does as one Californian who is left to a state that has better affordable housing."
"Just move somewhere like Reno NV, you don't have to go all the way to a red state."
"I'm in Montana. Mostly we leave each other alone. Missoula is the liberal town and has a lot going for us lefties. It is cold about half the year, though. Lots of animals to care for, and hazmat sites to manage. No place is as good as California. I've lived in Oregon and Washington, too. The western sides are politically friendly, but you have to put up with rain and fleas all the time."
"Choose a purple state like AZ, NV, TX, GA, NC, PA, WI, or MI. There's plenty of liberal people in the cities, cheaper living, and your vote counts more."
"I’m a liberal living in a blue city in a VERY red state. I grew up in a blue state and took it for granted. Personally I would stick with a blue state for the amenities and social resources. They are just lacking here to an extreme extent, and our state government directly opposes its own citizens. It’s very affordable but I’m in the opposite situation as you - I’m ready to spend an arm and a leg to be around people and a government who respect me as a human being. Do your research on state laws and policies, and decide what is important to you and what you could sacrifice. Topics to start your research: diversity in government, social services by state, abortion laws by state. Lastly, you should know that California has labor laws and protections for workers that are far beyond any other state in the country. Be sure to research what exactly you are leaving behind before you make the move. Best of luck!!"
Colorado is full.
Chicago. For a big city its pretty affordable. I love it here.
"We have strong views but aren't very politically active (no bumper stickers or flags). I'm the type of person that will come to the defense of someone being subjugated, but I won't go out looking for a fight. I guess I just don't want to live somewhere where all my neighbors would resent me for having a hybrid car lol"
"We were considering Sparks - Definitely not what we expected compared to the rest of the state, and in one of, I think, two blue districts?"
"Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho are beautiful, but it seems that they're a holdout for extreme right wingers. Thoughts on that whole American Redoubt thing?"
"Same here. I won't let blatant racism or cruelty to pass without speaking up.  You definitely wouldn't have a problem in KC with the hybrid, and I seriously doubt there would be a problem in the Ozarks where I currently live.  I was a little surprised to see Tesla chargers in the Hy-Vee (midwest grocery chain) parking lot in Osage Beach, MO."
"Yeah Reno and LV are blue, some of the rural towns can be a bit scary but same can be said of California or any other state."
I keep guns. Those are my thoughts. I'll be damned if I'm going to live in a christian ethno-state.The extreme plan is to burn it down and head for Oregon.
"Heard on the local news:    
""DeSantis culture wars started with 'Don’t Say Gay', now it's 'Don’t Say Black'""."
"Every far-right GOP official needs to be asked why they want to bring back chattel slavery. Even assuming they don’t want to do that, it would be funny to put them on the defensive and watch them squirm."
Wow! 🤔
And this is a surprise? The Right-wing is afraid of true democracy.
"Trump: hundreds of documents

Biden: 2-3 dozen documents


Trump: Obstructed justice 

Biden: Cooperating with authorities 


It's really a night and day difference, but at the end of the day...yes, it should be investigated."
"He is being investigated. It's sloppy and care less but unlike Trump not criminal since Biden didn't hide it, is cooperating and invited the FBI to search his home again unlike Trump who took them on purpose, refused to give them back and it required a subpoena to actually get the documents."
"That Trump’s documents should face the same scrutiny, speed and outrage by the gop and press"
"Another infamous Uncle Joe gaff, but doesn't go anywhere even CLOSE to the criminal handling of tRUmp's espionage."
I feel Republicans revel in false equivalencies.
Meh
"The whole way classified documents is handled in the US is like a keystone cops episode. The more you find out about the way our government works, the more you go WTF."
"It should be investigated and if he's found to have done something wrong, he should be held accountable (see how easy that is Republicans?)"
I’m just pissed that they are probably going to let trump off because of this and because they know republicans don’t care about all if the very important details.
"Biden and Trump need to face consequences for there actions, one was unintentional and when documents were found authorities notified and immediately turned over, the continued search of properties was not interfered with, the other was intentional, documents were taken, lied about the documents, ignored subpoenas, forced by search warrant to retrieve and lawyers hired to interfere with process.  Both Biden and Trump must face consequences and should be based on intentional and unintentional actions. IMO."
"Seems our government doesn’t keep very close watch over what are supposedly sensitive information. I mean, this is from like 9 years ago and it hasn’t been missed?"
"Yes, I believe he should for the reason I thought Trump should be. These are classified documents that referenced methods, sources and people involved in several national security operations and it needs to be identified why they were not properly stored in a SCIF or vault, as is normally the case.  

I also believe it should lead to some serious reforms regarding how classified documents are handled by lawmakers in the legislative branch (since some docs he had date back to his Senate days) and executive branch officials because this is dangerous stuff that sends some signals to our adversaries we don't want sent.  


If anyone else did what he or Trump did, they'd be prosecuted."
"I think it’s interesting the investigation came out immediately after Republicans took control of the house and after McCarthy gave the extreme right what it wanted, to include appointing some of their own to key oversight and investigation committees. 

It’s interesting that Biden is being hit with and bathed basically with the same charges that Trump is…

It’s even more amazing how no one sees the connection here."
Biden needs to take his lumps and start planning for his replacement. I'd still vote for him again over any Republican but not sure others would. He's technically in a good position for a bait and switch where he can keep Republicans focused on him while Democrats quietly plan his successor.
"I'm waiting for more info.  What was the nature of the documents?  If they were covertly taken from a SCIF, hidden, lied about and willfully mishandled?  That's a crime that people do real time for.

We're they news stories that we're still classified after they were widely reported?  then I don't care at all."
I think this is more common then we realize. The only reason it came out was because of Trump. They needed to disclose it otherwise it would seem more fishy then it really is
I’m sick of hearing about it and the false equivalence. Come on my god it’s not hard to see the difference between the two
"Everyone has to be accountable to the law, regardless of the party, who we voted for, or what our personal feelings are about them. Biden is being investigated, as he should be.

Be that as it may, comparing the breadth and circumstances of what was found in Delaware to what was found in Mar-a-Lago is a false equivalence."
"I’d bet the farm that there isn’t a single elected official at the federal level that hasn’t mishandled a non zero amount of classified documents.

It does seem more like this was a case of “I took some work home and forgot some of it because I’m old” instead of “I took some secret documents home to hide and use for future gain”.

I think the context of the cases make them different but I don’t think he should be let off the hook just because I dislike him less."
Same as I do about the Trump documents
I think anyone who walks away with classified documents should be investigated
Yes it should be investigated. But so far nothing has indicated this is anything more than misfilled / lost paperwork
"My thoughts exactly. Pence should be investigated as well since classified docs were found at his home. Anyone who does this should be investigated. What I found laughable about Biden was his statement where he said everyone knows that he takes the handling of classified information very seriously. No no no you don't. Not when it's found in your garage, your house, your office and god knows where else. 

From the looks of it, they are all taking classified documents and they all should be held accountable. But will that happen? Very doubtful."
"It is a crime to have unauthorized classified documents.

https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCODE-2011-title18/USCODE-2011-title18-partI-chap93-sec1924"
"The trump charges for the documents was never going to be much, if at all. His real issue (charge wise) is obstruction. Lots and lots of obstruction. I never had much hope, and I have less now. But I still have some hope."
"No they weren’t covertly taken, they weren’t even on the archives list of items checked out. Bidens team found and reported them, then went looking for more just in case. This is all publicly available info right now"
Not if it's by accident. Bless your heart.
Yeah... It says that right there in the US code. Unless it's by accident.
Thanks but I'm going with the actual prosecutors on this one. And Davis Petreous.
"It's not about trust at all. Conservatives don't want a liberal democracy which is what America and the West was founded on. When conservatives say freedom what they mean is freedom from a liberal democratic government and replacing it with a fascist authoritarian dictatorship. This cannot be fixed. If you want a liberal democracy you need to fight for it and the moment you stop fighting for it, it will die."
"Of course we can't trust them to be decent. We can trust them to act cruelly and ignorantly.  
They purposefully spread a deadly disease.  
They put a Russian asset into the White House.  
They stormed the capital, killed police officers and tried to prevent the transfer of power.  
They supported the nomination of liars to the Supreme Court and celebrated when women's right to abortion was taken away.  
The threatened violence upon election workers, government officials and school board members.  
Nah.  We know what they are and what they will do given the chance. If we trust them again, shame on us."
"I hate to say it, but I think that the majority of neo-fascist conservatives are of the baby boomer generation (not all obviously but a good percentage). I'm hoping things get better when they are gone."
"The only way to regain trust in the system is to stop conspiracy theorists and racists from getting elected. Their wins have given rise to the idea that it's ok to be openly racist. When that happens, their numbers and influence grow. We have to remove the cancer, not get along with it"
"There are parts of America so incredibly different from others they may as well be another country.  If we can’t find a way to bring us all back together, maybe a divorce is best for all."
"I think people need to understand that both sides lie and say whatever to get elected. I’d also wager that present day Washington is a facade and outside influences pull the strings which is why Trump was attacked harder than any other President in history. He’s not a purchased insider. The liberal left LOVED him and he’ll Oprah even interviewed the guy asking years ago if he’d ever run in which he at the time didn’t want to. Once he announced then the attacks began. He was a threat to the agenda in place. 4 years kill lots of momentum so 8 years would have derailed a ton of items like Great Reset, social credit or carbon credit scores being floated now."
Covid broke this country for good.
"Well, that explains why nobody is enlisting in the armed forces. Because we’d be fighting so they can continue to make our lives miserable. 

We fight with our apathy and our ballots. We ignore their pleas for cooperation when they want it, we vote in every future election."
"That’s why I’m convinced in the next ten years AMERICA WILL DIE. Their precious union will dissolve because they chose to be ruthless, they chose to be violent, they chose to be unreasonable and we had to make the tough decision to dissolve the union entirely and build walls to keep THEM away."
"These people definitely had the worst Christmas ever. Explains why these Christian conservative families seem to be falling apart at the seams during the holidays nowadays. 

But my grandma isn’t a bad person, the one on my dad’s side. She’s a sweet old lady. She even baked me a cake for my birthday last year. 😁 

I know when she eventually passed away I’ll be crying and mourning for days and I’ll be giving her hugs in my dreams just like I do with my grandfathers when I see them in my dreams. Unlike the fascist baby boomers, they were great people. 

As for Conservative Republicans… there’s a reason why things keep getting worse for them. Bad people reap bad lives."
"I agree with you. Problem is, if they run around like children and shout “Don’t Tread On Me!” And act like they’re untouchable because they are crazy lunatics, eventually that gets too old for us and we start asking ourselves if being in this shoestring union is even worth the heartache.

There’s a difference between being cancer and being a doctor that wants to help people who have cancer. Cancer kills people and ruins lives and destroys families, cancer doctors, or oncologists, want to save lives and keep people from vast human suffering. 

America should 100% be asking itself moving forward if the current state of affairs is worth fighting for in the eyes and minds of its citizens. Because there’s not much trust, if any at all, between the citizens and between Americans."
There is almost no other part of the country that isn't at least 50% liberal across the board. The problem is the electoral college has skewed our democracy to make it appear we have a more event split across voters than we really do. Republicans are a minority. The electoral college needs to be fixed to provide what the Constitution promised and that is all voters are equal and have an equal vote.
"As tragic and sad as it seems, you’re right. A country like this in this world and with this amount of division, calling this country “United” is just irony at this point. 

If we can’t change, then a divorce is sadly up America’s alley."
"The liberal left never ""loved"" him. He was tolerated. It was during his campaign that he revealed more faults in his character and once he was in power, it became clear that he only wanted more. trump is the worst thing to happen to America in my 60+ year lifetime, and he has exposed all of those on the right for what they are."
Hope that $800B Aircraft Carrier was worth it 😂
No one is listing in the arm forces because people are much more informed today than they were during the Bush era and no one wants to die for another oil crusade by a right-wing fascist Republican.
I guess Republican Conservatives have never heard of the term “Kindess is its own reward”. Kindness makes kind people and kind people make more kindness in return. Same works when you only choose to give people reasons to want to keep you as far away from their loved ones as possible.
"Absolutely. I’m 24 years old and even I know that Republican Conservatives are not the brightest or the best. They’re the worst in many ways. 

In general, I think the best way to describe their sentiment is that they only care about THEMSELVES and THEIR MONEY. That’s a great way to describe it. 

If they hate something, they’re gonna ruin it (like women’s rights to abortion). If we hate something, they’re gonna hurt us as much as possible so we don’t ruin it for them. (gun control legislation is a great example) 

They are the bad guys. They’re the bad guys because they treat others like garbage and through their actions they give us solid reasons to want to end the union; because we can’t let them hurt our families and our communities. They’re a THREAT to America’s future. And they don’t care. They’ll keep screaming “DON’T TREAD ON ME!” until America dies. And even then, they’ll be violent lunatics.

We CAN’T trust them to do the right thing. 

If tomorrow they choose to do a complete 180, expel people like MTG, Matt Gaetz, Clarence Thomas, Ted Cruz and Mitch McConnell from Congress, admit they were wrong and that they should’ve been focusing on the stability of our union and bringing equity and equality to all civilians, passing gun responsibility legislation that will prevent mass shootings, focusing on diplomatic relationships between The US and Mexico as well as other territories, focused on fighting back against climate change and helping ALL PEOPLE FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE? Really ensuring that America HAS A FUTURE AT ALL? I’ll have a whole lot of apologies to dole out."
"Like I said though, there’s bigger fish to fry. Can we fix this trust problem in America before America dies? 

I don’t know. I have genuinely no clue."
Or die so they can come home and be discarded and treated like trash like the last round of military vets
And the ones before that.
I’m perhaps unduly bothered by the misuse of their and incorrect punctuation on display here.
Most right wingers/hardcore evangelicals/fundamentalists are anti catholic.
"It used to be that Catholics were indeed a pariah politically. The assumption, largely more anti-immigrant than anything, was that Catholics were more aligned with Rome than ‘Murica. 

When Catholics were considered more “ethnic,” they were more likely to vote Democratic. The Roe decision and the hard right shift of the U.S. Conference of Bishops changed that.  

Historically, if you want an anti-Catholicism in politics, check out Al Smith’s Presidential campaign in 1928 and what the Hooverites flung at him."
"The KKK has been traditionally anti-catholic so, probably more than you think."
"I would imagine that there are quite a few republican evangelical members of the House and Senate that think only people that believe exactly like they do are christians. They usually also feel people that are not christiasns are not good people. We all know who these members are. Think of the people that are always spreading their hate and fear mongering of ""those people""."
There
Go read article VI of the US Constitution
"Although we seem to have a significant Catholic delegation embedded at the Supreme Court, there's no justification for anti-anyone politicians. It would suffice that they pursue the interests of the voters and not the Vatican's."
Church and State are separate.
Yes! They are called Protestants!
"What do you mean by, ""anti-Catholic?""  There are these priests that won't give Joe Biden Communion because he is pro-choice.  Does that make Joe Biden Anti-Catholic? I remember driving to work one day, and I was listening to some religious show on the radio, and the guy on the radio was railing against papists-I mean to the extent that the Pope shouldn't exist.  He was definitely anti-Catholic, but I didn't want anything to do with his type of anti-catholicism.  So I think your question is a little too vague."
"I think you will find a fair bit of that in fundamentalist and evangelical churches, particularly ones that are independent congregations with no theological oversight."
My grandmother (the racist one) wouldn't vote for Kennedy because of his Catholic beliefs. She was awful
"President Biden, Nancy Pelosi, Mallory Morrow (MI), the Kennedys were, just to name a few."
"Note: As a politician, you will not survive as an avowed anti-catholic"
"Was going to say that. 

You do have some Republican Catholics….like you also have some Republican Jews but the mass majority of them

Are Democrats …

What determines party is predicated more on where you live"
That changed in the civil rights era in some areas though
"When I was growing up evangelical, I think most peoples' perspective was that Catholics were ""saved"" but misguided. I specifically remember ""If you declare with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."" So I figured that was pretty clear that any Catholic who fit that bill got a ticket to heaven."
"We all know (from voting patterns) that conservatives care nothing for any children but their own, but because of the anti-abortion thing repugnicans will take any and all Catholic votes and say nothing of their private ""differences""."
"Officially, yes. In practice, no. Not at all."
"Biden is catholic.  If a priest refuses him communion, that is on the priest, not Joe.

Also, the pope ordered they provide him communion, so they are the issue, not Joe on this one."
I think mass majority of Catholics are republican. I’m a catholic democrat and am constantly criticized for my politics. People say I’m not a true catholic if I’m democrat. It’s terrible in the dating world. Very hard to find a catholic man that is moderate or liberal politically. At least in the Cincinnati area
"Yea, no. Most Catholics are conservative and Republican these days. Especially since Roe v. Wade in 73. You can blame that on Pat Buchanan (a Catholic) and Nixon. There is a reason the Federalist Society picked all Catholics for the Supreme Court."
"I once read Tim Tebow's father's website. It had on there that something like 75% of all Filipino people have never heard the word of god. At the time I looked it up and I think 95% of Filipino people were catholic. He also had derogatory things to say about ecumenical religions, which catholisism is one. I know people that believe only a baptism as an adult makes you a christian so the childhood baptism of catholics does not count."
I find it amusing that you think republicans care about their own children. They only care for the straight boys. Girls and any member of the LGBTQ+  community are second class citizens at best.
"Then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who is also Catholic, was also threatened with being denied communion because of her pro-choice stance.

I've not heard of this being levied against two other Capitol Catholics: Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA, who was Hillary Clinton's running mate in 2016), and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY14)."
"This is true of white Catholics, but not Catholics overall"
Yeah it’s bc the white Catholics in America have aligned themselves with the conservative Americans that look like them even if the views are antithetical to their faith.
"If they ever become powerful enough, they will get their turn."
I feel like finding a catholic democrat in my area is like a needle in a haystack! They are so focused on abortion.

The College Board has not publicly released the course framework & it’s not available (as far as I’m aware or have seen) In part because the course is still in development. 

However, previously during a pilot program of it, one Florida teacher (who taught the course) discussed some of the topics covered in more detail in this article [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/31/us/ap-african-american-studies.html?unlocked_article_code=qfdZhnz5-aqOqyU9cgVDqHXzRW36qrpLqOsI-0RoiRQ0wfX7ikLM4KvQ9z42su8qbH5jveU1yzXzh1V2mzl4RXakc3h7ieINj60WrddcWEMLlU50MAAcarYszBcQ0_aEfC4jKtkFNf8vaV4teV99Bfs4GSrZ-xD2_46UENkX63SBM7ozaWO54z47RfOEyHg1d8bVL1BJEzXOqLikUFrG-vy222I93xn8mQnJEz_-BXbTuuyk_kVm2w7ogUwbIYm7pTFgzYtCcQn4nQTz8JmIGbtqt4z0e2jOvfh0fQm3-sPZUfjXECuEdXHHTeVVEYayb59q2YirLJ4AAaMA8GRu2w&smid=share-url). They said though “that this course is a comprehensive, mainstream course about the African American experience.” 

When this teacher taught it (before DeSantis’s rejection) they had *not* been “worried about falling afoul of [Florida] laws that aim to restrict education about race.” Convincing me more so that this rejection was about optics & pandering more than any “content issue” with the course."
It was about black history so….CRT. The end.

Sounds like boofin’ with Squee.
"Being reported widely but ""secret""?"
Doesn’t matter because unfortunately nothing will happen to him.
have a little respect!
"Can't. Need to impeach him to get him off the bench, or aply enough pressure that he resigns but I don't see that happening."
This is the statement that leads me to think America is dead it’s just not buried yet
"I’m a lib.. 

The initial allegations against him were faked. 

Blaise-ford named 3 people, one her best friend at the time that could verify the party happened. All 3 said the party didn’t exist."
He deserves none.
She actually said those three probably wouldn't remember the party because it wasnt memorable. She passed a polygraph too. The main issue we should have is that these allegations we're never investigated. Idk if Ford was 100% telling the truth (she could be mistaking him for someone else) but it should have been investigated instead of ignored as has been brought to light.
This could be interesting in the courts if the professor gets the support he needs.

"This is the perfect genius plan by the gop, think about as long as he is in office the rest of us will be bitching and moaning for the gop to do something. By them standing behind him at all cost the worst they can be blamed for is poor judgement, a small price to pay to keep our attention off everything else that they do. It's all a distraction technique."
He played the voters in his district for suckers and gave a middle finger to the fundamental principals of democracy in doing so. The nation should have no time or energy for such a person. The Congress needs to expel him.
Is he challenging Elon Musk for the title?
I love how the media is falling all over itself to blame democrats…. The media fully responsible for creating a regressive society full of ignorant morons.

"I’m not sure if it was planned that way, but I’m sure McCarthy and his minions will use Santos (and MTG, Boebert, etc) that way."
"They could lose every non-GOP aligned voter in every race for EVERY electorally determined position.

Is it worth that?"
Definitely.
The GOP gave him committee seats and seems to be just fine with him.  The grift must flow
"Trump and the GQP seem determined to continue cementing their standing with the hardest core hardest right and care nothing about alienating everyone not in the cult. It's almost as if they are building an army to take America by force. ...oh, wait..."
Voters should make that clear to the GOP that they've got to expel this turd.

"According to CNN's account, there have been six tranches of documents for 24+ total documents found."
No. I think Klain was the COVID/Legislative era Chief and the next guy will be focused on Biden's reelection era.
"I understand no one knew of the documents. But once they were discovered, shouldn't someone have realized this was a political bombshell given the allegations against Trump? I'm reading this morning that polling is showing the public believes Trump's and Biden's classified documents scandal are equivalent even though you and I know they're not. Are you defending the White House's handling of this trickle-truthed scandal?"
"And how many more will we hear?

I think it's rank incompetence for the White House not to gather these up and make a single announcement. Polling shows that the Trump and Biden classified documents scandals are equivalent in the public mind."
"Well this appears to take all the pressure off anybody prosecuting Trump now, so my cynical side is thinking this was has become an “exit ramp” of some kind for DOJ to say 🤷🏻‍♂️ I guess we can’t do it now.  

Pisses me off but it’s too late now to undo this PR optics mess. There are elements in the party that are still Conservadem enough they never wanted Trump to be prosecuted. Just marginalized. This smells like pulled punches to me. Just a sour taste in the mouth and I think I can no longer (and will no longer) fight on this hill. 

Garland and the DOJ dithered long enough to have this scenario create enough wgataboutism that they will use it to justify why they won’t go further.  Even though they never wanted to go further anyway. 

I can’t say this was on purpose or that it was a lucky accident for them, but either way, the impetus and momentum are lost.  Other hills to fight on. This was a massive bungle. 🤦🏻‍♂️"
Biden's lawyers discovered them November 2nd. Public disclosure was in January.
"So what? The found them and notified the authorities, it doesn’t matter when they publicly announced it. They publicly announced it because it was beneficial to them but there was no reason they had to."
"They've publicly announced six times new batches of  classified docs.  According to new polling, the public believes Trump's handling of classified docs was the same as Biden's. Is your ""So what?"" comment based on your thinking that public opinion doesn't matter in politics?"
It’s not considered to be the same according to real polls. We don’t know the classification level or if they still classified . It can be as mundane as his own travel itinerary from years ago. Also Biden actually reads documents so it isn’t suspicious when he kept documents.
"I think we are in dangerous territory. If Trump is indicted, and every legal analysis I've read says his case is open and shut, I think Biden could get impeached. This is not helped by the public's confusion."
Biden will be impeached at some point because of the Republican Party being incompetent and beholden to idiots. This investigation doesn’t matter.
"Republicans have the House, Biden is already going to be impeached. Who cares what excuse they land on. The difference between a political impeachment and a criminal indictment will become abundantly clear."
*further off the deep end
Next up. Florida gets sued
To deny what's true and which easily can be proven as such comes down to A LIE ....
“But he’s not a racist! “ I hear on a daily basis from dumb people on the right down here.
"Florida just going for the straight up old school institutionalized racism.  What's up next, redlining neighborhoods and segregated dining?"
"In case nobody reads this article (mostly hides behind a paywall), it's not banning AP African American studies class, here's what it's doing as quoted by the New York Times article:

*""Florida will not allow a **new** Advanced Placement course on African American studies to be offered in its high schools, stating that the course is not “historically accurate” and violates state law.""*

This new AP class is part of a small pilot program by the College Board (which oversees AP studies) that involves 60 schools (around the US) out of 26,000+. This pilot program is being tested until 2024, as noted on the College Board website. Pilot began in 2022.

Out of 4000+ colleges in the US, currently only 200 will accept the pilot credit for this AP class have committed to accepting credit for this class or will accept it once the pilot period is over. More colleges will commit to it once the refining process of this class is complete.

I felt that clarification was important to note as the title of the article reads to be somewhat misleading. How anybody feels about it beyond that and after reading the article is certainly up to them.

*Edited to include more information.*"
"They can't get sued. Or rather, such a lawsuit would be thrown out; this is a pilot AP class. It's not an official AP class as AP African-American studies was only just implemented in 2022 on a test basis. The governing body of AP classes is College Board and  they've currently enlisted 60 high schools in this pilot program. Through this test period, College Board will make changes and refine the class over before releasing it as something official. This needs to happen before the majority of colleges agree to accepting credits for this class."
"Since you put such an emphasis on new, is there and *old** AP course that is taught in Florida?"
You said it’s not banning the class it’s just banning the class. In more words
I don’t see how it’s that’s a relevant distinction
"While that isn't a ban directly, the fact that it ""violates state law"" shows that it is effectively a ban. Imagine if a Nazi came to the conclusion that Jewish-German history violates German law, you know the real reason for it."
Thank you.
defendants can ALWAYS be sued
"No. In fact there is no old AP for this anywhere.

This is a part of a pilot program by the College Board ,(they govern and regulate all AP classes in the United States) that launched in 2022 among 60 schools out of 26,000 high schools. From the pilot phase they'll decide what to adjust within it the class.

Out of 4000+ colleges in the US, currently only 200 will accept the pilot credit for this AP class.

Once the AP class has been refined, most colleges will commit to accepting it as college credit."
Yes I don’t see the distinction here. It’s literally banning the class.
"It's relevant in that there is no ""old"" AP class of African American studies. This is currently a pilot program (started in 2022) being applied to a limited number of high schools (60) by the College Board, which governs and regulates AP classes.

College Board is still making changes and refining this course ad the pilot program continues through 2024. Open to input from States and districts where the pilot program is occurring. The governor of Florida has already stated his concerns about some of the content in the AP class, which the New York Times article addresses.  The NYT article also noted that Florida would be open to reinstate in the pilot program if these issues were addressed."
"And… DeSantis said you can’t teach it in Florida. How does focusing on this nuance chance anything?

Ok, so it’s still being refined… so they won’t participate in even improving it? And oh by the way, the article mentioned one of the 60 pilot schools this year was in Florida."
"Here is my gift to Hollywood…. Blockbuster movie plot, some soccer mom goes crazy on the NRA after a school shooting.  I could go into way more detail but don’t need to be on a watch list."

They should just repeatedly call for a no confidence vote on McCarthy.
Possibly dumb question: I thought McCarthy agreed to step down if one member demanded it?
"Gop is gonna make life hell. It's only gonna get worse. I'm sure they are going to further fuxk with voting and everything to ensure a gop president next election, even if the votes say otherwise. 
When was the last time gop won the popular vote? 
I think they know without doing sone drastic ahit that they would ""die off"" or slowly fade away. The majority of the party. 
Be prepared I'd say. It's gonna be a wild ride and not in a good way."
But then who would replace him?  Devil you know vs Devil you don’t….
The GOP already made it clear they're going to ignore the Dems if they try that
McCarthy is a dick anyways
One person can call for a vote to remove him.
I think it triggers a vote.
I think that was one member of the Speakers own party.
"Apparently that was a ""suggestion"" not a ""rule"""
"Their end goal is ""reinstating"" trump. No matter what they say otherwise"

Damn right!

"Is it ""affordable"" now?"
"Used Obamacare once, it was pretty bad. I’m SURE it was a scammer who got my info but once I got a job again I had someone call from a number that WAS a government number…while it was free healthcare and the lowest quality possible, they said that their records show I am working again and asked for the back pay of the cost of the healthcare. 

Like it was free until I got a job and then it’s paid by me afterwards…I never paid it and went off on them so why I assume it was a scam call via a data leak. Spoofed number perhaps.

It was when Obama was still in office. It for sure needs improvement, by like….a lot!!"
"My neighbor pays $ 1.25 per month.

It used to be $ 8.11 per month."
"So what healthcare do you have now?

Btw, it's the ACA. 'Lowest quality possible' Explain? 

There are guarantees, ie: annual physicals, no lifetime limits, guaranteed coverage ( no preexisting condition denials) etc..

 If you're employed and covered by the employers health insurance, that's good. If you're on your own, the alternatives aren't good.."
"I remember. Obamacare was very expensive. It was great for the poor, and for people with pre-existing conditions.  It took care of a lot of headaches.  But for middle class people who were self-employed who needed to provide their own insurance, it was very expensive."
"Until I switched jobs, I was paying $600 a month for just me and my daughter. Luckily we found an employer with good benefits. The Democrats were dead set against socialized medicine, and will always be."
"Obamacare continued the same song-and-dance that we had before Obamacare.  High premiums force you to take the lowest possible coverage.  Then the next year they raise your rates, so you raise your deductible. Then the next year, they raise your rates again, so you switch to another provider (if there is one available). Then the next year they raise your rates. And so on."
That's a lie. ONE former Democratic senator (Joe Lieberman) was against the public option and said he would support a filibuster if Democrats included it.
Funny how there is always that one loud voice that won’t go along and forces the rest to give up their dream.
"The Democrats were weak-willed, and lacked leadership, but they were slaves to the private healthcare system. Do you actually think Pelosi or Biden ever gave socialized medicine a second look? Or Obama for that matter?  
And even the ""public option"" was a weak substitute for the great healthcare systems they have in other countries.  
Obamacare was a gift to the private healthcare industry."
You obviously don’t understand the filibuster
"Lieberman has been gone for a decade!  What have the Democrats done to move us closer to socialized medicine? Biden's ""improving Obamacare"". Is Lieberman still stopping him?"
Conservatives are liars and hypocrites?!?! No way!
"DeSantis is Trump 2.0.  We must fight like hell to never allow him into the oval office.  Sick fascist.

No more Trumpians in office!"
Those companies are like a person that is being abused.   If I try just a little bit more then maybe I won't get hit tonight.  DeSantis has the stench of desperation about him.   He so wants to be president so he can be an even bigger bully.
Backroom benefits for these companies? Things are never ax they seem.
"Jesus Christ are Republicans trying to dress like Serena Joy now?

"It’s getting to the point where I’d prefer Trump be the nominee again in 2024, because I think there’s a better chance that Biden beats him in the general election than DeSantis."
This might energize the base but I don’t think it’s a winner. The democrats seem to systematically ignore kitchen table issues that could broaden their appeal.

"If your only source of news is news that comes from Democrats, you're still in the echo chamber."
Right? Something I try to remind myself of daily.
Same as if the only news comes from Republicans. But no one said that was the only source of news they were looking for. If they are on Truth Social then they clearly aren't only getting news from Democrats.
"Passively agree. But I frequented republicans news for a better picture of what the country is thinking and seeing. I ask my mom to send her republican news clips she is interested in.

I don't trust most news now. It's all designed to poke at a some group or demographic."
"She was the first to be bounced out in the primaries, she’s a bad pick."
"She doesn't inspire me,  her stump speech is boring. Sorry to say but I believe that is super important. Ideas and policy should be the focus. It's not!"
"This is the only way we lose to Trump.

The single most striking thing I've learned working in politics is how unabashedly racist and misogynistic this country is, more even than one would suspect on the surface. Obama won because he was a generational political talent. Kamala ain't that."
"I liked her in Senate hearings and was excited when she started her campaign, but she had no traction.

Some candidates don't do well, but are good candidates who maybe run at the wrong time or something else is an issue. I feel that Booker is a good example. I don't think that's the case with her. It's just not her strength."
Nope...
"Why? My impression of her is that she is a terrible leader and a bad boss.

Why would we want her as VP let alone Pres?"
I'm not sure she could beat Mitt to be honest.
Biden is going strong just look at the Midterms
"as much as I want to back this I feel like Pete has a better chance, Smart, Vet, quick with a good but not controversial come back, young so he'll connect with millennials better.  Really struggling to find a downside to him other than all red states completely losing their shit over the obvious stuff but they lose their shit over everything so no matter who runs they'll hate them no matter what, might as well as put one of our most promising candidates forward.  His running mate, fuck it how about AOC so we can get some progressive input/ representation, honestly that ticket would sing so well to the millennials/ gen z's that they would come out voting in full force."
Absolutely not. Horrible pick.
Nope! Not her. She was a terrible choice for Veep and would be a disastrous president.
HELL no
Biden shouldn't run at all and Kamala should run in a primary like everyone else.
She doesn’t really stand a chance I don’t think. Especially against DeSantis or Trump. Those two can rally people behind them and Kamala doesn’t have that mass appeal. Kamala v Desantis would be a steamroll in my opinion as deSantis not only has a political spotlight on him but since he also is viewed by some Republicans as more moderate because he doesn’t make as many mean tweets but he still “owns the libs”.
Throwing away the presidential incumbency advantage is strategic malpractice
"Not many people like her. She can’t even speak coherently at times. Probably someone else. DK who, but someone"
Why not neither?
Someone would have to find her first. Laziest vice I've ever seen.
"Nah, we need a fresh face.  I’m not sure who that is but it shouldn’t be Biden or Harris."
Who?
Some one who fights for progressive agendas should be
I wouldn't mind if she does.
"What executive capacity or legislative capacity has Kamala shown that makes you think she'd be as good or better at the job than Biden? Her 2020 campaigned failed due to mismanagement. As a former prosecutor, my read is her 'best self' will be in the Federal judiciary. Maybe on SCOTUS when Clarence Thomas dies..."
"Not a chance. One issue that makes her an immediate no-go is that she is part of the prison problem, one of the worst as a prosecutor and AG."
If the GOP runs Lauren Boebert then maybe.
"Newsome & Katie Porter, 2024"
I was a big time Kamala fan. I preferred her over Joe. But what has she done?  She only appears when there is an African American cause.  I’m not a Joe fan either. I would love Jeffries or Pritzker.
I love kamala but no that wouldn’t be a good idea.  I do agree that I hope he doesn’t run.  I want someone more aggressive.  You are a trump fan tho and you know this would give him a chance to win lol
I prefer to win
Ask Hillary how doing well in the primaries did for her.
What stump speech? Can you be any more ambiguous!
Your impression? That sounds self-centered and narcissistic.
"
President Joe 8s doing great.
Don't change horses in the middle of the stream, imho."
"Pete 1,000%! (AOC is a ridiculous veep pick for Pete….she’s way too performative.) Our winning ticket is Pete Buttigieg and Lauren Underwood! 💪🏽💪🏽"
"'She can't even speak coherently'

That's silly."
"With you, Joe is just too old, period."
You must be too young to remember Dan Quayle.
"You say this based on what metric?  VPs are never in the news, so how do you know what she's done/hasn't done?"
"So because you personally can’t see her doing things, she’s lazy? How do you know what she’s doing or not doing? Were you always staying updated on Pence, and if so, how?

She’s traveling to Arizona today."
"I like both Katie Porter and Pete Buttigieg.  Katie Porter is unlikely to run as she’s going after a CA Senate seat and Pete Buttigieg, while exceedingly smart and well spoken didn’t seem to generate much momentum in the primary, so I’m not sure how he’d do this time around."
Someone who can get elected should be.
Look at her competition in that primary. They all sucked.
Didn't you watch her as a candidate?
He’s 80!! Stop being ridiculous.
okay that's definitely a ticket I can get behind
"I personally loved the part where they criticized her ability to speak coherently, but couldn’t even use complete sentences to do so. They probably not smart."
Period. Joe will lose to anyone under 70 years old. He loses to DeSantis. He loses to any of those fascists on the GOP side. We need youth and solid communication skills.
If they are they can't spell potato
If someone you vote for gets elected but doesn't represent your values that's ok?
You don't like his performance so far?
I'd rather have someone who represents 70% of my values and gets elected as opposed to someone who represents 100% of my values and doesn't get elected.
"He’s doing fine; however, it would be nonsensical to elect an 80 year old as POTUS. I’ve been wanting youth for 7 years now. As much as people pretend it doesn’t matter, age *is* a factor in our decision making and abilities—it’s the same reason why you can’t be under 35 and run for president. 

It’s time for a big dose of reality. People decline as they age."
"Ron DeSantis is youthful, and would definitely take the country backwards, and undo the progressive policies Joe Biden has enacted.

Age *is* a factor, which is why Biden is doing amazingly. It’s because of his decades of experience and wisdom. You’ve been wanting youth for 7 years now? Oh I’m so sorry you’re so *parched* and *dehydrated*. It’s competence and safety you should want.

Trump’s issue wasn’t his age. It was the policies he enacted."

He knows how the sausage is made, and would probably make a joke about how he’s so old that he *invented* the sausage.

I voted for Elizabeth Warren in the primary, and with hindsight I can now see that Biden is the perfect person for president right now.

Look at what else he’s making a priority:

Because someone said Medicare for all and that would do away with classism.
"Conservatives are stuck between two worlds, one world says government equals bad and unregulated markets equal good, the other world says I need affordable healthcare.

Obamacare is technically the middle ground but conservatives pretend to hate it because Obama. 

Medicare for all is the most cost effective approach for every one but they hate it because big guberment.

>Health insurance: Four health insurance programs — Medicare, Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace health insurance subsidies — together account for 25 percent of the budget in 2022, or $1.4 trillion.

>Defense: Another 13 percent of the budget, or $768 billion, will be paid for national defense activities. 

>Economic security programs: About 11 percent (or $665 billion) of the federal budget in 2022 supports programs that provide aid (other than health insurance or Social Security benefits) to individuals and families facing hardship.

>Benefits for veterans and federal retirees: In 2022, about 7 percent of the budget provides benefits to veterans and former career employees of the federal government, both civilian and military, totaling $420 billion.

>Interest on debt: 7%

Yet Canada and most of Western Europe have well functioning universal healthcare systems.
"I wouldn’t say well functioning, I know a few Canadians who come to the United States for healthcare, one European girl on her student visa came for her procedure more than her studies. And more Americans who go to Mexico for dental work."
"Canada’s system will pay for out of country procedures if timeliness is an issue.  You say you
know Canadians who came to US but did you ever ask them if they had to pay anything?  

The wait times can be an issue in Canada but if its an emergency and they cant get you in, the government will pay to have the procedures done elsewhere."
So the healthcare system in Canada is so messed up they have to rely on a different country.
"Completely not like us where people need to go there to get cheaper medicine or Mexico. 

Again, you’re purposefully being obtuse about *not having to pay* and it being for *emergency* procedures where time is critical. Do you think there is any insurance in the US that will fly someone to another country, pay for their hotel and pay for the entire cost of something?  These are rare circumstances but it shows how much better their system is compared to ours but you know that already and are just purposefully being a troll."
"Honestly I don’t want to pay for that option, I’d rather have private healthcare and insurance. Government involvement creates a scenario where they have to rely on other countries because of their failing system"

"We need gun ownership reform, not bans. Someone that shouldn't own an assault rifle, shouldn't own any firearm."
This law is great until you realize that 80% of murderers with a firearm use a handgun. . .
"I'm left of liberal and glad this will be overturned. We can't let the cops, crazies, and terrorists be the only ones who are armed. They literally want us dead. Arm your friends."
"This more than infringes on 2A, this won’t last long. Lawsuits will come and SCOTUS will destroy this. People need to understand that 2A was never put in for hunting deer and what not. They literally wanted the government to be scared of its citizens to never go off the rails and remove the other constitutional rights. They want the citizens to have the power to use force and throw out a government that does not work and defend the constitutional republic.

As it is citizens already are unable to HAVE assault weapons unless grandfathered in from long ago. It was never really contested. The AR15 is not an assault weapon and people saying AR means assault weapon just makes themselves look stupid, uneducated. You can hate firearms, that’s your right…but they take paths to protect and defend the constitution which includes 2A, the only right that says “shall not be infringed”. Those infringing are violating oaths which can be considered treason.

On the upside, this means loads of criminals with illegal weapons will now voluntarily turn in their assault weapons I suppose. Bless their hearts."
What are they defining as an “assault weapon” since that doesn’t actually exist in firearm literature. I can’t keep my semi automatic AR-15 that has the same fire rate as other hunting rifles? Like where exactly are they drawing this arbitrary line
Here's hoping it goes nationwide. If anyone wants to handle these weapons they can join the military

So far to the left its now the right wing?  Asking for a friend

gun crimes have only risen as more guns become available and there is ample evidence to show that banning assault weapons have been an effective tool in combating gun deaths

"Well said. I’m also left leaning and support the right to defend yourself. Responsible gun ownership is the way. IL native from Chicago; the vast majority of gun violence is gang related and using illegal weapons, so this ban won’t do much except hurt law abiding citizens."
More guns = more gun deaths. Proven by all statistics. We just had a 6 year old shoot his teacher in my state.
"So we’re just going to ignore the whole first half of the thing?

Let’s pretend the whole “well regulated militia” part wasn’t there (which is already what you’re doing anyway). Can you at least recognize that the framers never envisioned that the US would grow to having the worlds most powerful military, with weapons capable of wiping out tens of thousands in seconds?

They wanted the government to be scared of its citizens? Let’s say that’s true…how’s that going? Is the government scared? To say nothing of taking up arms against the government is treason, and you’d look like a fucking idiot.

Even if you’re right about your interpretation of 2A (and I don’t think you are), it’s a wildly outdated thing that no longer represents a worldview compatible with modern society. 

It would be helpful, honestly, if gun enthusiasts just admitted that they like guns. They enjoy them, they fetishize them, they like the feeling guns give them…that would at least be honest. Because holding to the “government should be scared of its citizens” line is laughably foolish to anyone with functioning eyes."
"It's scary-looking. That's the line. Drop it in a traditional wood stock, and it's not scary, so it's legal."
"No mass shooting are done by handguns more often.

https://www.statista.com/statistics/476409/mass-shootings-in-the-us-by-weapon-types-used/

This bill gives handguns 5 extra bullets in a magazine than rifles. It's a dumb bill. I don't much care for guns, but  if there is going to be strict legislation on them, it should reflect real-world issues. Handguns are far easier to conceal and will hold more bullets than a rifle."
You're right. Looks like we should have a ban on handguns too.
"That's what I'm saying. A lot of these politicians use our ideology to take advantage of our vote only to put in some phony bologna legislation and get paid. It happens on both sides, and it makes me so god damn angry.

 I'm rooting for Republicans in the house right now, though. If they can give us easy taxes every year, then they did at least one thing right."
"You're ignoring the Tax Reform was intended primarly to benefit the already too rich, with a few crumbs (like the standard deduction) to placate the working classes. There were even specific provisions that benefited only resort and golf course owners, such as being able to depreciate 100% of the value of their property rather than the previous 50% (it should be 5% over 20 years). In fact, every Republican President since and including Reagan (who cut the rich's taxes IN HALF) have issued tax cuts for the elite. Only Democrats (primarily Obama) issued tax cuts for the middle class because those are the ONLY tax cuts that actually stimulate the economy. 
{you can stop reading if desired}
The multiplier effect of money: Why ONLY middle-class tax cuts help the nation! When an average citizen receives additional money, he spends it. Which increases the incomes of the retailer, shipper, manufacturer, wholesaler, etc. Which they spend, increasing the incomes of retailers, shippers, etc. Thus 'raising all boats' and increasing the GDP. Giving primarily to the rich as Republicans do just adds zeros to tax-free foreign accounts with no resulting benefits to the nation.

"This all seems a little bit too convenient that this is happening now.

"Also, Trump refused to return the documents and looks like he was attempting to not return them. Biden looks like a case of just mismanagement, but returned them immediately once found. It’s a bit different scenario."

"90% of documents being briefed to the president are going to be classified. Then the president is going to be traveling for 350 of 365 days a year to one of 60 different offices. 
I guarantee every past president accidentally misplaced classified documents… it’s all about how they respond when they find them or are asked to look for them. Report it and cooperate."
Biden should resign. No excuse for treating these documents like this. Needs to go.
"Not only that, Biden's the one that volunteered the discovery and not trying to deny or hide it like Trump. Having said that, let's see how the independent DOJ investigation lead by a Trump appointee plays out. But like Patreus they will have to prove intent."
"Biden has been in office for over 50 years, he should know better. He’s cooperating because he has no choice at this point. 

Cooperation may cast doubt on a conspiracy charge, but gross negligence that endangered the country? Yes. That’s easily immediate resignation territory."
It's also funny that Trump was hounded for lying about and refusing official orders to return the documents in question and it sounds like this latest batch was found locked in an old office Biden used when he was VP. Biden wasn't necessarily hiding them there and they were secured in an office that sounds like it is still being used by the government
These documents are from when he was VP. How many agents of other countries had access to these? Imagine what we don’t know. These sensitive and highly classified top secret documents were unsecured for over a decade!
"Actually, there was a time when the dems were the bad guys, or at least had a very strong MAGA contingent, Dixiecrats. And don't forget. reps are the party of Lincoln. They sure as hell aren't now but there was a time.......

But yeah, in my lifetime they have done everything they could to stay in power. From breaking and entering to starting wars and bribing our enemies to hold American hostages and now a literal attempted coup."
Every other news network now doing the reverse for Biden. Is this lost on you?
I think the issue was in one case there was a refusal to return the documents. In the other they are working to track down and return everything. Whatever the case may be it is frightening that so much classified info is mishandled. The tracking systems aren’t working.
">It’s all a nothing burger, on both sides. 

It's not a nothing burger on both sides. We have a former president who intentionally kept and hid, allied nuclear secrets and human intelligence. 
Kept at his properties, where Sauids held 4 golf tournaments last year. The same Saudis who paid Kushner $2billion after they left office, and another 1billion to Steve mnuchin. The same Saudis who fucking bonesawed a journalist, and the Trump team helped cover it up. 

Anybody who ""both sides"" this is fucking delusional. It may not affect your day to day life. But it sure as fuck affects national security."
That’s the most GQP type of response I’ve seen.
"Yep, I see a mad scramble to define the narrative."
"Thats being done because Biden did nothing illegal and the government needs impartial proof that there was nothing illegal.  This isn't partisan.  cinnamon hitler likely broke the law and it's being investigated.  President Joe Biden likely didn't break any laws (just like Hillary) and it's being investigated.

"And/or name a special counsel for impartial investigating:  
https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/01/12/us/biden-classified-documents"
Why would he resign?   The non partisan investigation will show Biden didn’t know anything about the documents.  They were all handled and maintained by staff with clearance without this knowledge.  He’s not dumb like orange hitler.  Just wait.
I don't see Garland taking an opinion one way or another; at least not one he would state openly.
Prove it.
He should know better?
Meaning they were in that office the whole time Trump was president. Maybe his staff put them there?
They just found more in a garage…
"There's a procedure to follow when declassifying documents which tRump did not follow. His declaring in his feeble brain that a document is declassified does not make it so. Remember, the president is the head of the executive branch and not a king. As the head of the executive branch, a president has to communicate to the people who work for him any change in polices via directives."
"The bigots migrated to the republican party in the mid 1960s. The ""party of Lincoln"" died right there."

He should be the foremost expert, he’s one of the longest running politicians in American history and he services two terms as Vice president and is the current president. Rules around classified documents are Executive orders from the executive office. 

As of this post, more documents were just found in his Delaware residence. The highest classified document found this far as TS/SCI…"
And they were turned over to the FBI.  The FBI raided the Biden house and it barely was noticed.  Weird how liberals react compared to nutters and cultists.
"Sure yes, Trump is bad and did wrong. But he’s not president anymore. Plus he’s dumb right? 

Biden though, super smart, handsome, cool, the good guy. How could he possibly make this mistake with over 50 years on the job? Trump, just a failed business man.

Trump is already gone, but Biden is currently the President… he and his cabinet should resign immediately. This is something we can all agree on. Criminal charges? That can be dealt with later, but first step is to resign."
I thought this place was “liberal” not “democrat”. But it seems like you’re right.
Which one refused to hand over documents even when subpoenad? Thought so.
Presidents like tangerine tyrant and Joe Biden are embarrassing.  There will be no resignation and I predict Biden will actually lean into it when the investigation finds no wrong doing.  In the end the average voter doesn’t care about classified documents. It’s a nothing burger.
"Actually, with the Air Force and Coast Guard I had Confidential, Secret and Top Secret.  You?"
"He took them when he was Vice President I believe, didn’t realize they were still there. Gave them back immediately. Is it wrong to keep them yes and his unknowing doesn’t make it better. But he did the right thing when he found out. As for these new ones idk much about ut"
"I don’t recall any mention of the classification level.

But I’m not sure that is relevant anyway"
"You have neither the power or the ability to hurt me.

Don't flatter yourself."
How many Russian agents you think may have had access to those documents over the last decade? How much do we not know about? What was taken that will never be accounted for?
"We're all human and we all make mistakes. There's no need for any resignations over a mistake. In tRump's case, we're dealing with obstruction. He refused to voluntarily return the documents requested, declaring them his personal property. There would not be any charges pending against tRump if he had simply complied with the request from the national archives but he resisted and obstructed for well over a year. That is the difference between the two cases."
You can’t imagine the rage I felt when Trump took those docs. Biden went on TV and was indignant about how Trump couldn’t know he possessed them. I agreed with Biden. Still do. He’s humiliating.
"I’m not doing to doubt you because obviously we’ve seen people with clearances make negligent mistakes. (Biden) But people with clearances usually don’t advertise they have/had one and if they do for a specific relevant reason, they only mention the highest one. 

With that, you should know how serious mishandling classified material is and through training should know that ignorance or neglect is not a defense."
Cool story bro.  Doesn't apply to Bidumb.
"The most important thing is that we don’t have a two tier justice system. Biden set a good example by reporting to the DOJ (despite hiding it until long after the midterms, which may be another issue…) but he can continue to set the better example by resigning. Only Trump would have held out and never resigned over something like this if he was still in office."
We don’t know the number but CNN last said “some top secret” in a comparison chart.
Go away Antifa
"Right and I’m not saying charge Biden with obstruction or conspiracy. But he should be charged with mishandling classified documents and negligence. These were top secret documents and with Biden having over 50 years of experience…

Not being political but he should resign at the very least."
Yeah he’s no President Barack Hussein Obama.  That’s for sure.  I really love how much he pisses off nutters just by talking.  That makes me happy.
"You asked if I knew how classification works.

I told you I did and why."
Prove it.
I don’t think Biden will resign over this considering he didn’t realize he still had them and the archives weren’t actually searching for them. So both parties didn’t realize they were missing
"Ok, thanks I’ll check it out."
"I rest my case.

Dismissed."
How do you know they were too secret?
"How do you know President Joe Biden mishandled them?  What if it was an envoy or a representative for President Barrack Hussein Obama who shared and stored the intelligence for important, remote meetings and never retrieved them.  It could be anything.  The independent counsel will sort it out."
Fair. I probably should have asked if you cared about how classification works when it applies to your preferred political candidate instead.
"That’s a safeguarding problem then. Still a crime. These are documents related to national security, you can’t just “oops” it. There are logs regarding these things. There needs to be a significant look into safeguarding procedures and if a President can’t safeguard top secret documents then he may not be fit for the job. I think that’s fair and I’d argue that Trump should be held to the same standard."
There’s a few articles that have said “some top secret”. CNN was last article I saw mentioning it.
"That's a loaded question that I will not answer.

I have no idea what Biden was privy to, nor is it my business."
"I definitely feel like trump should be held to the same standard, if seen that through Biden’s negligence nothing happened then I doubt anything happens but need some actual investigations into trump too"
"I think we’re on the same page for this. DOJ needs to raid all Biden residences immediately as well as a resignation from Biden. Then DOJ can conduct investigations on Trump and Biden. Hell, they can even share a cell at the end. But we definitely need equal application of the law. I remember Democrats saying that someone who can’t handle classified documents is not fit for office and I think I agree."
Biden's resignation would make Kamala Harris president.  I doubt that's really what many conservatives actually want happening.
"She should resign with him, it’s the only honorable thing to do. I’m not particularly happy about McCarthy being next in line either. But it seems to dangerous to leave things as they are."
"What exactly makes her resignation justified or honorable?  

She is not complicit in anything Biden did as VP.  There's literally nothing to dishonor her reputation in the least bit and she would definitely see accepting the role as president as the honorable thing to do in the highly unlikely event that Biden were to resign.  

Honestly, no matter how hard they try, the house probably won't even get enough votes for an impeachment over this.

What ""danger"" do you envision if things are left as they are?"
I’m gonna take a shortcut. Transpose everything democrats said about Trump’s classified documents and apply that. Save us all the mental gymnastics.
"Nope. You're making a strawman argument. The two situations are completely different. 

Trump lied and attempted to hide the documents, would not return them when requested and many documents are missing.  

Biden discovered he had documents that he forgot about and immediately did the right thing by disclosing and turning them in with full cooperation.  

Biden's actions are a perfect example of what the right and honorable thing to do in the situation and Trump's actions are a perfect example of what the wrong and dishonorable thing to do in the situation.

Also... so far what charges have been brought against Trump for his theft of classified documents? Why hasn't he faced any consequences yet?  

It's not about what people from one political persuasions opinions say about it that matters, it's the actual real world consequences brought down by the justice department that matters and also sets the precedent.  So far, there's nothing but crickets."
"You’re talking about obstruction. I’m talking about mishandling of classified material which is the more dangerous crime. Yes Trump may have lied, but Biden potentially hid it for years and the walls were closing in. 

If they both share a cell, then fine. But mishandling classified material is extremely serious and Biden is guilty."
"Really?  Trump kept his stolen documents in a pool house shed at Mar-A-Lago.  You really gonna say that that's not mishandling?

Furthermore... Obstruction often comes along with a string of other offences since it's behavior that guilty people engage in to attempt to cover up their crimes."
"I’m not defending trump at all, that was also mishandling. Heck, Trump and Biden can both share a cell. 

I agree with Nancy Pelosi when she said that anyone mishandling classified documents like that is unfit for public service."
"The problem is the paucity of local investigative journalism. With so much local news having been killed by the internet, it’s very hard to find out anything about local politicians. We have fantastic information on governors, senators and Presidents, but anything below that generally slips under the radar.

But remember that Santos is a practiced con man. He played a part in his own election by crafting lies that benefited his campaign and that seemed plausible so that observers did not check."
"70/30.

I live in his district and his opponent Zimmerman claimed that he had some of this information and went to the papers, but papers were covering other more exciting candidates locally and nationally.  Since Zimmerman had a very slim budget and little support from the Nassau Democratic Committee.  

But honestly Santos' district and most of Long Island NY has gone full MAGA.  I own 2 family house with my brother and I am trying to convince him to sell and move back to NYC.  The problem is while he is not full MAGA he doesn't mind them and is a Republican himself."
"There are many people, maybe not the ones with an overriding concern, that knew Santos was a liar. The problem is not with Democrats' failure to investigate whether he was a typical republican, but rather with the broad cynicism which seems to be spreading across America, in no small part encouraged by conservative losers. Thankfully, the state GOP organization has recognized how Santos has embarrassed them, and so has called for his resignation. But it is unlikely that national GOP will have such concerns over yet another con man in their camp."
Santos is walking proof that republicans are the most gullible and useful idiots in the world.
"I also have a bone deep contempt for Republicans, but they are adults with moral agency. They knew what Santos was and they liked it.

Daddy doesn’t drink because Mommy burned the casserole or you got a C in algebra. He drinks because he loves booze."
Why tf should Democrats have ANY blame in this? Republicans need to investigate their own candidates and are responsible for their own.
"I can't fault Republicans for voting for him when they didn't know about his lies. But at the same time they knew all about Trump but voted for him anyway, so it's not like their ignorance about Santos means that they wouldn't knowingly vote for a liar."
"All on Republicans. They’ve proven they don’t care about things like this. They don’t even care about insurrection. 

But, I wouldn’t be surprised if GOP voters simply didn’t know because they live in their conservative media bubble."
Santos is proof that Republicans have no integrity.
"Even if the Democrats went all out in investigating the guy and trying to tell the voters not to vote for him, if the voters wanted him, they still would have voted him into office. The Republicans would elect a dead skunk in the middle of the road as long as it was on the ballot as a Republican. They don’t care."
I don't believe it would have made one whit of difference and he would have still been elected. Criminality or taints of it have not stopped people being elected (Gym Jordan comes to mind)
"Republicans don't care. As long as there's an ""R"" by his name, they're going to vote for him."
Democrats are not to blame for the shitty behavior of Republicans.
"Honest to God, I had a Republican shrug and say ""is it against the law to lie? As long as it's not about the financial stuff?""
We are never going to live out how low they can go.  I mean.........seriously, do we have to make a law (ahem! one of their Ten Commandments) against lying???  No such thing as morals and ethics and decent behavior and truth any longer?"
"Isn't ""lying Republican"" redundant?"
All of the above
I don't see how it's the Dems responsibility at all. But that's just me.
We can unequivocally blame Nassau County GOP because [they had a resume](https://politicalwire.com/2023/01/11/the-secret-resume-of-george-santos/) but they failed to verify anything on it.
"Wait a minute, how is it the Dems responsibility to vet a Repub candidate? Shouldn't that be their responsibility and their task since his faked past makes them look shady AF? And personally, the ship has already sailed on them being able to react properly. Their initial reaction was to accept him, so let them get stuck with his racist hand signaling fake ass."
"Excellent question. His opponent’s campaign people are clearly utterly incompetent. Guaranteed that several people‘s sole job was to dig up dirt on Santos. Easiest job in the world it turns out.

On the other hand, Santos is more than a mere liar. Dude seriously sounds like a sociopath. No way that didn’t manifest itself during his campaign, which puts into question his entire staff as well. 

I’m starting to wonder whether he was such a complete sociopath that people were frightened of him, including his staff and his opponents. Because WTF?"
"This guy ran in 2020 as well, this is basic oppo research that the democrats failed to do."
It can be both.
Does DJT ring a bell?
"Any information turned up solely by Democrats would just be disregarded by too many voters in the district. This level of scrutiny needs to be done by local journalists but they have largely been denuded of resources. The fact that Santos could 'get away' with this much lying and still be elected is a sign of how information ebbs and flows in the modern world.  
...and now that we know that Santos used deception to summon the 'consent of the governed', what does the House intend to do about it?"
"Our newspaper was bought out by media giant Gannett before the internet had it's big impact. That might not have been it's death, but it was the beginning of the end. The internet was the coup de grâce."
It could also be those who want to embarrass the gop wanted till after he won so they could point and laugh
I think they knew he was a shit but not that he lied about his entire life.
"> They knew what Santos was and they liked it.

Most voters had no idea about his extensive lies because how could they have possibly known when nobody was talking about it? Even the local Republicans didn't know how extensive his lies were because now they're calling for him to resign."
"Have you ever heard of the Republicans being responsible for a bad Democrat? Absolutely not, a bad Democrat would be 100% the responsibility of the Democrats, so why would you blame Santos on the Dems?"
"NPR discussed this the other day. They said it's party laziness.  Both parties are expected to find dirt on the oppositions candidate, so they don't bother investigating their own.  In this case, the Democrats thought it was enough to point out that Santos was anti abortion and pro Trump so they stopped looking."
Because it shows we don't do a good enough job informing voters about the alternative and contrasting it with our candidates.  We have a LOT to learn from this.
">I can't fault Republicans for voting for him when they didn't know about his lies.

Can you fault them for voting for a guy they knew nothing about? That they elected him makes them kind of responsible for him. The fucking republican voters in his district own this embarrassment."
"This only matters if they care about whether what they believe or tell others is true or not. Given that they voted for Trump knowing that he is dishonest demonstrates that for them, they see it as a feature i.e. something that can be used to “own the libs”. They only care when it becomes something that either a) their one true sin, losing or b) they feel deceived in a manner that is important to them directly."
"Even if they did know, it would not change their view nor their vote."
Of course they don’t care. That’s why it was absurd seeing the Nassau Country Republicans demanding Santos resign this afternoon.
Agreed. Basic opposition research should have uncovered the lies.
Riiiight. The Democrats should have exploited his lying but they cannot be the ones to present that data without being discarded as partisan hack jobs by too many. These facts need to be discovered by local journalists and then elevated to voters.
I’m really curious to know what lies they knew about. What was acceptable to them before he was exposed and became an embarrassment?
"Yeah, if Santos was a Democrat no-one would be asking “did the Republicans do zero research?” They’d again ask “Did Democrats do zero research?”"
That only works for undecided voters. A republican will vote for anybody with an R by their name on the ballot.
"What do you mean they knew nothing about him?  He had been interviewed, written about, spent months bragging about himself.  This guy probably only won in a competitive district because people listened to all his bullshit about being a gay, Jewish, animal lover philanthropist, Wall Street investment banker.  He literally lied so that just about every fucking idiot that is caught up in identity politics would find him appealing. 

If the Democrats or the media were even partly competent, this would not have happened.  There is reporting that the Republican Party knew he was lying before the election, but let it slide because he was already the only candidate they had.  

You want to blame someone, blame one of the institutions that we rely on for a healthy democracy which has failed us."
That’s the issue grass roots level journalism is dead. In any case I think we shouldn’t have lost so many seats in NY.

Both claims are misleading.""

Huh, Cons are lying sacks of shit.... Who knew..."
I feel like the IRS should be self funding. The more money they find not paid the more funding they get.   Start with the richest people and work your way down.

"Do Republicans really think the IRS needs more agents to audit more low-income tax returns? One person can sit behind a desk and process thousands of these audits.

They never learn to use any critical thinking skills. So when Fox News tells them some garbage, they believe every bit of it."

The measure was to hire 87,000 IRS employees. Not all employees have the authority to audit or become agents.

>*The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which analyzes bills for lawmakers, reported in an analysis on Monday that the GOP's IRS measure, known as the Family and Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act, from Rep. Adrian Smith, R-Neb., would raise the deficit by $114 billion.*

Being afraid of change will not stop it from happening.

Change is needed so that the billionaires like one term twice impeached former President Trump and his cronies pay taxes.

Do you think it's OK for him to pay ""$ 0"" in taxes?

I don't.

That needs to change.

The IRS was short staffed and they did not have enough people assigned / going over his taxes? What?

Even though it is mandated by the IRS that all presidential taxes be audited and made available. As a matter of fact? You could go online today and find tax returns of former presidents.

Just Google it.

In actuality? I can't wait for the IRS Commissioner (that did the dirty work) for one term twice impeached former President Trump to come before Congress. 

Oh? Least we forget? 

That might not happen because the Republicans are doing away with so many processes in place to stop autocratic progression in America.

And? They are trying to protect their fearless leader, as usual.

There's always hope. I have high hopes."
Good. Anyone supporting the IRS funding is either not paying attention or stupid and worshiping an ideology.
Please please tell me you aren’t disagreeing with this great legislation (that will help poor and middle class citizens) just because the Republicans are trying to pass it? Please tell me we liberals aren’t that dumb
"This isn't becoming law, it's just the GOP showing how shitty they want to make the country."
It still is… the House can’t undo this by themselves. They need the Senate and White House to agree - which they are not doing so at the moment.
"It still will, considering the GOP bill to block it has about the same chance to pass as I have to become the supreme emperor of the universe before bedtime tonight."
"It's funded by taxes right. So, it's self funding as much as any government agency is. The only reason to do this is to help tax cheats, that's it.

If it was fully funded, we would possibly have more money, and less waiting on refunds."

That's a lot of money for Republicans who __*claim* they want to save Americans money.__

Republicans tried fear mongering to try to send fear into the homes of Americans, even to the point of claiming that all of the new hires would be armed. And that they would go after lower and middle class Americans.

It's __one of their infamous tactics.__

>*Republicans claimed throughout the midterm campaign that Democrats were sending ""an army of IRS agents"" to go after middle- and lower-class taxpayers with the new agency funding in the IRA, which passed along party lines last year. Some Republicans even went so far as to suggest that the IRS agents would be armed.*

The manipulative fearmongering of the grifter known as one term twice impeached former President Trump, and his minions are something Americans don't want.

They __made it clear__ in the last election.

In actuality? 87,000 employees of the IRS are slated to be hired. Not all of them have the ability to audit, nor will all of them be agents. 

Many employees of the IRS are slated to leave due to retirement, changing jobs, etc. The new personnel and other changes will take place __over a 10-year span.__

Republicans __do not want__ IRS employees to be hired. Nor do they want the IRS, its facilities, and IT systems to be updated - something they have desperately needed for a long time. 

The Republicans make it seem like the employees __would be hired today,__ which is not true. The changes take place over the *span of a decade.*

They have continuously fought funding to provide personnel, facility, and technological upgrades to the IRS to __protect their friends, lobbyists, and corporate supporters.__

>*The IRS has said it plans over the next decade to use the roughly $80 billion from the IRA to update its antiquated technology systems, after years of under-funding by Congress, and hire and train new information technology specialists and customer service representatives as well as new agents, only a small fraction of whom -- in the Criminal Investigation division -- are armed.* 

Some of those people will have jobs to assist with auditing people like one term twice impeached former President Trump and his cronies. 

It's __very much needed.__

Obviously? 

Any *billionaire* __who pays 0 in taxes?__ Or even $750 during another year? And has many friends and cronies who do the __exact same thing?__

Needs to be audited.

And their red headed leader is not the only one.

While __my family and others__ pay so much more? 

Period.

We need the money. And they need to pay their share.

That is all we are asking for. 

We __want them to pay their fair share.__

What is wrong with that?

It is a disgrace and an embarrassment.

>*The right to a House delegate comes from a treaty signed in December 1835 between the federal government and Cherokee members that led to the brutally forced removal of the tribe from its ancestral home to land in what is now Oklahoma. That route became known as the Trail of Tears.*

I believe President Biden and his administration will be the leaders in the advancement of the promises to be kept to our Cherokee brothers and sisters.

>*Since then, the historical Cherokee tribe has divided into three groups: the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, and the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians.*

And?

It's about time."

Didn’t think I’d ever get the chance to say this but really proud of China for putting a damper on emissions! Hopefully this is a trendsetting moment.
"2 years, actually. The stop took place in December 2020."
Our justice system is grossly underfunded. Our entire infrastructure has been slowly dismantled since the GOP with Reagan declare the government to be the enemy and along with trickle down economics (piss on the middle class actually) fanned the flames to tax cut fanaticism.
"Wouldn't be surprised if these pics get off scort-free, too.

Since when is it acceptable to tell a US Army officer ""You're fixing to ride the lightning **SON**"" (emphasis added), when he's not breaking any laws and is actively serving in uniform.

These officers were clearly racist pigs.  Glad one of them got fired over this- but given how police officers who get fired just end up employed at other departments and purge their records most of the time, this is not nearly enough..."
Thats still 23 months longer than it should take to put those cops behind bars for just assaulting this man for no reason
"A lot of people think Reagan was a great President. Years from now, historians will look at all the crappy things he did and tell the truth. He sucked. He's the scumbag bastard that laid the foundation for Rush Limbaugh; Fox News; repeal of the Glass Steagall Act; repeal of the the Fairness Doctrine and more. BTW, if Jimmy Carter had any balls, Reagan would have been arrested for treason due to his deal he made with Ayatollah Khomeini."
Your take is basically how (most) academics understand Reagan.
Why do you think Presidential historians have Reagan ranked highly? Do you think their political preferences come into play? I'm also trying to figure out why Trump isn't rated dead last.
"Trump isn’t dead last because of George W Bush. The rehabilitation of his catastrophic legacy - even by some progressives - is a fucking joke. 

Until Democrats can actually kill these sacred cows of the right in the public mind we’re going to be continually gored by them."
"I'm afraid those are questions I don't know anything about.

Economists generally like Reagan because he made everything cheaper for businesses (and, hence, wealthy people).  But I don't know how that applies to Presidential historians.

Social scientists and humanities scholars consider Reagan to be awful because of his assaults on social services and the working and middle classes.

And, I have no idea why Trump wouldn't be last.  Maybe there were more incompetent presidents in the past?  (I don't know).  Or maybe because Trump actually motivated a huge base?"

Not impressed...' It's not in the Constitution' is a BS argument.. the forefathers couldn't and didn't know what particular issues would emerge in time... The 2nd amendment has been bastardized by ignoring the 'well regulated militia's verbage...  And this text IS in the Constitution
Republiculters like twisting words in the Constitution to fit their warped views the same way they grossly misinterpret the Bible.
I’ll believe it when I see it. I got no hope that a conservative actually wants this. They are traditionalists through and through and want a theocracy.
"Interesting article that quickly moves on from the discussion of S.B. 8 and it's impact, and spends more time on the larger question of the Court's supremacy in Constitutional law. That raises some interesting questions, but it does feel a bit too designed to bring liberals into alignment with people who have actively worked to destroy accepted legal protections. Seems like the article is creating a candy-coated poison pill, imo."
"He gets what he wants and then works to defang the court.  that tracks on modern conservative, ""activist judges for me but for thee"""
"Liberals do NOT want to disempower THE judiciary, just the ones on the top court."
"The article basically says “No really liberals just go along with this super conservative anti abortion constitution fundamentalist to make it so nothing that wasnt imagined hundreds of years ago can ever be law, it will definitely help your cause in the 21st century we super duper pinky promise and we totally wont throw you under the bus the second that pandoras box is opened”… Yea suck a dick bro. Anybody who falls for this in this day and time and climate is a moron. Which either OP is a trojan horse conservative posting here (as usual) or a moron, either way he can screw with this crap."

Fucking exactly. Conservatives rewrote the 2nd with Heller in 2008. You can “read” the stupid thing however the fuck you want and if you’re in power that’s the law.
Exactly what I got from it. No really go along with this super conservative anti abortion crusader and it will help you guys out too I super pinky promise…
"IMHO Democrat Michael Dukakis was a weak candidate and Lee Atwater, who ran Bush's campaign, was a shameless, amoral scumbag who would stop at nothing to win. A lot of people point at Newt Gingrich and the 1994 Congress as the beginning of the GOP becoming untethered from reality, but IMO Atwater's work shows that it goes back further than that.

In an interview in 1991, growing reflective after a nasty fight with brain cancer, Atwater apologized to Dukakis for the ""naked cruelty"" of the campaign against him in 1988."
"Apart from the Willie Horton and the tank photo op, Reagan was popular with the middle class. The economy was good. People wanted more of that. Bush was seen as a continuation of the Reagan years. I mean, he ran up the debt like crazy, but when you're running up a credit card you feel like you're rich. The results of that debt weren't really felt until Bush's presidency."
Willie Horton
"Dukakis put on a helmet and rode in a tank, looked ridiculous, we can't have that."
"Dukakis was not a good campaigner. He had to deal with the Willie Horton issue and the debate where they asked about if he want the death penalty for someone if they murdered his wife, the tank pictures etc…"
"Republicans are amoral scumbags who would skin their children alive to win an election.

Dukakis also didnt do much campaigning"
"Yes, 1988 was the beginning of the insane campaign seasons that characterize Republican campaign tactics, that really never ended. 1976, 1980 and 1984 were quite civil in comparison. (that's as far back as my living political memory goes)"
Michael Dukakis was done dirty by the Bush campaign. I voted for Dukakis because I knew it was a smear job.
seems like Atwater got Karma'd hard for once
A hugely racist smear job at that.
ONE Republican came to pay respect to the police officers that died. I don’t EVER wanna see another GOP Congressperson or Senator ever talk about how they support the police. Especially when they are screaming about defunding the FBI.
"People just don't seem to realize how dangerous this moment in history was. Had the insurrection been a little bit bigger and more organized, we could have ended up with a whole bunch of dead congresspeople and their staffers. It was an attack on Democracy itself, and it was orchestrated by Donald Dump and the Republican party."
"In an interview with CNN late last year, Kaptur recalled approaching a ""very high-ranking member of the House"" and warning that the federal government needed to invest in the middle of the country. ""We are going to have political unrest. I even used a stronger word. I said even perhaps fascism,"" she said.

That was before the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol."
"Unfortunately, far too many Democrats naïvely believed they could ""listen to,"" ""build consensus with,"" ""reach out to,""  ""negotiate with"" and of course ""be bipartisan with"" fascists, criminals and terrorists.

They were laughing all the time."
I have been hoping this is the birth of a third party.  The ultra right wing to split the GOP and force them both into powerlessness.
I call (202) 225-2915 every day. When they answer “Kevin McCarthy’s office” I say “Kevin McCarthy? I was looking for the speaker of the house!”
I'd bet money these psychos are going to force a default on the national debt
"Wait till Trump runs as an Independent, then watch the split."
We always knew exactly what they were.
My biggest wish is for the Repubiclan Party to self-destruct and no longer exist.
"We’re going to find out really quick. If they get these shitty fucking rules passed tonight, we’re in for a LOOOONG 2 years. If a few republicans somehow grow a spine, we might be okay.

Edit: looks like they decided to wait until Monday for the rules vote."
If the Republican really wants to fix it’s self all the normal Republicans should join Democrats until the nuts are gone
Have they announced the Biden Impeachment yet?
When Trump runs as 3rd party that’s when this shit show really ramps up.  I can’t wait.
May it purify and fade into the flora
The proof lies in the foxnews.com comment section. Go check it out. I guarantee you will find it full of nothing but hatred and bigotry.
"Clearly...No respect at all for the fundamental principles of democracy. As long as they can keep the flow of dollars out of the Treasury and into their donors accounts, they think ""Job Well Done!"" $30 trillion over the last 41 years. IOW, $50/week from EVERY AMERICAN alive since 1981. An average of $106K.  
The immiseration of the middle class begins with all the deficit spending.

"Hopefully, no one does save it. Both parties need to crumble to the ground to save this nation."
Ok
Yet they still aren't fascists despite some people believing that lol
Well at least they can now refill the bag with not shit unlike the democrats who are just another bag of shit just intact
No lies detected
I do think it’s happening.
I've been hoping for this since Trump and DeSantis started to distance themselves from each other.
"If Trump runs as a third party, that's when it'll happen."
It's kind of informally occurred
In a first past the post winner take all system it cant happen. There can be a transition period where a new party forms and if they win the members of the old party will then migrate over to the new party as what happened with the republican party 150ish years ago. The best we can hope for is a new right leaning party forms that wants to govern and isnt filled with crazies but regular ppl who are sick of the republican bs and they gain more support than the republican party so they fight it out for a few election cycles where the republican party keeps losing and then the moderate conservative party wins out and becomes the second party that runs against the democrats. If we want a multi party system we need to change the system to be a parliamentary republic.
You don't think it's damaging to not have a single functional right wing party in this country?
"As long as the Perot the Rs, that’s cool."
"Alas, that's not an appropriate response anymore. Now all we can do is just hope for the best in 2024."
Bet? It's part of their party platform.
What's that mean?
They have said that from day one.
The Dems could run anyone and win. I’m hoping for a Pete/Porter ticket.
"God, I hope. That’s the only shot of Democrats holding the Senate and would guarantee a Democrat wins the Presidency.

I doubt Trump will though. As spiteful as he is, even he knows he’d do terribly just due to being a third party candidate. He wont want to suffer that embarrassment."
The democrats would be the new right lol. Then maybe we could have a real progressive party.
"Lol.
Optimistic aren't you."
"I wonder why progress looks so much like destruction. 
  - John Steinbeck"
"Yes, excuse us. We meant to say deplorable racist fascist. They claim themselves to be Domestic Terrorists. Didn’t you see the CPAC this year? The stage was also in the shape of a swastika just in case some of them weren’t paying full attention."
Weren't they all complaining that they couldn't just force a Speaker into position?
DrAiN tHe SwAmP
"They tried that. The far right just put rancid, runny shit in the bag."
I like your optimism.
We can only hope
"Stop, I can only get so erect."
Trump isn't going anywhere. AG Jack Smith is in DC putting together his dream team. Trump indictments are no longer a matter of IF anymore.
There is no value in the right wing.
“Now I’m going with “why isn’t everything fixed”
"If the debt ceiling isn't raised, the US will default on its national debt, causing an economic crisis.  Only Congress can raise the debt ceiling."
Google debt ceiling
Pete for sure
Perfect!
None of that has anything to do with fascism. Republican party does not want to install a dictator so that we don't have democracy any more.
I want you to be right. But it's always going to be an IF until it happens.
"The government of a nation can't move at 1000mph while half of its citizens are moving at 20, without a catastrophic split and collapse."
So you don't care if we have anything anchoring us to our traditions and history? There has to be a counterweight to the left.
Perfect
Is there anything we can do to stay beneath the ceiling?
"Wouldn't a default mean we set back to 0 having no national debt? And just screw countries we owe? I doubt they have been accouting with the debt we owe them in place. 

I think it is more of a we aren't paying anyone back statement."
I loved Pete's first run but I don't think he can win a national general election like President. That's just my perspective/feeling. His communication skills are through the roof though!
Right. They just want to run America dictatorially.
When they let our government default on our debt your 401k will be worthless. You tried though.
What the double fuck?
Lmao how the fuck do you know
"Tradition is peer pressure from dead people, so only something stupid people care about.  The only thing that is important is reality, not political views.  The left uses scientifically reviewed and tested plans and goals that make society better for everyone.  The right is always trying to make sure the rich stay rich and the poor stay poor."
"I think you make a good point about counterweight. I used to think of it like riding a bike, you have to pedal on both sides to make it balance and go forward. The balance was to keep extremists from both parties from having too much power. But look what has happened. The extremists on the right have taken over the House. They do not care about governing, about making things better for We the People; they only care about power. In essence, they want straight white “Christian” men to rule and anyone else should be here only to *serve THEM*. That is true and it has always been true. That is why they are so cruel about not wanting to help the military after they have served, or the middle class and poor, the marginalized, the peons. 
This country is in so much trouble. But then so is the Republican Party. We will see how it plays out. 
BTW I care about traditions and history. We are just knocked off our bikes right now."
"In the short term no, it allows the treasury to pay for things that have already been signed into law."
No one outside the US would want to lend to the US after that. Everyone would want the country to pay upfront for everything.
"Unrelated, this guy can’t get a credit card anymore."
Lol no.
What's the benefit of what? Raising the debt ceiling?
His comms is why I think he'll win
"A vague generalistic description of Republican party. For the most part Republicans want to lessen government, other than in certain key instances, and lessen taxes. The fact they have a sizable minority of crazy people in the party doesn't make the fascist.

Oh and it's like how one can be a white supremacists and still not a fascist. Specific words require sufficient things for something to equal them."
Science is nothing without tradition and values. Science can't hold a country together.
I agree with a lot of what you said. I'm just invested in trying to fix the Republican Party. People will start listening when they realize the current ideology is causing them to lose repeatedly.
We'll see.
You're right. They do want to lessen government in a manner of speaking.
No you were not.
"The only thing right wingers value is power and money, so yeah no thanks bro"
"What traditions and values do the right hold, that the left doesn't, that you so strongly want to continue?

I can literally see no tradition or value that is held only by the right that I want the country to continue holding on to."
It would not benefit the nation. It would absolutely wreck the economy.
"And they’ll blame the subsequent economic crash on the Democrats, specifically President Biden."
"They think it will reign in spending or so they claim. It happens all the time, because it's easy fodder for the minority party. They accuse the majority party of wreckless spending, in an attempt to get the majority party to agree to their demands.

Truth is that they should just do away with the limit, especially given how much time is wasted each time it's raised. Normally I wouldn't think much of it, but the GOP is so radical now that they might go too far this time."
"They wouldn't. In past years some have *threatened* to, in order to get concessions from the other side.  The debt ceiling was originally created to help fund World War 1.  It made it easier to borrow for the war.  It was never meant to be used as it is today."
"Maybe this helps.

https://www.crfb.org/papers/qa-everything-you-should-know-about-debt-ceiling"
"They know it would be catastrophic, so they try to cram as many additional items into the debt ceiling bill as possible and hold the country hostage until senate and president agree to their demands."
"Perhaps Biden might end up working out deals with more moderate Republicans in the house..
(""Sigh"" Wishful thinking!)"
Strategy would necessitate some form of a legislative agenda
The extremist Republicans are now in power. I doubt they will agree to anything in the way of compromises with the Democrats.
"However, control is very narrow. On top of that Democrats still have the Senate."
"Yes - I think we can expect a lot of their obstructive tactics, political investigations and impeachments of Biden. They will definitely shutdown the goverment and hold that hostage to try to get extremist concessions from the Democrats."
"We don’t know what the concessions were, but we’ll be paying for them."
I would deny committee assignments to every one of those members who voted present in the final vote.
"A ""concession"" would probably be for him to tell the MAGAts that T****  is never wrong and that he would swear absolute loyalty to T**** no matter what."
"If you thought McCarthy’s election was frustrating, please note: The concessions have reduced the Speaker’s legislative negotiating style to “let me check with Matt on that and I’ll get back to you.”"
"Regardless the MAGAs ain't goin get shit! 

The GOP control of the house is rather narrow plus Democrats still have the Senate and Presidency."
"Concessions as in:committee assignments. Also, the ability for it to take less members to start ""movement/resolution"" (I can't remember the word rn) to remove the speaker. Other concessions I haven't heard about but specifics I'm not sure."
"McCarthy wanted his name to go in the history books. No telling what his concessions are! Remember he is a Trump boy. He has sold his soul. But who knows, he really may do what’s equal and right for all Americans….right or left! Do you believe?"
"We'll find out about those concessions on Monday, when they try to get it together and vote on the House Rules.

And then we'll see more when the committee assignments are handed out."
"MTG's gonna be subpoena'ing anyone she feels like dragging into the house and interrogating.  And since only one side cares about following laws, Democrats are actually gonna drop everything, show up, and let her Benghazi for days on end."
🫠
We the people will be paying for them. Congress will be useless for the next 2 years.
"We know what they were...

https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/09/us/politics/house-rules-republicans-mccarthy.html 

""The package passed on Monday evening in a mostly party-line vote of 220-213, with just one Republican voting “no.” It includes the so-called Holman rule, which allows lawmakers to use spending bills to defund specific programs and fire federal officials or reduce their pay; makes it harder for lawmakers to raise the debt limit; and paves the way for the creation of a new select subcommittee under the Judiciary Committee focused on the “weaponization” of the federal government.""

"McCarthy doesn’t have the backbone. He’s afraid of the lunatics in his party and rightfully so. I’m curious if he’s even aware that he doesn’t have the majority he thinks he has. The goon squad can hold things up to get what they want just like Manchin and Sinema did.

Even a functioning party has a hard time reigning in their dirtbags but that’s what you do when razor thin majorities are present. You make friends across the aisle and toss out partisan nonsense otherwise you’ll get nothing done."
"The only reason he won was because of those that voted present, because it lowered the number of votes he needed. Would be crazy to then punish them for it."
And then is there a recall vote that the whole house votes on? Or just the majority party?
I think he already did that.
"It’s exhausting, isn’t it?"
They are happy to get nothing done. Any claims otherwise are just misdirection.
They were the last holdouts. They will be the biggest thorn in his side.
Whole house.
They can blame the democrats.
"Have any of them? No? Moving on, then."
"No, he’s a Republican."
How would extradition to Brazil to face theft charges work?
He's a Republican. They don't face consequences for their behavior.
"Could? Who knows 

Should? Definitely"
He should face consequences for that lipstick color.
"If politicians were punished for lying, the system would collapse.  So nothing other then maybe someone running against him in the next primary"
"He should, but won't"
Nope. Repugnicans have lied so much they've lost the truth for at least a generation.
"I love this: “…Republicans could eventually face a reality in which ""keeping him in their conference does more harm than good for their general party reputation…” ! 
Anyone who doesn’t know Republicans lie like bags of shit isn’t smart enough or concerned enough to really care. You either see what they’re doing or you’re taken in by it. And for those who say “Well, both parties lie.” Yes, but Democrats have no “alternate facts.” They aren’t trying to sprinkle sugar on a turd and telling you it’s a cookie."
That would set a precedent…nope.
"Well, he's never going to be re-elected...His ""jew-ish"" misrepresentation won't sit well with many of his constituents who really are Jewish."

Why?  None of the other liars have.
No.

He’s an international criminal. This tends to be a self solving problem.
"Actually, yes. And the reason is glorious. He was not initially uncovered by the NYT, but by a local NY paper run by a Republican who used to have the seat. He ran articles, focusing on campaign finance discrepancies. Big ones. So Santos could actually lose his seat, and they could have a special election. Bad news is that this stupid mope won with almost no campaigning, so a competent Republican could probably replace him. He will probably, at the least, lose his ability to sit on committees and vote on issues."
If he doesn’t then our country is even more f’d up than I thought.

That’s not Party affiliated only. That’s a Washington thing.
Not true. When they try to do the right thing they get voted out of office.
"Looks like he might have broken a law or two. It seems as though he cannot adequately account for how he earned enough money to loan his campaign $700,000.00"

He shows all the skills necessary.
What are you talking about? He already *was* POTUS according to his resume.

What did he do?
"Giant sack of shit ✅

No morals ✅"
"So you are trying to excuse bad behavior by pointing to worse behavior. I prefer to begin holding them accountable one at a time so maybe we can put a dent in the bigger problem you pointed out. If we never try then it will never get better. If we try and fail, at least we tried."
"While broke, he loaned his campaign 700,000 dollars. That's a giant red flag. As soon as they discover where that money actually came from there are definitely going to be campaign finance violations."
"No.

I think that two wrongs don't make a right and that we should condemn both. We should always be asking; compared to what? So that we can get a sense of proportion. Politicians lie. Not just republicans, contrary to the majority of popular reddit belief.

I absolutely unequivocally agree with you; we need to start holding them accountable - Sure let's start with this lying jerk George Santos but that is just the tip of the iceberg. He hasn't even had the opportunity to screw over constituents like these other politicians who have been in power for decades. And why have we not held any other politicians accountable seemingly ever in the past?!?

I think the republicans are a disastrous party. I think the democrats are even worse."
I think republicans are liars and con artists. Democrats are inept idiots. When we put the two together we get screwed.
So he is good at *something*?
"McCarthy is close to his 'Lonesome Rhodes' moment, and I want it on ppv."
Something-ish ?
"At the end of the day, making and keeping their word is nothing that GOP pols are known for. That makes them unfit partners for the job of governing the nation. I wish it were different  but any push to 'keep them honest' will have to come from the rank and file voter and too many of them are married to their propaganda fantasy. That leaves the Democrats and the non-aligned to call a halt to their nonsense by voting DOWN every GOP candidate so that we can 'right size' their voice in the decision we make going forward. Despite the gerrymandering, there should be no such thing as a 'safe district'."
"I don't know, except that the house has rules and they seem like they are following the rules(no reporting to the contradiction that I've seen anyway).  

I'm wondering, is there even a downside to this? This is hilarious, they are shooting themselves in the foot, losing time to affect policy, etc.  Honestly I just can't stop laughing about it. The only thing I am concerned about is the hard right wing extremists getting their way."
Cons are negotiating with terrorists.. extortionists.. criminal behavior is their way..
"If they elect someone other than McCarthy they wouldn’t have to give into or follow his concessions, although to get the gang of 20 to vote for that person they would have to, so I think they’re trying to get everything they want and until they do he won’t be elected, if he gives them everything then his power is gutted and the gang of 20 will rule."
"I must say though, watching the trainwreck unfold has been rather amusing!"
I wish the democrats (specifically the squad) did this with Nancy pelosi. We might have seen some Medicare for all or something. . .
"I think this is the right way to think about it. Everything we do comes down to behaving honorably, and Republicans come up remarkably short regarding the whole honor thing.

Tangentially, we should take care not to dismiss the probability that paralyzing the government may be the plan. It's a pretty standard play for the GOP:

1. Fuck something up
2. Wait for it to crash
3. Point at it and say, ""Oh look - it's fucked up - let's get rid of it.""

Republicans hate our traditions of democratic self-government. Their project is to tear it all down and replace it with plutocracy."
"I find it kind of hilarious but more infuriating. They participated in an attempted coup and yet here they are. I am beside myself that the DOJ has not stopped them. It is all just too bizarre for words, isn’t it?"

"...combined with the massive wealth transfer that is borrowing $30 trillion in everyone's name while lowering tax rates appreciably for a few households.  


FWIW, $30T is the same amount as borrowing $50/week from every American alive from 1981 through today...11,600,000,000 'person-years'."
"You skipped a step after 2. 3 should be point at it and say ""look what the Democrats did""."
That is fair. This is Democracy manifest.
"That is crazy, what a circus and just adds to the ineptness of these Republicans, I hope their supporters are happy. I know MAGA’s think this is just funny. Sad."
"Either they mean the next speaker would have to live with the concessions *in order to get voted in* by the same crazies, or they're wrong. At the start of each term they can redraw the rules so if say the Democrats win next time, they can just get rid of them again."
Yes on the rest of your comments. Unreal that it is a possibility.
"Definitely a good idea to show appreciation. Gotta admit the guy tries and often succeeds in doing what is right like calling Demar Hamlin’s parents after Demar’s cardiac arrest during Bills vs. Bengals game. Comforting, classy move."

Reduced to the state maximum punitive damages.  The state sets limits but does not allow the jury to be informed about those limits. Which is why they often award puitive damages far in excess of the states legal limits.

"No, McCarthy is a spineless moron with zero ethics or morals. Further, there's no such thing as a fiscal conservative. The bigger the train wreck Republicans choose the better as far as I'm concerned, it might finally wake some of the so called independents up."
"We want Jeffries for speaker.  If a few reasonable republicans want to exit the clown show and vote for him, great.  Otherwise, let them have their barroom brawl.  If they can't even agree with themselves on rules and a speaker, there's no way they're gonna get their shit together to pass anything that needs to go to conference with the senate.

TBH, I'm hoping for a dark brandon move where Biden takes the fact that the GOP house isn't passing a budget to run the government by executive action.  Call the abdication of responsibility by the house an emergency and just use the military budget to fund the government."
"if it has to be a Republican, I'd rather try to get to a more moderate person than McCarthy."
I’m gonna have to start splitting my tickets because this kind of incompetence is stunning.
I’m a bit ambivalent. On the one hand a weak speaker who can’t whip enough votes might mean some Republicans are free to work with Dems. On the other hand the clown show is almost guaranteed.
Upvote for LOTR reference.
Yep. Fuck em all
I’m waiting for the My Pillow Guy to show up in a pillow cape and say “I will save you all”.
It would have to be Independents; Republicans seem completely and utterly oblivious to the real world.
"I’ve used Obamacare, I’m all for socialized healthcare especially if I do t get taxed for it, simply re-route existing trillions. But it for sure needs help. To be fair Barack even said he just wanted it passed to any degree before he left."
But realistically somethings going to give and someone with an R next to their name is going to be voted and pass.
"I agree Jeffries is the ideal speaker and I really wish five Republicans would switch sides. But, not going to happen unless they are ready to retire in January 2025. 

A potential strategic move for the Democrats in the current situation would be to offer up a genuine moderate Republican as speaker. For example, Fred Upton or Jaime Herrera Beutler, both of who voted to impeach Trump. Chances are that no Republican will even choose to switch for a sane Republican, but if five or more did that would mean they and the Democrats would organize the House. Committees, chairmanships, etc. And it would make MAGAs very, very unhappy. Even with all the necessary compromises on spending to make this happen it would make the next two years not nearly so bad. And if the Republicans don't go for it then the Democrats just look even more mature and sensible compared to the clown car party."
Agreed. These are the people who are going to try to pass bills to make abortions illegally nationally. F them.
The Republicans gutted it so hard and then pointed at it as an example of Democrats not doing anything. But so many people can get coverage that couldn't before
You cannot trust any republican.
"It really sucks having views that most rational people would view as being ""Right of Center"" but then you look at the people in Congress with an (R) and it really makes you shake your head.

"There is no living Republican party leader now in power that I can respect. They each put party above nation. They each disregard the fundamental principles of democracy in order to get their way. Their party permitted a known tax cheat to remain on the debate stage and pretend to be legitimate. The party rubber stamped his profligate borrowing that 'probably' added $6T of additional borrowing to the national debt...a massive transfer of wealth from ALL to Some...deficit spending always does. And when in a position to convict Trump on his second impeachment, they each found a way to vote to acquit. Shameful disavowal of respect for the rule of law.  


Murkowski, Collins, Romney...All of them are the 'least irrationational' members of their party but all still worthy of being on my shit-list."
I love my in-laws. They vote Republican because it’s all they know and all they understand.
Adam Kinzinger seems to be about the most decent out of all republicans. So of course they didn’t like him. His own party and family disown him for supporting impeachment for Trump.
"None of the current ones, some are just less awful than others. It's like picking the nicest serial killer, this one killed them fast so that was nice since that one tutored them for days."

""One of Roosevelt's central beliefs was that the government had the right to regulate big business to protect the welfare of society. However, this idea was relatively untested. Although Congress had passed the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890, former Presidents had only used it sparingly. So when the Department of Justice filed suit in early 1902 against the Northern Securities Company, it sent shockwaves through the business community. The suit alarmed the business community, which had hoped that Roosevelt would follow precedent and maintain a ""hands-off"" approach to the market economy. At issue was the claim that the Northern Securities Company—a giant railroad combination created by a syndicate of wealthy industrialists and financiers led by J. P. Morgan—violated the Sherman Antitrust Act because it was a monopoly. In 1904, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of the government and ordered the company dismantled. The high court's action was a major victory for the administration and put the business community on notice that although this was a Republican administration, it would not give business free rein to operate without regard for the public welfare.""

He says some head scratching things at times but I was in the military stationed in DC and had duty on thanksgiving and he came onto the base and brought all the soldiers a homemade plate of thanksgiving food at 8 pm just him and his wife. No media no staff nothing. And I’ll forever respect him for that gesture alone because I may disagree with some of his views but only a good person does that.
Why?
"Well, that doesn’t entirely surprise me: he was an Army captain and served in Iraq and Afghanistan. However, I’ll grant you there were probably a lot of other Army veterans that day (let alone the nonveterans) who didn’t lift a finger to make any on-duty soldiers’ Thanksgiving better, so good on him on that score, at least.

Still, his political positions across the board are pretty much heinous. Just read the summary on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cotton"

Substitute the Stars and Stripes for the Hakenkreuz, ""USA!"" for ""Sieg Heil!"" and a failed businessman with a bad combover for a failed artist with a square moustache...and you get a fairly good idea... except that the failed artist was actually a corporal decorated for bravery in combat!

It was Suozzi’s job to uncover all of these lies. That he did not do so indicates he is completely incompetent and had no business representing anyone, anywhere.

Who else was supposed to expose Santos for the sociopath that he is? Him? Me? Of course not. Suozzi owes everyone an apology for his complete incompetence."
We need Matt Gaetz as speaker.
This is their brand feature.
How many jabs have you gotten
"The author, Tom Suozzi, wasn't running against Santos. He chose instead to run for Governor, which he did not win."
Wtf .. what did you expect from 'him and his campaign '?
"Ok, not his fault.  (Although he didn’t uncover any of this in 2020, when he was the opponent.)

It is incredible that no responsibility was laid at the feet of the Dem who ran, though, right? He repeatedly blames the media instead, never the campaign"

But no. 
And I’m glad he’s such a fuckup. But also, his followers don’t want unity or pride. They want anger and cruelty and petty hate. That’s why they like him in the first place. And he’s too dumb to have seen the bigger picture."

"He could never do that because he would have had to agree that the CDC and the medical community were right and he was wrong. 

He was happy to send a million people to their unnecessary deaths to stroke his ego."

"Mainly narcissism. People that talk like that tend not to care about others, at least to an extent. Also, I wouldn’t say it’s most republicans, at least not from what I have met.

They want nothing to change, since I have all I need, and don’t care what others need."
"As Jesus himself was famously quoted in First Thisllowndalibz: *And The Lord continued to speak from the mount, ""Verily I say unto thee - thou shalt spare no effort in mocking thy neighbors, their progeny, and their meager belongings.

"Just to be clear, we're talking about Trump -right? -The hero of all the bully-bastards out there... The guy who made bigotry great again?"
"This is the best summation of how Fascism/Tumpism works. They enjoy being trolls. You are considered the fool for offering something beyond insults. They don't want to solve anything; they want to trash others because they are obsessed with hierarchy and want to believe they are above someone else. 

""Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.""
Jean-Paul Sartre"
"Prior to Trump, I recall republicans having an air of superiority rather than this modern bullying behavior. On topics like abortion and gay marriage they’d have this smug attitude that they knew they were in the right because they had a hotline to the jeebus. Another big difference was that republicans were all a bunch of sticks in the mud- they were against drinking, pot, casual sex, and anything fun. I recently heard Joe Rogan saying he was a conservative because he likes to “drink beer and watch sports”… huh? As GenX I grew up with Reagan inspired conservatives that seemed to make “boring” their defining characteristic. The xenophobia and the prosperity theology were always a part of it. But they were conservative as the name implies- they believed men were to wear suits & ties and women should be in dresses past the knees. Never in a million years would I have thought those republicans would support a pussy grabbing, grifter, narcissist.
I think a lot of MAGA republicans previously had no interest in politics. Trump came along and gave them permission to be bigots and assholes and it was the rallying cry they were waiting for. This, of course, works well for the rich GOP members who have always manipulated the narrative so that their real politics (keeping the rich rich) wasn’t discussed. My father was 67 when Trump ran for president and he never once talked about politics before that. Now he’s a full fledged MAGA idiot. For as much as he says he’s into politics He couldn’t tell you a fucking thing about actual policy or how the government works."
"Because on substance they're wrong 90% of the time, so they always need to go low."

"I still think the underlying theme for the Democrats should be **kindness**.  I would set up a hell of a contrast with the Republicans.  I think most people respond well to the kindness in people.  Even my Trump-loving friends appreciate kindness.

Your opinion is not reality. Bullies are split evenly between republicans and democrats. Definitely not “most”
"To be completely fair, though this has been my experience with the Right, it has also been my experience with the left. When debating the left I usually get threats, sometimes even to my life, told my opinion doesn't matter, called names, giving false facts or a refusal to read data. Been told things like, ""you just an idiot"" even if I show exact data that contradicts what they say because it is easier than accepting they may be wrong. It is DEFINITELY an individual problem from people on both sides. Not to say that applies to anyone here of course, just that it isn't a ""right vs left"" issue."
It’s actually funny to me as a republican because this is the exact same thing we think about y’all
I don’t know I feel like overall especially online Democrats are equally as bad at bullying. I honestly don’t know how you could think differently. Woke became a bad term because of liberal bullying not because it was a bunch of ideas being proposed.
I only know one republican who talked like that…made it to the top…
Why are you asking liberals why republicans do something? How would we know lmao
That's their base.

"And they have massive stockpiles of guns and ammunition that they will use to kill you and everyone you love the second they think they can get away with it.

Luckily they're a minority and we are still able to to buy guns."
Yep. Because it works.
They’ve cultivated that base. 35 years ago the asshole bullies who worked blue collar union jobs voted Democrat.
They have been bullies since Gingrich

"Well, good to know that portion of society has labeled itself.  Whenever I meet someone republican or conservative, I immediately know they are not someone I want to become good friends with.  Smile and nod, keep at arms length.

While I am sure there are some good people in that group, I cannot imagine how a ""good"" person can br conservative.  Not every liberal is a ""good"" person, but anyone who votes republican is hurting others and the planet at large in doing so."

"But do you see they hypocrisy to say that to me after the post above saying the exact same thing?  


I was raised republican, then a democrat for 10 years, now I am a registered independent and only vote based on policy. I have worked with people who are extremes on both sides and have had the exact same experience both ways. With the country having tens of millions of people that are republican and democrat and both groups say the other group refuses facts, plays the victim card, and debates like a bully, would you not think that may be it is in-fact both groups that do this and not ""my side is the good side for certain"" and these millions of people are all just lying?"
"Meh, it's happened to me too.  I've been told I would be put up against the wall after the revolution because I'm a progressive instead of a communist.

But it's *rare* and an edge case.  There are idiots everywhere.  But on the Right it's become part of their identity to behave that way.  While there's that idiot I mentioned previously, I have had plenty of positive discussions with communists counter to that.

I've rarely ever had a political discussion with a conservative go well."
The problem with progressivism is that the goal posts keep getting moved and some fringe ideology has become mainstream within the party. We’ve also witnessed that women’s rights are under attack. Some woke ideas are excellent but a fair amount are hypocritical and cringey.
Do you not believe that a complete inability to be civil or to engage in conversation (your own words) is indicative of a lack of intelligence?
According to Karl Marx it always has been
"Yea, I thought about him. But that period was a red scare moment in time and then congress corrected itself after the Warren court denounced McArthyism/Hooverism via several key decisions. But since Gingrichism took over the republican party there has been no correction. There is a straight line from the Republican Revolution of 1994 though the Tea Party in the mid 2000s and onto Trumpism and the embrace of authoritarianism. These are the same people."
"Yeah, the origins of American conservatism lie in defense of the monarchy. It’s always been about power and never about humanity with them."
"No, I don’t think that Democrats flat out deny reality to the same extent Republicans do. If one person says it’s raining and another says it’s sunny, do you also think there’s no way to know which one is denying reality there too?"
In civilized debate we avoid insult and slander so as to not allow the conversation to devolve from discourse to argument. Like I said. Point out the fault in someones argument. Just calling them stupid proves nothing. Anyone can do that. Right or wrong.
"Why does the Marx-supporting faction of the left support gun legislation? 

I'm a center left gun supporter. Things like Jan 6, or police brutality, or the Ukrainian revolution remind me why a well armed populace is the key to liberty."
"The following is very respectful to your point because I appreciate your view and only believe in civilized discussion as I ultimately believe we all want nothing but good for the world and just have different views on how to get there.  


Again, there are 70 million people in the US that believe democrats flat out deny reality as well so can we not even entertain the idea that may be we are wrong in some instances? Would it not seem extremely naïve to think there is no way there is any instance in which a republican is right on an issue and a democrat wrong? If we cannot do that then we are a cult not a political party in my humble opinion.  


But let's take examples, and again I am not a republican even remotely but I do know a few instances in which democrats denied reality not anecdotally. Unless you mean anecdotal examples don't happen either in which I could go on and on haha.   


None anecdotal examples first, Biden recently called for a dead person during his speech, the white house's response was that he did not do that and he just missed this person in question. Democrats argued the same thing for days even though we all saw him do it plainly, that is denying reality right there in a funny sense, but I will be more serious.  


Democrats will also argue that abortion is all about the religious side of things and it is not killing anyone. Over 95% of biologist agree that abortion is killing a human life. Now that does not mean abortion is wrong, nor does it mean pro-life is correct, but democrats that argue ""this is not killing anyone"" is completely wrong based on the unfaltering, clear cut science that it is ending a human life. But we could still say that human isn't a person, doesn't have rights, the mother's rights trump it, whatever. But democrats openly argue the opposite at the highest level despite being entirely wrong in the science. This is again openly denying reality in order to push a political position.  


For more anecdotal evidence that may prove a larger point. I AM NOT SUPPORTING THE ELECTION FRAUD ARGUMENT AT ALL FIRST AND FOREMOST. During the 2020 election my vote was lost. What I mean is in my state you can actually track your vote. It was submitted that night and the following morning was missing. This happened to 8 of my family members across 2 states. We all called and were essentially told over and over again that ""we never voted in the 2020 election as there is no ballot"". I can promise you as someone how has voted before there was no error. It was filled out and submitted and in the case of error they would actually still have my ballot. So for 7 of us our ballot was never found and our vote not counted, one of us continued pushing for a week by calling everywhere they could, at the end of the week they found the ballot and submitted it. This did happen to me. I believe it was not malicious, I believe it was poor organization by my state and true human error, however I can understand why some republicans think this is some great fraud because they lost. On the other hand I have been told that is just an entirely made up story by democrats who refuse to accept the reality that something like this can happen. But the reality is my vote was lost in the 2020 election and if it was counted I was never confirmed that it did so I just have to wonder if my vote mattered. Now the majority of the elected officials I voted for in my state were elected anyway so I never worried tooooo much about my vote haha."
I mean men can have babies care to discuss?
They do.  Liberals want only the police to have guns.  They also admit the police are racist and corporate owned.  Pretty fucked.
">	there are 70 million people in the US that believe democrats flat out deny reality as well so can we not even entertain the idea that may be we are wrong in some instances? Would it not seem extremely naïve to think there is no way there is any instance in which a republican is right on an issue and a democrat wrong? 

And if we’ve done that and come to the conclusion that no, they’re still wrong in that belief? 

>	None anecdotal examples first, Biden recently called for a dead person during his speech, the white house’s response was that he did not do that and he just missed this person in question. Democrats argued the same thing for days even though we all saw him do it plainly, that is denying reality right there in a funny sense, but I will be more serious.

I don’t think the contents of a speech matter nearly as much as the contents of a law, which is when Republicans deny reality.

What constitutes a human life is entirely a political question. Killing a living human cell isn’t, but “this is killing someone” is a question of personhood.

The claim of “voter/election fraud doesn’t happen” is a shorthand for the claim “it doesn’t happen in amounts meaningful enough to change an election or support the laws that Republicans want to enact.”"
"Yes, trans men can, depending on how their medical transition has impacted their fertility, still become pregnant. What’s the confusion there?"
Only the indoctrinated believe that’s true. This is a perfect example of woke crossing a line into the outrageous.
"Sorry, you think it’s indoctrination to acknowledge that trans men can become pregnant?"
"Where’s the line drawn? Are you willing to accept trans racial or trans species? If you don’t accept those theories why not? At the end of the day it’s gotten to the point some people are willing to accept people’s imaginations or feelings as long as they fit in a certain category. We already know those two groups along with transage are making a push to become accepted along with the map community. 

It would be interesting to hear how far that you think acceptance should go or as a progressive does it never end? You do understand that these theories and promoting them is potentially dangerous and requires more significant studies that aren’t influenced by ideology just science which points towards mental illness and the shortcomings of our healthcare system."
"When there's evidence that any of those approaches results in better outcomes than therapy to get a person to embrace their assigned race/age/species. That evidence base unambiguously exists for trans people, and your ""woke gone too far"" is just advocacy for conversion therapy couched in dog whistles."
I wonder what the anti ACA/universal healthcare crowd is saying now.
"You okay over there, Fox?"
"Naw, really!"
We would be much better off with universal healthcare and taxes for undesirable and preventable lifestyle behavior such as drinking smoking and obesity. Our system is so inefficient currently.
N.S. Sherlock award winning effort here.
Why the fuck would we want to click a Fox News link?
Some of them unsurprisingly think Obamacare and ACA are different
My sentiments exactly. They must be melting down and I bet this isn't a story for the airwaves. Just their website.
I have to admit I expect to enjoy the Republican flailing as it plays out. This will put the GOP on full display. There plans and priorities will be shown for what they are. Nothing!
McCarrthy was denied a speakership a few years back for similar reasons. They settled in Boehner instead
"They had him change districts when they redrew the lines because he would have lost his old district. His new district is also filled with the most self centered MAGA idiots on the west coast so it's no surprise he isn't nationally likable. 

The only thing that sucked more than McCarthy on the ballot was his democratic opponent. Like they must have made a backroom deal with him to ensure he got elected. I can't wait to move out of the foothills FML."
"So, his legacy is that he's historically small."
Fuck this RINO
"The all mighty promises, promises, promises."
McCarthy is the epitome of Dunning-Kruger.
"They’ve been on full display for decades now. Too many people are still to dumb, corrupt or outright vicious for them to lose as much support as they should."
This is definitely a good way to build a coalition…insult everyone who thinks differently than me

One example"
"Yes, I can point to many."
So maybe try reading the article and not the headline. The “voter suppression” is increasing penalties for election crimes and giving local law enforcement the legal authority to investigate said crimes. That doesn’t really sound like taking away any right…
Okay can we hear one?
"Trump and senate republicans pushing through judges that overturned Roe v. Wade; NC's electoral maps diluting voting power; the bill filed to eliminate porn online in the US; FL Senator, and former Gov. Scott subverting a state referendum and removing voting rights from felons; The whole Jan 6/voter suppression/alternative electors kerfuffle. Need I go on?"
"I have more, obviously we won't agree on how we see things so have a good day."
Same to you!
"The right-wing war on trans people is a war on bodily autonomy, a war on the entire GLBT community, and a war on women."
I bet a large percentage of the polling was done pre the fall of RvW.
The fact that these scumbags get one vote surprises me.
I hope that that drives people to the polls again in 2024 so we can get some shit done
Me too!
No debate. Just tear the statues down without notice or fanfare
I always go treason cause ya know facts
"I have red pill family members.  I just go with the point:  I support our US military and I thought you did, too.  After all, our dad served.  Well, what do you call someone who celebrates people who kill our US military service members?"
"But, treason isn't necessarily morally objectionable, slavery is.

Edit- to add to this.  John Brown was charged w treason.  And, I don't think he did anything wrong.
Slavery violates the categorical imperative were treason doesn't.  Our founding fathers committed treason to form our country."
"Having grown up in The South, I know what a tiresome and oftentimes futile argument it can be. The Lost Cause mythology is VERY ingrained in a lot of white people in the southern states. It’s tough to argue with facts when your opponent has quite literally made up his or her own history. Even knowing their script (which is highly predictable), you’re debating against distorted history at best and outright falsehoods at worse. 

The treason argument is indeed the most solid one simply because the definition of treason is pretty clear. A rational and educated person can easily understand why you can’t be a patriotic pro-American and also a Confederate sympathizer at the same time. However, if you think conservatives in the south have a problem with double-think, cognitive dissonance and downright contradicting values, woah boy, you’re in for a shock!"
"I refer to it as ""the loser flag"" in conversation. Seems to make an impression."
"Hell yea, I'm glad your in it to win it"
"Re number 2: I have read that Lincoln's primary focus was reuniting the country, not necessarily ending slavery, although he did come around.

 But, yes, the Confederate flag is the flag of an enemy nation, even if that ""nation"" lasted only four years. It is a flag of rebellion against the U.S."
Treason against what? Lee etc. saw the USA as an umbrella organization to protect states’ interests. The state claimed first loyalty - like France in EU (🇫🇷=Virginia; 🇪🇺=🇺🇸). 🇨🇦 is currently facing a gentler form of this with sovereignty laws in some provinces.
TL;dr Joe Biden is a racist
Nah.
Perhaps it's just the fact I don't live in a former Confederate state. But I really don't give a fuck about statues or flags. It has absolutely nothing to do with being liberal or progressive. Ignorance is bliss I guess.
"I agree with your basic premise, that it is better to approach from the treason-angle than the slavery one, but I tend to agree with old Samuel Clements on this one: Don't argue with fools, they will drag you down to their level and beat you with experience."

The leaders in Africa sold their own people to other countries.

Republican Abraham Lincoln ended slavery."
"Obviously they should all go, but you have to be able to defend why at the dinner table , and .are the argument 1in city council meetings and such to get them torn as own.lol

Or you plan on wiggling your nose a d wishing them awayay??"
Just make sure you know what the statue is or who is supposed to be the morons in my state were tearing down indigenous people statues misguided rebellious shit heads burning shit down in the name of BLM.
I mean they should be in a museum not just torn down
It is just a far more solid argument.

"Ending slavery was done in punishment for the war and because large numbers of AAs fought to defend the country, giving the abolitionists the ability to make the argument "" are we really gonna send these men who fought for us back into bondage?!?!""


Everyone was racist , both sides had slaves the people like John Brown who wa Ted actually equally were flipping unicorns"
"Lee especially committed treason as he specifically swore an oath to defend the US and constitution.

"Other cities can follow this model. We don’t have a direct democracy. Not every decision needs public debate. Leaders are elected to act. 

“In October, Judge D. Eugene Cheek Sr., of the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond, noted that Richmond’s City Council had adopted an ordinance in 2020 authorizing the city to remove Confederate statues on city-owned property.  He said that the city had the right to dismantle the Hill statue and donate it to the museum. The general’s remains would also be reburied at a cemetery in Culpeper, about 85 miles north, Judge Cheek ruled in October.”

That may not have been a mistake.
"If they are museum worthy. The majority of confederate statues were generic, mass produced lawn sculpture from a catalog quickly put up during the civil rights movement as a form of intimidation and declaration of white supremacy."

This is sadly true. Just didn't think about it that way. Slippery slope.
Yep done way after the civil war was over. Still tells a piece of history that you just described. Not sure why you are opposed to it being in a museum in such a fashion. You would rather just act like that didn't happen?
Do you know how much stuff in museums are associated with negative things? Confederate statues ain't new. You think ancient torture devices is something that doesn't belong in a museum? Ain't anything positive about those. Still a part of history that should be included in museums. All museums news to do is explain the context of when these statues were built and why.
Look at my other comments here where I already addressed this.
Yup.. and they do not have scripted arguments to muddy the waters.
"That is not a dirty game lol, but if you have to play dirty to do the objectively right thing them you do it... God knows all conservatives do is play dirty.

It is just a fact that the US government and vast majority of Americans were not really any better on slavery or racism in 1860s America. So it doesn't male sense to use that as the justification for not flying the confederate stuff and while "" it was put up for racist reasons"" us true, they get to deflection with "" it is about honoring those who fought bravely"". Which is not really true but sounds good."
"It is the truth... Biden has flip flopped or evolved how ever you want to look at it depending on what he thought the majority wanted him to do.. 


It depends on if we want leaders who do unpopular things they think are correct or go with popular opinion.. which is  a legit debate"
"Ye old "" I have the bestest rebuttal ever but instead of using it, I'm going to spend the same time and effort to claim I will not waste the time and effort"". Probably my favorite sad deflection.

There’s a ton of precedent of winning Arguments on this topic. Over 1000 confederate statues have been pulled down. We’re not starting from scratch.
"Why? They are mostly generic and meaningless. If a museum curator wants it and they have room, sure they can take it. But most of it is meaningless lawn sculpture lie what you can but at home depot. That stuff isn’t art. Just because it’s old, doesn’t mean it has historic or artistic value. How many copies of silent sentinel do we need in a museum? 1, 5, 500?

“A large share of Confederate statues are of nameless, generic soldiers, like the one the protesters took down in Durham. Towns erected them in the early 20th century, decades after the Civil War, because their Confederate mythologies helped to justify Jim Crow laws in the South that oppressed black citizens, Taber Andrew Bain, a librarian at Virginia Commonwealth University, pointed out on Twitter.

The statues are often called the “Silent Sentinel,” “Single Soldier,” or something similar, and depict a regular soldier in Confederate uniform staring solemnly into the distance, at ease, with feet spread—a stance called “parade rest,” according to art historian Lola Arellano-Fryer, who wrote about the statues for Hyperallergic. The statutes proliferated specifically because they were cheap.”

"Most confederate monuments were erected years or decades *after* the US civil war was over. 

They don’t belong in a museum at all. They exist purely as a method to oppress people."
And those arguments are exactly what I stated.. treason and they were only put up for racist reasons.
">Why? They are mostly generic and meaningless. If a museum curator wants it and they have room, sure they can take it. But most of it is meaningless lawn sculpture. Just because it’s old, doesn’t mean it has historic or artistic value. How many copies of silent sentinel do we need in a museum? 1, 5, 500?

Where did I say all of them? It's as simple as museums should be provided the opportunity to house however many of these they want instead of just destroying them as some claim. If a specific group of people want more of these preserved they can donate to museums leading to a win win.

Where was I disagreeing with that fact? I am aware a ton maybe even majority of the statues went up way post civil war."
">Most confederate monuments were erected years or decades after the US civil war was over. 


Where did I disagree and not say that

>They don’t belong in a museum at all. They exist purely as a method to oppress people.

Even that has meaning for museums. You think torture devices and the like don't belong in a museum."
"Storage Space is a major issue for most museums. And yeah make them available, but as we’ve been seeing most aren’t wanted. They are old street lamps basically."
Good point honestly.
"Sure, but like I said bet one could get a bunch of MAGA supporters to donate money so that museums take more in. Regardless of how long they are kept museums would still be better off.

Honestly not that I care much about, but it would be kind of cool to have all the crappy Confederate statues in one place kind of like the soldier statues in China. Would be worried though if not done right the wrong kind of people would venerate the statues though...."
"If somebody wants to create a confederate sculpture cemetery on private land go for it “hey pa, how come all these statues is the same man?…well thats just how it was back then.”"
Lmao
The answer to the question is that if a company can not pay their employees a living wage then maybe that company shouldn't exist.
Seeing as many companies are making record profits right now it would just be as simple as maybe paying workers more
"They can pay more by cutting back on their own salaries. CEO can cut back on their, using my company CEO salary as an example, 13 mil salary and disperse that to the working force. If a company is able to work fully remote, that should save them money too. If they have buildings, they can lease them out to companies creating more income for them. I’m sure there are numerous ways to pay employees more. But it starts at a cut from the top, I assume, and most CEO don’t want to cut their 13 mil salary (insane how much money that is for one family every year). 

As far as “record profits”. We would need to look at the earnings sheets and view it in percentages. If you look at it for dollar, it will look like these companies are making “record profits” because of inflation. But when we look at the percentages, the profits average to about the same if not a little more. 

Now for a living wage, this is not black and white. No one can define a living wage except by using broad and indirect language. Since a living wage is subjective, it can’t be nailed. A lot of people don’t make the greatest decision with their money, tons more are indeed underpaid. I believe the issue for that roots at the cost of living (COL), starting at these apartment complexes. There is no reason why a 800 sqft apartment with no washer and dryer should be $2000 a month. I believe it’s fueled by greed, but I don’t have knowledge in that industry so I could be completely wrong. 

There is a TON of work to be done and that can be done to help others out with COL. We just have to identify the root problem and work together to find solutions."
So you would rather have thousands of people lose their jobs?
But they won’t.  CEO and certain others will get larger Year end bonuses.
"13,000,000/164,000 (worldwide apple employees) = $79.2682926829 per employee as a raise. Just saying you can throw out numbers and claims but you need to back it up with numbers. the only number you gave would give the employees an extra $50 after taxes and stuff, probable even less. Im not saying you're wrong but id like to see actual numbers and not just words."
What is a job that can’t provide a life? Slavery
No. Slavery is when you work and are owned by the boss. Here you can go start your own company. Whats stopping you?
"My family isn’t wealthy, but that doesn’t matter. It is a waste of time debating people like you. I don’t formulate my politics around what is best for me. I do it to make our country better. I live my life as a libertarian but that will not work for an entire society. You can see it all around us. We can’t even provide the basics like trash service and clean drinking water. What’s stopping us? Selfish capitalists who want 100% of the benefits from society; they just don’t want to pay to maintain it."
"Here are a couple of issues:

1. Not everyone has enough savings to start a company and wait until it turns a profit. And that company might fail. You hear about the successes, but how often have those same people failed? How many have failed and never succeeded?
1. Starting a company means you get taxed more than if you were a W2 employee. Self-employed people pay the full FICA tax which is normally split between employer and employee. This is usually called the ""self-employment tax""."
"My family isn't wealthy either nor am I. This isn't a political question. I am asking to actually understand the math if its possible. Based on what I have seen its not, so I came to see how other people address it with actual numbers."
So at the end of the day you won't open a company and then complain about someone who did open one up that they are doing it all wrong? Im just not understanding your point here and would like to understand it.
I outlined some important financial consideration with starting a company and why not everyone does it and you somehow understood that as my critiquing someone for doing it wrong. I don't understand how you made that link.
This whole discussion has been about you believing companies should be paying a significant amount  more and that they could. Then you said you not everyone could open a business so the ones that do are doing it wrong by not paying people significantly more making them slaves
"> you believing companies should be paying a significant amount more and that they could

Can you link my post where I wrote that?

Assuming I did. When your company makes record profits, it's obvious that you can pay more."
"That the OP topic. And you said 
>Selfish capitalists who want 100% of the benefits from society; they just don’t want to pay to maintain it.

What is your whole view if I misunderstood you on the topic?"
Soon: conservative Arizona state congress change law to allow doctors to be Prosecuted for providing abortion services.
good. keep sticking down the down. make roe v. Wade settled law again.
"I'm sure that some of them will try, but this stuff is really unpopular even in deep red states (look at Kansas for an example of what happens when this is on the ballot). Arizona is already trending bluer every cycle, and if the GOP pushes harder then this simply becomes a wedge issue against them instead of a reliable source of fundraising when Roe was still in place."
Can I get a psychologist to explain why republicans keep doing the things they are fighting against?
these republican politicians are the real threat to democracy
At this rate we need an Every Accusation Is A Confession bot
"This criminal behavior in Republicans just keeps on popping up! Why?! Because all the hooping & hollering by Republicans about voter fraud is just their PROJECTING? MUST BE!I don't see any Democrats getting busted for this stupidity. 

Looks like the Republicans just breed this stuff!"
They reveal more and more of what they ARE and what they really THINK = fraudsters!!!!!
"Not a psychologist but I’m pretty sure for a lot of them, they’re constantly thinking about committing crimes so they assume everyone else is too"
"IANAP, but in my theory of choice the blatant hypocrisy is just a form of projecting their insecure and narcissistic superiority complex. They think they (and people they like) deserve to be exceptions to their own rules. It's authoritarian. The blatancy just lets them rub outsiders' faces in it and revel in the anger of their 'enemies'. Like a child who's knowingly and flauntingly acting out just to annoy, deriving glee from the other's confusion and frustration."
"They just want to shift the blame to others for their crimes, that’s it"
"Not a psychologist but I imagine that these whack jobs *actually* think they are doing good by “cheating” and committing voter fraud to get their guy in. Like to them, it’s something they must do to “save the country”, not committing a crime. To them they think what they are doing is this sort of rebellion for the greater good.

Not sure how they apply that to their idols being arrested for actual grooming as opposed to LGBTQ people not grooming at all but, clearly these people ain’t right in the head. Lots of denial, projection, misinformation, narcissism…"
"Because both the fraud and the ""attempts to stop it"" have the same goal in mind, being to obtain power by any means"
"They know that they are good, so that means the people they know are bad must be planning and doing even worse things."
MAGA stupidity - could we expect anything else?

Lol Maga tears. InVaSiOn Of PrIvaCy!
"It's fucking hilarious how butthurt they get, especially when paint liberals as pussies that are ultra-sensitive over every little thing. Invasion of Privacy? Remember when all the Republicans and Fake Fox News were harassing Obama to release his birth certificate, wasn't that an Invasion of Privacy?"
"""ThIs iS an InVaSioN oF PriVaCy! NoW iT's yoUR tUrn!"" 🤡"
Trump himself said he would release them. He just got a little “push.”
"RUpubliclown politicians are doing their hypocrisy 'thang.' They fill a river with laundered dark money protected by legislation of privilege yet deny any potential of abuse. ""Nope! Nothing to see here!""

They parade their clown cars around & squabble among themselves as the influence peddling literally jumps the DC curbs & breaks down the doors of the Capitol. Fabulous... Just look at the damage tRUmp did to the crooked hierarchy of that party! Just what the House GOP likes though ... chaos! Now, a gay liar on Putin's payroll comes along to stabilize their cartel? What could possibly be more appropriate for the Republican party?! 

Democrats should order pizza & spectate this GOP 'food fight.' Mel Brooks should lampoon this with 'Lawless & Disorderly.' 🎭"
"They voted for Trump sight unseen. That is ridiculous enough. What's even worse is that many of them are buying Trump NFT's and shares in DWAC without doing even the littlest bid of due diligence. They're boasting about spending their families' savings and mortgaging their homes on these sketchy ""investments"". The raw data is out there now in his tax returns, yet I doubt they'll be curious enough to even look into them."
"Does the Maga crowd realize every president since Nixon has released their tax returns? 

I blame the Gop. At first pass, it looks like they aren't vetting their candidates. But I think they truth is, they know exactly what they are doing - exploiting low information voters."
We’re not outraged at all
It’s an invasion of privacy from people who demand to know everything about those they like and support people who want 1984 to be real.
the projection is absolutely unfuckingreal
Things that didn't happen...lol

"He said he would after he was through being audited.  Which he never was being audited.  That was a lie, which makes like lie #5000 this year"

"They voted for him for largely five reasons.

He had an R after his name.

He has a big mouth and bullies people with it.

His faux-religiosity.

His faux-patriotism.

He hates the same people they do."
LOL. Good one!
I wish that was the case. I’ve almost always voted red but the new type of republicans make it harder for me to vote that way anymore.
"Only #5000 this year? If you had said #5000 this week, I *might* buy it, but year is really stretching it."
"Aye, the irony.  He wasn't being audited when he was actually supposed to be."
Not really nay wasn’t he being auditee he was not getting the mandatory finance review which is part of the law.
"In general, he made bigotry fashionable again."
Harder. Hmm.  Explain to us why you voted for any Republican ever?
"And quasi-""glamourus."" 🙄"
Selfishly because of money
"Well yeah, non-billionaire and non-millionaire plebs do not use the loopholes as we CAN’T. Raising questions about what he does should then have every millionaire and billionaire not just investigated, BUT…close the damn loopholes!!!! Without that, nothing will be done.

Remember his debate with Hilary when she called him out back in 2016?? He replied saying he is using the loopholes that are legal and put in place by the politicians, he then told her to close the loopholes but followed up saying he knows she won’t because she too uses those same loopholes but more importantly her huge donor billionaires enjoy those same loopholes so she’d need to screw them over. And that’s why she won’t and that’s why No Politician will close them. And again, it’s not illegal, we just don’t use the system as we can’t afford the lawyers and finance people to make it worth it in the end.

It’s similar to how Elizabeth Warren pointed out how many rich get around the taxes by taking low salaries and get compensated in stock, but if you don’t cash out then you don’t pay capital gains, so they take out HUGE loans and use stock as collateral and in the end pay almost no tax in the end plus all the huge write offs."
Of course they do.
"CNN should have changed their name to Trump News Network 7 years ago. We know what's in his returns now. He's not President any longer, so how about we all move on from the dictator wannabe?"
"Because we haven’t known exactly what is in them. CNN isn’t the only network or media outlet talking about these today. And he’s running for president again, so we aren’t done with him yet."
"That's the problem. That motherfucker takes a shit, and every major media outlet goes off about the color and consistency."

"Its not surprising. All soceities are on a march toward more and more liberal values, inch by inch. As liberal values shift more liberal, conservative values too must shift over a bit or the republican party will be stuck in the stone age forever. Conservative doesn't mean ""anti-abortion"", ""freedom"", and ""pro-christian"" its simply the party of the past. The party of continuing to do things like we always have, because those ways have worked out well enough that we are all still here and not Nazi or communist. But everything changes and so must the republicans. If they dont budge they will disappear. 

As the past changes so must the conservative party."

It said ""Passantino has denied any wrongdoing and said he represented her 'honorably"" and 'ethically.'""  I noticed that that it did not name ""her,"" or even put ""her"" in quotes.  So, did she says that she represented Ms. Hutchinson honorably abd ethically, or did she represent ""her client"" [Trump] honorable and ethically?"

"The most effective pricing strategy for maximizing profit is not always increasing price. A company can increase revenue by way of decreasing price if the quantity of units transacted increases by a sufficiently large amount. Without even adopting this viewpoint, it’s not particularly hard to see this line of argumentation. In addition to this, it’s worth noting that policymakers have taken actions such as mobilizing the strategic petroleum reserves, and working with other nations to expand available oil supply, in addition to the fact that this time of year typically is characterized by lower demand for gasoline. Ultimately; the market for gasoline is HIGHLY oligopolistic, and behaves exactly like an oligopoly market would be predicted to behave facing these supply and demand shocks."

"Public perception is a powerful thing.

If they were being greedy they woukdn't just stop. They'd pretend to."
"I was listening to NPR, and they gave an example of how much gasoline costs vs. the price of crude and found we were paying the correct price. The greed goes all the way up to the source. Apparently, you can order some oil, and the tanker can be rerouted during its delivery because they found someone who is willing to pay more than you. Apparently, the sale isn't final until it's actually delivered.

I don't know how many industries operate like that, but oil is so important that buyers have no choice but to buy oil for one price and potentially pay more to ensure it's actually delivered."
"Corporate greed means oil companies have always charged as much as they can to maximize profits, but they have been doing this since their inception— decades ago. They didn’t just get greedy, they have always been maximizing profits. The price goes up for a number of other reasons."
"I've been screaming this from the hills.  Corporate greed is always present and thus isn't an adequate explanation.

But supply and demand are.  

When Americans drove less, the price of gas collapsed.  When we drive more and there was a supply shock, the price skyrocketed.

We are the cause of high gas prices.  We drive too much and in too big vehicles at too high speeds.  Want lower gas prices?  Use less gasoline.  This means accelerating slower, slower top speed, and coasting to red lights rather than jamming on your brakes.  These are remarkably simple and liveable solutions."
I find it interesting that the gas prices went down once the US election was over.
They didn't. Gas is still 5.00 a gallon.
Not just one thing is involved. It is never simple. One factor - Supply/Demand cycle. Anyone can keep on raising their prices as long as people will pay it and either through monopolies or collusion their are not alternatives to the product. If people stop buying or the government steps in then prices will go down until people start buying again.
"They are always greedy.  When supplies are limited they act on that greed, if they didn't we would run out of it because the main way to conserve something is to charge more.

These simple slogans are rarely helpful and are often counterproductive."
"Demand dropped in large part caise their greed forced people ro cut driving so they have to drop prices to sell more. 
Interest rate hikes ( by design) have slowed the economy further, killing Demand also prices dup in winter cause fewer peole taking road trips

They dont have to gouch when the demand out paces supply, but they do cause they can get away with it. 

Also, opening the strategic reserves  increased supplies. The other factor is that too much greed suddenly  makes high cost low range  evs more palatable"
Additionally sometimes large companies will sell at a loss to drive other companies out of business.  Prior to 2020 gas prices were low because OPEC increased production to drive fracking/tar sands out of business.  Those methods required at least $80bbl in 2010 dollars to break even.
This. Refineries are a billion dollar investment. With states like California saying they’re going ban the new sale of gas cars/trucks by 2035 you can safety make an assumption that demand for oil will drop and oil companies won’t get the return they need off new refineries.
Oil is a global commodity.
Are you joking? I assume so. Gas prices peaked in June and fell through the election.

Many things are global commidities. I just wonder how many can be sold and then sold to someone else midshipment.

"These are *anti*\-LGBTQ bills, and anti-woman bills. The GOP is attacking trans people so that they can roll back women's rights. Trans rights and women's rights are deeply connected. It's all about bodily autonomy, at root. There's a reason right-wingers obsess over trans women and ignore the existence of trans men: Defining ""man"" legally doesn't help their goal of oppressing women."
"Because making a separate group means they can be made a second class. Think black and white. 

There’s no legal or biological reason. It’s 100% right wing religious groups."
That really is an interesting point that I never hear addressed- why do they not care about trans men?
"Their goal is sensationalism, and for a number of reasons related to sexism and homophobia, people freak out more about trans women than they do trans men. So they obsess over trans women, because that's what gets people to irrationally freak out. Most anti-trans talking points are old anti-gay talking points, verbatim, and they're more effective used against trans women, thanks to old stereotypes."

Free universal healthcare like in every other modern country Sheesh is so obviously the issue.
"It's a multifaceted problem that requires a multifaceted solution. Increased regulations for gun sales and ownership are obvious things that should have been in place to begin with. Clamp down on gun shows. Require licensing, background checks, and wait periods. Restrict allowable places to carry. (Here's a hint, right-wingers: If you restrict guns at political conventions, you already believe restrictions work and increase safety.) Limits on the number of guns any individual can possess at one time. Repeal NRA-written laws that encourage violence. And so on. At the same time, police need to be demilitarized and have their military surplus taken back. All aspects of gun-nuttery need to be pulled back, including within law enforcement. These changes need to be federal, as the worst gun violence is made possible because guns flow from gun-happy red states to much more reasonable blue states."
Vote all the Republifuckers out of office.
I mean most mass shootings don't even involve such weapons...
Better/more background checks
"People have said that after 9/11 we didn't outlaw planes. No, we didn't, but we did make sure you had to register to fly, had to be searched before taking planes, and couldn't carry any weapons on board planes - including box cutters.

"The fact that the question only singles out 'school shootings' reveals part of the problem. As some pointed out, the fact that it took small children getting killed at school for mainstream America (dare I say 'white people') to finally even start acknowledging the daily carnage that had been going on previously says so much.  
Scores killed in weekly drive by shootings were so commonly met with 'Oh well, bad neighborhood. Get a better job and move out'.   
Good news is:  Gen Zs like  David Hogg and March For Our Lives, Moms Demand Action, Women Against Gun Violence, etc.  
Check out GVPedia.  A counter movement is slowing gaining momentum."
"Real simple, but it will never happen. Actually follow the constitution and only allow guns or military type weapons in well regulated militias. Short of that go back to what worked previously which is to ban assault weapons or turning any weapon into an assault weapon. Personally I would like to see any automatic weapon with more than 2 shots banned but again that is not going to happen. After that at least have the decency to treat a weapon meant to kill in the same category as a car. You must pass a test and have training to get a license which allows you to carry."
Make it really hard to get guns.  Every mass shoot has had easy access.
IMO- hire all these veterans to stand guard outside of schools.
"Ok, so we get rid of AR-15s. Can we keep mini 14s? Likewise, let's say we get rid of AK-47s, do we get to keep SKS's? Where's the line you draw? You say get rid of deadly weapons. All weapons are deadly, that's why they're weapons. What is it to you that makes you say specifically AR15s? Is it the caliber? Or is it the features that are on the gun? Are we allowed to have some features?

This is the problem with people screaming ""Ban the guns!"". To anyone who owns and enjoys firearms, such as myself, the ignorance with the arguments always comes out. I agree things need done, but screaming Ban guns, is only going to drive people away"

"More school resource officers that aren’t shared by multiple schools.  Consider allowing these resource officers to be armed.  One per school.  Metal detectors at one or 2 main entrances to every school.  Considering allowing teachers to be armed, but only on a voluntary basis.

Last, encourage this: If you see something, say something."
"A gun ban, like in Australia."
"Better parents and child rearing. Also, preventative measures for school buildings/staff."
Ban guns
"Removing guns is entirely out of the question at this point. There are more guns in america than people which means the potential for black market gun sales to grow in the event of a ban is astronomical. Yes we are the only country in the world with this problem to the extent we see it, but banning guns would have very little effect because theyre already out there. I completely agree with the idea of field tests and written firearm safety tests to get a license to purchase guns is 100% a good idea, but ultimately i think the main issue is definitely mental health. 

Mental healthcare in America is pathetic and laughable. You see severe depression and suicide rates within the younger generations with those numbers actively growing. If we implement better gun control laws (not a complete ban) and make a significant effort to provide mental healthcare for our citizens then maybe theres a shot at actually reducing the amount of these atrocities that are committed."
"It won't stop them but it'll help with how deadly they are, ban all semi-automatic weapons. There's no need for them anyway, anything you legitimately need a gun for can be done with a revolver, bolt/lever action rifle, or pump shotgun."
"Better security at schools. 

It’s seriously absurd that just anyone can just walk into a school. You cant go anywhere without some type of security. Offices, hospitals… basically ANY government building EXCEPT a school has security."
"I asked my friends this same question after Sandy Hook and one of them said they didn't think they could be stopped.  At this point, the train has left the station.  There's no way the government can confiscate guns that people already own.  I just looked at a bunch of varying statistics but I think it's a safe estimate to say there are about 393 million guns privately owned in the US.  Even if another gun was never made or sold, we could never reign that many in.   Even if there was some way we could magically account for and register every single one of those guns, what happens to them when the own dies?  This isn't the answer I wished for but I think this is the truth.  

Of course we need to get better at providing mental health care, and creating a culture where people don't feel marginalized to the point where shooting up a school is an option, but in reality, that's never going to happen to the degree where it creates an entire cultural shift.  I think the only thing everyday, normal people like us can do is to be kind to everyone,  including the weird loners, listen to people when they're hurting, and hope for the best."
Give every kid an AR-15. Not any younger than kindergarten however. You cant trust those 4 year olds. /s
It seems to me that making involuntary commitment easier to do would be the most effective. For so many of these cases a lot of people thought it likely that the shooter would commit the shooting before it happens.

"There should be more than ""adequate"" background checking. There should be mental health requirements. There should be longer waiting periods.

The reality is that mental health care is a super low priority in this country. It's just not that fact alone, though. Healthcare in this country is expensive for most. More and more people continue to struggle in this country because of the rising cost of living and the stagnant base pay range. People simply can't afford to live RIGHT.

Living right is living in a place with a livable wage for the WORKING CLASS. A place that provides healthcare instead of giving that money to domestic spying and proxy wars in foreign countries that line the pockets of the elite. A place that PRIORITIZES EDUCATION and uses our tax money as such.  


I could go on, but my point is that the cause of this problem is a hairy beast that we haven't even begun to tackle those issues that we are facing that contribute not just to school shootings, but the lack of care for our working class in general. We are seeing the outcome of a struggling uneducated population being fed disinformation.  


PS: Democrats are responsible for this problem as well. Fix the democratic party asap or our words, intentions, clarifications, high-roads, etc... mean nothing to the other side."
"Hold up all military spending until the weapons industry capitulates to lots of gun control. 

Anyone who says you need a 'filibuster' to win the guns issue is lying to you.

Another way has been to sue the manufacturers. 

If money is not part of the equation, no amount of 'red flag licensing laws' are going to do jack shit.

The USA dumping guns into 3rd world countries doesnt help either."
"And that cultural shift needs to be guided by actual policy, not just ""awareness campaigns"" or whatever."
"Not necessarily. There are other ways of preventing violence. For example, New Hampshire has high rates of gun ownership while also having low rates of homicide overall.

Reducing violence does not require restricting gun ownership."
It's a shame knowing that is our culture knowing that is the #1 reason for death for children.
Nah your point regarding police doesn't hold up at all.
But…the democrats are in office
"The statistics are very misleading. Most gun violence is homicides. 

Then most gun violence is with handguns. 

Of those, most are involving gangs. 

The LEAST likely person to commit a crime is some suburban dad with an AR15. Yet that’s who we target with laws. 

If we wanted to reduce gun crime, we would target gangs. But we don’t do that. We target republicans."
"Yes, over 80% of homicides are pistols and are much more of a threat due to their ease of concealment. However, how do you ban handguns and then tell woman they are not allowed to defend themselves anymore as handguns are also the most common self-defense weapon."
The back ground checks work. It's the lack of reporting to the system that's fucked up. I definitely don't have the answer but when a kid tells a therapist that he wants to shoot the school up. Or something similar he needs to be blocked from purchasing a weapon.
More guns does not equal more safety. This is born out in actual research. Please educate yourself.
">actually looking at addressing the lesser qualities of men and masculinity. 

Will you please explain this point?"
">permanent loss of gun rights for domestic violence convictions

As a bonus side-effect, this can also function as police reform."
We will need to raise YOUR taxes to do so. They won't  work for free. Remember  the cops in Texas  were worried about their own safety.
One of the most astounding things about the dialogue of gun nuts is how often they tell easily disprovable and often contradictory lies.
"With any kind of blanket ban, you are punishing millions of innocent people for the crimes of a tiny few. It's not ok."
"Question, no semi automatic weapons,

1. What about self-defense outside of a home? The most common self-defense firearm for women is a handgun. Other guns are too large and revolvers are a bad choice for self-defense for many reasons. How do we justify not allowing women to defend themselves?
2. The point of the 2nd amendment was protection against the government.  No one really argues this isn't important after what we have seen in places like venezula where firearms were taken and then mass genocide took place. It is easy to prove that an armed citizen base can stand up to a government. Large firing tanks/missiles/high collateral damage weapons would never be used against civilians as it defeats the purpose since the government is essentially destroying itself by doing this. In a revolt you see the government use primarily ground based firearm led combat which is very difficult against a large armed civilian population (look at Russia in major Ukrainian cities where soldiers have stated they cannot advance because they don't know who will shoot them). So how do we justify disarming civilians against the government?"
Capital punishment isn’t a deterrent. Period. It might be justice but that’s a different discussion.
Number one death for children?
"The statistics aren't misleading it's just people can cite true stats, while not painting the full picture. True for both sides. I don't think guns are a big problem in America when looking at total deaths that being said it is still true America's ""gun problem"" is far worse than other countries.

Also you are being disingenuous by saying targeting Republicans. That is merely a byproduct of targeting guns.

I do wonder what the stats show regarding accidental deaths from improper gun storing as I believe risk goes up dramatically by owning a gun."
"I mean do the majority of women even use handguns? Also isn't one more likely to have negative outcomes from owning a gun in general?

Aside from all that bans are impossible and would never work so not sure why anyone talks about them. At best even if passed everything already in circulation would be grandfathered in. Once the original gun ban was appealed there is no hope of reinstating such a thing imo.

I also don't get why there is a huge focus on this topic when there are more or equal deaths or suffering in other topics."
In many states anyone can buy a used AR15 with no background check in the street. It’s called the gun show exemption
such as?
"""punishing"" 

If you can't hear it, there's eye-rolling in this statement."
"1. You can still defend yourself with a revolver, you are making a bad faith argument and you know it.
2. People who think AR-15s will protect them against the government are delusional and live in a fantasy land. It will never happen, there's a reason US police have been militarized over the last 20 years. And that's not even counting the military."
In America yes. Assault rifle being #1 for type of weapon
"If they cared about stopping shootings, they’d go after gang bangers. But they target AR15 owners, which are the least likely to be involved in a shooting. 

The risk from owning a gun is from suicide not accidents. Again, adding suicides into the stats is highly misleading."
"It's wire to wire in the comment above.


There's a whole class of weapons that aren't deadly. The definition of an assault weapon is easily accessible and not hard to understand. Immediately after you claim there is no definition, you begin to complain about one of the definitions. The weapons available during the federal assault weapon ban of 1993 are not analogous to currently available AR platforms."
Actually the number one cause of death for people under the age of 18 in United States is car accidents. According to most statistical articles. Firearms and drug overdoses. Are a close second and third.  The definition of an assault rifle is nothing other than a rifle that someone commits assault with. It's not actually a type of weapon. You can take your great great grandfather's musket rifle and shoot somebody with it and it now is by definition a Assault rifle. Not trying to argue but this is why this problem isn't making progress.
There is zero chance that the number of child deaths from rifles of any sort is greater than deaths from handguns.  The second half of your statement is blatantly false.
">If they cared about stopping shootings, they’d go after gang bangers.

Not sure where you reach that conclusion as at the top of my head I know that's incorrect and have looked up the stats now to back that up:

""According to the National Gang Center, the government agency responsible for cataloging gang violence, there was an average of fewer than 2,000 gang homicides annually from 2007 to 2012. During roughly the same time period (2007 to 2011), the Federal Bureau of Investigation estimated an average of more than 15,500 homicides annually across the United States, indicating that gang-related homicides were approximately 13% total homicides annually.""

""The Bureau of Justice Statistics finds the number of gang-related homicides to be even lower. In 2008, the government agency identified 960 homicides, accounting for 6% of all homicides that year. ""

Also it's just about emotions. Most undocumented immigrants and those that cross the border are not violent nor criminals (other than breaking law of entering country and working). Plus they economically are a net benefit to USA and for the most part don't take jobs away from average American. Yet Republicans have hysteria over it nonetheless. They also don't target business owners who employ then and instead focus on individuals. Trump's wall would never stop or seriously hinder illegal immigration nor does it impact majority that over stay visas. Each side has an issue they are emotional about and solutions are not reasonable or ineffective.

>The risk from owning a gun is from suicide not accidents. Again, adding suicides into the stats is highly misleading.

That is not entirely accurate. Accidental discharges and kids getting a hold of guns are factors as well. You are also incorrect to say it's misleading due to suicides if we are talking about risk of death from owning a gun."
"Questions if you don't mind. When talking about true weapons we are talking about ""firearms"" (this excludes bb and airsoft guns wide and large as only two states actually consider them firearms). So I am in good faith asking what firearms are not deadly that should not be banned? Keep in mind non-lethal firearms used by the police like rubber bullets and beanbags are actually extremely deadly ironically enough haha.

The complaint was about the lack of definition, they just banned several parts that are not even apart of many military grade fully-automatic weapons. So what is the official definition of an assault rifle?  


I also have to strongly disagree that the weapons available during the ban and  now are not extremely similar. I have no clue who tweeted this but it is the only way I can share a viable picture haha. There are several images comparing pre and post ban weapons and as someone who knows a lot about firearms I can tell you that are almost the exact same. In fact I know many people that even before the ban would pick up the post-ban version instead because they don't like collapsible stocks or extended pistol grips. Also remember it was only illegal to sell these attached to the AR, but all ARs are interchangeable.

"In Europe, undocumented immigrants are not eligible for national healthcare systems."
"Pretty sure from your question you have little idea of how much, or how little illegal immigration there us in the USA.

However, as a true universal healthcare would be cheaper than the current US healthcare, they should be able to increase the amount of illegal immigration without affecting anything."
Considering undocumented people pay into Medicare and social security without ever being able to collect it we're doing just fine. Actually the problem we have is a lack of workers because of our broken immigration system.
Just like medicare requires an SSN.  Alaska and Hawaii already have universal healthcare and there isn't a problem.  You have been lied to about how healthcare works and immigration.
Would you rather have them use the ER? Healthcare for everyone benefits everyone.
Undocumented aliens pay 11 billion dollars on avg a year in taxes while simultaneously not being able to take advantage of social services. If you pay your taxes I see no reason why you shouldn't be able to take advantage of it.
"We have Medicaid, so if an illegal immigrant were to be stabbed on the street while they’re walking, yeah we’d take care of them. But they wouldn’t get to visit the doctor, or get dental coverage, or get most medical procedures. Just emergency stuff only"
"Got a social security number, you get universal health care."
"I can implement universal healthcare right now. All I have to do is ends the means testing for Medicaid -- boom! Everyone's automatically covered. Done.   


Yes. Yes, I can."
"When I moved to Canada, I wasn’t eligible for Ontario health insurance until I was a citizen. I had a short term policy from Blue Cross to bridge the gap."
"Is there other states that have that implemented? Because Alaska, having Cañada and being incredibly difficult to traverse through is hard for illegal immigrants to get to. Also hawaii is separated with an ocean. 

Is there other states that are in the lower 48 that could have the same success with universal healthcare (like Alaska and hawaii) but be within areas where illegal immigrants can get to?

For example, Texas, Arizona, California, ect. Would that work for these states close and accessible to the border?"
[Alaska doesn’t have universal healthcare or more then 76.2% would have a usual source of care and 11% wouldn’t go without care because of costs.](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/datacenter/alaska)
What does “means testing” mean?
Most illegal immigrants don’t walk to the US. That’s why the border wall was a waste. Most come in a car or fly.
"Mass did it decades ago.  
It is cheaper to help a population become and remain healthy than it is to just treat some illnesses and emergent issues."
"Means testing is a way of filtering potential candidates, things like how much money they have in the bank, how many assets (cars, houses, other properties, etc.) they have, how much income they have from every source, whether they have children or they are a child or are pregnant with a child. Every federal program has some sort of means testing. You could be poor, but not poor enough to qualify."
It was so freaking cold.  What a hateful and spiteful way to demonstrate your “Christian” values.
Isn’t there a certain Christmas story that goes something like this?
"I’m quite convinced if Jesus suddenly appeared and started preaching once again, he would be destroyed by Fox News as instructed by the rich who see him as a threat to their way of life.

I don't get why this isn't human trafficking.
"Somebody is paying for this to happen.

This cruel stunt was done as misdirection from problems facing the Governor of Texas such as the failing TX  power grid and its recurring blackouts. Last year they blamed the Democrats for it which was a truly crazy piece of propaganda. They brag about the TX power grid being independent all the time but it is obviously substandard and probably rife with corruption.
Texans recently re-elected this piece of shit. What are we to think of Texas?
Is anyone else just bored of the GOP cruelty? It has no shock value anymore for me. They’ve succeeded in dropping the bar I guess.

Isn’t transporting people across state lines without their permission a federal crime? Biden should federalized the Texas national guard and have Abbott arrested.

"They won’t. This is the least actual Christian and most Republican act a walking sack of shit like Abbott could make and he knows it.

I wish someone would audit him. He’s playing with federal laws and I wouldn’t be surprised if federal money wasn’t used for this stunt. In Florida people are being denied food stamps. Nothing in the federal guidelines changed. But the Governor is probably playing with their money. Just like in Tennessee.

What are they even criminalizing? Comedy shows? Wearing makeup and a dress?
My state sucks…
Nobody cared about drag shows until there was a push to include children.  Maybe that wasn’t a good hill to die on.

WTF I'm paying about 28% tax rate on my working class income."

2018   $999,466

Wasn't 2020 during his presidency?
"Broke billionaire becomes President. Profits off the highest office, barely pays taxes. Stages failed coup after losing election. Becomes broke again after leaving, stealing on his way out. Wants to suspend constitution so he can be President again to profit from the office. What happens next in this story?"
"That's not bad compared to some. That pay zero every year.

Edit: difference between a hot turd and a cold turd. It's still a turd"
If he hadn’t been such an idiot about releasing his returns this would be mostly a non-story.
Trump must've just forgotten about the money he grifted that year. He was too busy paying off porn stars to remember.
Easier to cheat when you aren’t being watched.
I'm not getting this one very well.   Do people think he cheated on his taxes?   Is he under IRS investigation?   (I'm asking seriously.....I try my best to not pay attention to Trump.)
But he claimed 5.5million refund the year he paid nothing. Didn't he?
That just means we’re not smrt like he is
"Tax year 2020, due April 2021."
Shoots someone on 5th Ave...gets away w/ it.
"His children & children-in-law made millions, maybe billions"
"Yeah, the fact he paid anything at all will be exonerating for him to the right wing and many in the middle"
I'm still waiting for the smoke and mirrors type of thing. As in why did he drag this out?
"He went through a ton of effort to not release them, when all other candidates do voluntarily. He even made up stories about not being able to release them because he was being audited (he could still release them and wasn't being audited).

It made people wonder why he was working so hard to keep them hidden. The usual guesses were that it showed he wasn't as rich as he claimed, didn't pay much in taxes, maybe cheated on them, or it showed income from a source he wouldn't want to be public."
"It has been claimed by many that he had been cheating on his taxes since he first announced his intention to run for the presidency, but his use of the courts to block probes has allowed him to keep claiming it is a baseless accusation. Lately, his attempts at legally suppressing the truth are becoming increasingly feeble and many allegations are proving true. This story in particular is pretty huge news all by itself. Whether he will face justice remains to be seen. It will likely be a year at minimum before his other criminal charges could be put to trial."
"He’s not smart, at all 😂"
Taxpayers
"Right... So during his presidency (tax year 2020) he also paid $0 in taxes, according to the title"
Trump made more money overcharging the Secret Service for golf carts than a lot of Americans make in a lifetime.
"Lol yes, Because those all on the left don't use loophes eithe

Edit, wasn't that one of trumps things anyway , said its corrupt n he knows kuz he'd using it? Change the law not peoples personality"
There is probably something REALLY illegal in there that will take some sleuthing to figure out.. once the internet gets ahold of it we will find out tho.
He dragged it out because he's a criminal and this is what criminals do.
"Um, excuse you. Everyone knows that the J In Donald J trump stands for “jenuis”"
Reread. From what I'm gathering these taxes are paid the year *after*. He paid $0 in 2021 for his 2020 taxes
"Breaking the law isn’t a personality trait, it just means your a criminal. If he’s committing tax fraud (he is) he should go to prison for it. If there are people on the left (or right, or middle) who are committing tax fraud, they should go to prison for it. This isn’t hard."
😂
Gotta add /s to your post next time cuz there really are too many slow mfs out there nowadays 😂
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't more concerned with Billionaires get a 5.4 million dollar refund. Are you trying to move the goal post? Cause while I may be less concerned it doesn't mean I'm not concerned at all.
Money well spent. No issues from me.
Genuinely curious
"It’s not legal to under value your assets deliberately and then claim losses ya ding dong. That’s what he does and that’s the problem. Nothing is illegal unless you get caught. Trump Org was already found guilty of tax fraud once this year. When the dirt is pulled out of these obviously fraudulent filings hopefully he is also found guilty of the tax fraud that he has committed.

Edit - spelling

Edit 2 - Also, the fact that the IRS just “chose” not to conduct a tax audit on him like they do for every other President just reaks of shenanigans. Smells like another “well all the evidence is there, but there’s no legal mechanism for charging a sitting President with anything so oh well I guess”…just like every other investigation into him while he was President."
🤣🤣
"Would I vote for a candidate with only ONE issue on their platform?

No. Never."
"A candidate with this platform would get absolutely destroyed. ""I'm not going to talk about issues until money is out of politics"" is a ridiculously dumb stance."
Sure
I complete agree with removing  money from politics beyond what citizens can spend but the GOP Supreme Court has ruled money is speech and you are not able to do as you suggest. It is also extreme enough to not work. In fact most of what you are suggesting is too extreme to ever happen.  I am far left wing libertarian for what it matters.
"no, only voting on one topic is never good, and saying its treason means you dont know how its defined"
"Age, and disinvestment options are losers.   Dark Money and accountability should be main focus."

"My big issues, in order, are:
Preserving democracy

TRUE universal healthcare. Obamacare isn't it.

Expanding Social Security 

Workers'/union rights/repealing Citizens United 

Increasing military pay while DRASTICALLY reducing weapons procurement (veteran here)

I have never been a single-issue voter."
"If you could guarantee you could do this, sure, but a single candidate could never do this on their own. 

Technically all the things you are trying to fix have come from one side of the aisle, Republicans/conservatives. 

Democrats have tried to counter and introduce these types of checks and balances over the years but they always get shot down by Republicans."
"Do you know what liquidate assets means? It means to sell them and have the value as cash. And given your limit, that would include the homes of most people who would run for office."
"Exactly. If a candidate can’t get behind a whole platform of issues I’d have no interest in them even if it was important. 

Let me guess that Conservatives would be happy to use one issue to decide. Usually the issue the right wing media tells them."
"Why not?  In defense, this ""one issue"" is what corrupts any legislation on any of the other issues you might bring up."
"Strange comment for a true liberal, if the pros of this leads to a more fair system that could more easily give you things you want and outweigh the cons. Then why could you never vote for it as a single issue?"
"So even if it’s a goal if “I’m going to propose these measures that literally only affect and limit politicians ability to be corrupt so we can expose who’s working for us and who’s working for themselves” platform, you wouldn’t give four years to do chemo on the cancer that is corruption in our system?  Or at least to do the x-ray to expose the disease?"
"[Dictionary.com](https://Dictionary.com).  

Treason:  

\-the offense of acting to overthrow one's government or to harm or kill its sovereign.  
\-a violation of allegiance to one's sovereign or to one's state.  
\-**the betrayal of a trust or confidence; breach of faith; treachery.**

I know the definition and stand by using that term if a politician takes money from an interested party in regards to how they legislate."
Correct
Because that’s an over simplification of the problem and because a president can never only govern on one issue so I need to know more
"Because there are a thousand reasons that may not be true. A “true” liberal is one who is fundamentally concerned with advancing human freedom. 

Donald Trump was a candidate that was able to advance his politics without support from the money machine.

The whole idea of this post is “ignore everything else and focus on getting money out of politics instead” 

But in literally recent years we have seen how that’s not even close to enough."
"Suggesting the humans should stop driving cars and fly instead by growing wings is not a realistic proposition. What is offered must be attainable or it is a waste of time and attention. Elizabeth Warren has some excellent bills that have not gotten passed. She needs more progressives elected and for the MSM to educate people on how they would work and encourage people to hound their representatives to support her. I am not interested in pissing in the wind. Yes we need to undo Citizens  United, to expand our Supreme Court, to elect people who don't just serve the 1%. We need to do a great many things but that is not going to happen as long as the American people keep flopping back and forth preventing either party from delivering or accomplishing more that the bare minimum. Historically the economy and human rights do better under Democrats but they are blocked every 2 years. Decades ago they tried to deal with climate change, immigration reform and other national interests. They keep getting slapped down for it so back away.  After 50 years of watching this I have little hope for real progress. Americans are who they are."

"So they have very fat bank accounts from having sold everything including their family homes, and the families are living in hotels while they run for office?"
"You have no idea what you are talking about....

First of all Trump already had millions of dollars to spend on his campaign. Very few people have access to that kind of wealth. 

On top of that he rode on the billions of dollars the Republican machine had spent including money spent messaging against Democrats....

""Trump rode to victory on more than $5 billion in “free” television on news programs that provided wall-to-wall coverage of his every word, according to data analytics firm mediaQuant.""

If you think Donald Trump represents a candidate that was successful for not spending much money to win an election as proof against the provided hypothetical, you are delusional."
Sorry. This hypothetical is assuming an average citizen runs on the platform. Not an already filthy rich person.
"What does the media have to do with this issue?

You’re clearly not grasping my point. We can ban unlimited donations. We can’t ban someone from using their own money."

Idk I mean I consider myself to be mostly left leaning but when it comes to the trans conversation...idc what adults do to their bodies and yes they should have equal rights but don't expect me to not think it's fucking weird.
It's because all of the right wing talking points and outrage are directly influenced by Russian propaganda.
This is on trump. He gets the most applause from his braindead masses when he mentions pronouns or gender affirming surgery. He is a POS.
"The far right is having a hard time finding their underdogs to pick on these days. 

Cultural rhetoric picked up and did away with being able to continue being openly bigoted 

80s-African Americans. Civil rights wasn't really over, but mainstreaming AA culture to America through television and the first real generation of post civil rights kids, being bigoted against blacks turned into a very bad thing.

90s- Women- sexism and open misogynism really started to gain attention. Clarence Thomas and sexual exploitation of women in and out of the workplace started to move equal rights for women into the mainstream. Women who had careers were starting to be seen as normal, not mannish. 

00's - Middle East- the beginning of the 00's had open bigotry and hate towards anyone from that region of the world out and in style based on political manipulation of 9/11. It took over a decade of that for people to start learning a little more about the region. Still a easy target though, but these days our culture at least pretends to be more sensitive to Muslims. 

10's- Homosexuals finally got rights to marry and be miserable too. The F word went completely out of usage. Try as they might, the right just couldn't stop the overwhelming support for LGB equality, or at least way more than had been in prior decades. 

Where else do you find a group of people that are easy to pick on, often misunderstood, and not part of a major group of influence in the US? Trans! The Christian fascists can so easily manipulate the public's perception of transgendered and transexual people- and they're a small group, no money, power or influence, and can't fight back. 

It is honestly the most one-sided, pitiful abuse of cultural influence I've ever seen."
Why is it always Russian propaganda when it is something left leaning people disagree with?
Left leaning people disagree with hating other people for their sexuality. Right leaning people hate anyone who isn’t right wing. It’s Russian propaganda because it’s exactly the view point of Russian propagandists. Literally everything being spewed out of the Trump caucus are the exact same talking points you see on Russian TV. Stop watching Tucker Carlson.
See still not true. Right wing people don't just hate people who aren't right wing. They usually just dislike ideas that they disagree with. Even me a gay right leaning person still disagrees with people on the left and right because I don't agree with everything that is said by either side. But sure if you want to live in a world where the US is the good guy and the Democratic party is the saviors of the world go ahead. But you are delusional and should broaden your horizon and learn a little more. Nothing wrong with watching a balance of news outlets from CNN to Fox News at least this way you will know what the other side is thinking.
"That’s not at all how I think, good try though!"
They will fall in line soon enough. They don’t have an original thought in their brains. They are just awaiting orders from their senior diaper daddy.

"Put another way, “Majority of Republican Senators do support murdering their political enemies to usurp power from them.”"
"Having failed to protect the republic by eliminating a clearly unqualified tax cheat from the candidate pool, the GOP is now cynically standing by while ACTUAL PATRIOTIC AMERICANS take on the work of making sure that Donald Trump's crimes are fully exposed and he can never be a viable candidate again.  
More wimpy-ness from folks who ought to know better.  


Two lessons...1) Learn and measure all future political candidate choices against the [www.principlesofdemocracy.org](https://www.principlesofdemocracy.org) and 2) Never let your apathy for the choices keep you from voting! There's always a better choice of the two...and without your vote for the better one, the worser choice has a bigger shot. 

HRC's winning and inauguration would probably have only added $2T to the debt rather than Trump's $8.6T, saved 700K Americans from death by COVID - Hillary would not have deconstructed Obama's pandemic framework and listened to the science - USA matching Canada's deaths per million would yield 700K fewer deaths - and certainly there would have been no attempted coup if Hillary lost her bid for re-election.  
   
I'd have taken headlines of ""Bill Caught Boinking Interns Again!"" any day of the week over one more 'achievement' by Trump and Co."
Trump has never once won a popular vote but has lost a lot of campaigns for others. His cult may be large but not large enough to overcome the base of rational people.
"aren't protecting him, yet..."
Senior diaper baby... Biden.
Trump has never once won a popular vote but has lost a lot of campaigns for others. His cult may be large but not large enough to overcome the base of rational people.
"I think it is more like they are seeing which way the primary season goes. If Trump looks to be the nominee, they will start kissing his ass again."
"I think they're getting more confident they can cut him loose like some of them wanted to do in 2016. If they can, and try to get back to their more traditional forms of power retention with leaders who don't say the quiet part out loud and they can just collect money with less drama, they absolutely will go for that. 

My opinion is that almost nobody truly loyal to Trump has any governmental power. Everyone near him that's actually got political power are fine with him as long as he is good for them, nothing more, nothing less. I think all his true followers and real admirers are just people on the outside of the systems."
"It's more because they aren't forced to support him without risking their voters voting for trump nominees instead. Most republicans wanted to get rid of Trump for a long time, but it's difficult to do so when he's the face of the party, but now that he isn't and has low approval ota finally possible to do so. Trump was a virus for the Republican party and the Republican party knew, which is why some would even support him publicly while donating to rivals at the same time."
"Not surprising. Anytime you vote to impeach your own Party, you're putting yourself at risk."
More like they won’t speak up about it because it isn’t politically useful for them
"Yes - No one (re: his base) wants to talk about that, do they?"
"The __demagogic temerity__ of pugnacious, narcissistic, and want-to-be fascist dictator / defeated grifter and one term former President Trump (76 years old, born 16 June 1946) is __the only president to be impeached twice)__ and the imbroglio he has foisted upon our country *knows no bounds.* Guilty __(at the very least)__ of extreme direlection of duty, his cognitive dissonance has moved forward unchecked for far too long.

I can't wait for the worst president that the US has __ever had__ to face charges for all of his criminality.

About time.

Edit - Added birthdate and age."
All they had to do was start calling him out on fox entertainment and he would have been done
Some did. It didn't go too well for them.
"Which goes back to my original post, it's only bc he got caught and now they're calling him out"
Opposing the Party line is always a bad move when dealing with a political mouthpiece network.
"It's not because he got caught per se, it's because he's in a vulnerable enough position that makes ditching him not a political suicide anymore. They wanted to ditch him earlier but couldn't, now they can because he got caught, but they would have been happy to do it way before then, it just wasn't feasible without losing support from your voters and giving them to the candidates closest to Trump. It's game theory, basically."
"New SC precedent.  Executive orders we like can not expire, executive orders we don’t like are not allowed."
So the Supreme Court is making executive orders now?

This is absolutely unacceptable that they can do this. This is not a function of their position."
"SCOTUS: We believe in interpretation of the constitution as it was originally intended 

Also SCOTUS: We make policy decisions now"
So they legislate now?
"SCOTUS acting in a near unlawful way is just the latest failing in a broken government. Congress had months to try to figure something out but I’m sure the house GOP wouldn’t help and I’m sure Sinnema would be a stick in the mud. 

So nothing gets done. 

Biden probably is disgusted congress does nothing because I do feel the migrant issue IS getting worse but Biden isn’t going to just extend a policy he and his party have been vocally against. 

Just a giant mess

So with a broken Congress and a White House really stuck right now with a no win scenario? I can make a rational argument for why SCOTUS felt it bad to step in"
"So special interest lawyers and a judge are allowed to make executive orders now…and they get to tell the president what he can do? Rad. 

“EL PASO, Texas – The pandemic border restrictions known as Title 42 will continue, at least for now, after the U.S. Supreme court has granted an 11th-hour request by a group of Republican attorneys general from 19 states seeking to extend those restrictions.

In an order signed by Justice John Roberts, the court asked for a response from the Biden administration by 5 p.m. eastern time Tuesday.”"
Ok. Pack the fucking court. No slippery slope argument is worth this bullshit.
Why would anyone willingly want tax evading illegals that dont contribute to society to keep entering the country? /s
"If it helps. States go to the Supreme Court when litigation is underway. It’s a checks and balances system. Else any person in office can do anything they want and no need to congress or senate…Google’d a bit

“Facing the termination of the policy on Wednesday under Sullivan’s order, the states asked the justices to step in on an emergency basis and block that order from taking effect, which would effectively keep the Title 42 policy in place while litigation continues. If Sullivan’s order is allowed to stand, they argued, it “will hamstring emergency action by CDC to prevent aliens with communicable diseases from entering the United States in the future.”

So means no more Covid testing, and cases are starting to go up again, I assume due to flu season. Since it’s a U.S. Law and they need to enforce it and as the article said litigation is underway then I’d expect it to stand until litigation is over. Not that it matters, the boarder is exploding with undocumented people and then of course the fentanyl flood. I’m floored anybody wants to be a boarder agent, I know one guy in Texas and the stories I hear are horrific."
"This is just another ""We are keeping the status quo to give time for us to be fully briefed so we can make an actual decision"" kind of incident. It's common."
"I don't know why Republicans are against immigration. 

Immigrants:

- Tend to have conservative values. 

- Put downward pressure on wages by increasing the supply of labor. Additionally, many immigrants are willing to work for less, undercutting domestic rates. 

What's the deal, Republicans?"
And taking over the President’s right to control immigration?
Pretty much since the start.
"It’s always been like this, since Marbury v Madison in the 1800s."

"A few years ago I found a government site that showed the list from every police force in America. And you could look up what equipment they purchased. 
My town of like 25k people or something so much military war equipment it blew my mind. And it was not cheap. 
It utterly dwarfed what anyone could legally, ever ever buy in the state. 
Oh and we don't even have violent crime problems, social dissent, or uproar whatsoever. No threats made by the people until covid with mask mandates, iro iCarly the people against masks bame themselves red shirts( star trek anyone?) And even threatened city council, mayor, and police chief over it. Goddamn idiots. 
The redder the state has become, majority wise, the more fervent the people have been I have noticed.
But really it's just a very peaceful place. Our police force has been buying military, weapons of war. Every year for longer than I checked, which I went back to like 2008 or something. 
At least if there is a zombie apocalypse I know I can find a huge arsenal, but dealing with the red hats is a bigger problem than zombies. I AM NOT IMPLYING ANY VIOLENCE TOWARDS RED HATS. It was only said to emphasize their threat level. 
Groups of white nationalists and neo nazis started meeting up in like 2018. Like making a fascist festival out of it. It is utterly insane. 
However they're never seemed to be a threat of anything before Trump took office. I think in the 90s college kids had a ""riot"" on the edge of town and knocked over a street lamp, that being the worst. 
During blm we had white nationalists show up and somehow get onto the roofs of all the buildings downtown where the March was, they were all armed with ar15s or so ething similar. White nationalists graffiti popped up before and during the blm protest, which was simply just a March we went on that we petitioned for and worked with the police and the community to do. People were on the ground with masks and red hats with their guns out like they though people were gonna what? Ruin their parents stores???? 
Pure insanity. 
But I digress. 
The cops here don't need to have fully auto firearms or explosives and shit. Just train them a little bit and they will already be more efficient than 95% of the psycho far righties here. 
However I will say that my town has a problem with corruption for sure. Takes a little bit to see it but it's flagrant."

"to assume they should be moral is weird to me. morals change based on culture and time. the whole point of the supreme court is to interpret the constitution. a document that was written by a majority of (by todays standards) immoral people.

While i would agree they are not doing this in good faith since Trumps picks, I would argue that its more on congress to change the constitution to be a more ""moral"" that the supreme court has to abide by."
You've identified a problem. What is your proposed solution?
And corrupt
It’s a shadow cult.
We could start by expanding the court to have one justice for each federal district but that is a short term solution. The problem is the Federalist society itself and how it has corrupted the highest court in our nation. Justices can be impeached but that will not happen in the America that exists at this point in time. I have no idea how to fix this. And you?
"impeach four of the justices, or other forms of removal."

So what's the point of this post? Conspiracy theory nonsense?
Saudis financing 9/11 is no conspiracy theory. It's fact.
"How are you and OP phrasing it? Saudis as a collective or as a country. There is no proof Saudi Arabia as a country or a whole funded 9/11. There is only evidence of individual actors. Saudi Arabia even kicked Osama bin laden out of the country.

OP is also trying to insinuate something nefarious just by investors being from Saudi Arabia. What would you call someone who proclaimed the same if it were an individual from Israel who was an investor..."

Mitt Romney, who notably refused to indorse Lee’s re-election campaign.

When they let black kids in with low scores, they fail out at astonishing rates.  When they got rid of affirmative action, black kids went to schools they were qualified for and their graduation rates went way up.  AA isn't doing the minorities it targets any favors.

"I still see this in corporate America. People of color that have Ivy League educations are often fast tracked as diversity plays while:

- wealthy white people with connections and Ivy League educations continue to move into the upper ranks easily

- standard white guys from poorer backgrounds are considered the majority and get left back

At a macro level, this is a factor that allows for the radicalization of poor white people. It was explicitly one of the facets of the Southern Strategy which flipped white southerners from Democrat to Republican."
I agree with this.

"College should be a meritocracy. While this favors cultures that put emphasis on education - Asians, Jews, etc., there's nothing wrong with that. Nothing precludes any child from focusing on these things.

"But it doesn’t. It may reflect racial diversity, but it ignores diversity of wealth/non-wealth backgrounds - which is actually a much more statistically valid indicator of financial success (compared to race). 

Republicans actually call this one right - though they want to abolish equality programs altogether and I’d like to see them fixed to focus on socioeconomic background."
The issue for the Ivey leagues is that they have a lot of international students. Americans are at a disadvantage in those schools.
"Agreed. The term ""systemic racism/bigotry"" exists for a reason. Until everyone is aware that unconscious biases exist and work to ensure these biases are not indulged, we have to have some sort of mechanism for equity."
Replacing bias with even more subjective bias is a recipe for disaster.
"The leg up given to those generations led to inequality in each subsequent generation.

People who were allowed to accumulate wealth, and earn more because they were able to get an education, were in a better position to pass on wealth and help ensure the next generation got an education and started businesses with that accumulated wealth. E.g., Apple and Microsoft both exist because of loans from parents."
"I agree. My statement above also holds for economic diversity as well. And using the standard of economic diversity may be the only way to ensure ethnic diversity give the current political realities. Regardless, racism is still a factor that inhibits the equal opportunity for all which are right enshrined in the preamble of the Declaration of Independence and introduction of the Constitution."
"I haven't heard any ( that I remember) that want to remove all entirely, most do focus on the racial aspect which is what i feel most people i meet agree with, left or right

The biggest problem with AA is it implies everyone is still racist and would only hire/ educate white people, wich I think is a very negative and incorrect view in the world,  MAYBE (more than probably ) it was necessary early days in certain areas as prejudice doesn't dissappear over night especially when It was legal to do so and socially encouraged like America 

But anyone who agrees with it still to this day ask yourself , do you know any  teachers ? Principals ? Managers ? Are they racist people who would not hire someone based on their race ? If no, why assume others are"

"Generational wealth only lasts so long,  and everyone has the same opportunity now so whether my grandad was rich  at some point in time  shouldn't automatically assume that i in public school have an advantage or that wealth came from oppression maybe he grew leeks , it's quite a ridiculous thought especially if u take into account just as many white families struggle too"
"You should never try to correct for past biases by imposing new biases on other people who were never involved in the first place, that in itself is blatantly unfair. 

At no point in my argument did I say people who need support shouldn't get it. So, that's projection on your part 

You absolutely can black-box bias from a system of evaluation by removing any knowledge of the applicant and judging them entirely based on the data provided with no other context of who they are. It's not hard to do at all. This approach is done everyday in science experiments. In fact it is the foundation of science to be able to remove bias from evaluating data. To say it can't be done is to say there's no such thing as science, which we know isn't true."

Suburbs after WW2 were off limits to dark people, and that's where home values increased the most.

And those people were allowed to work in exchange for pay, which they used to accumulate wealth over their lifetimes. And they passed their excess wealth to subsequent generations. 

Meanwhile, my island-dwelling ancestors were forced to exchange that island's natural resources, including actual humans, for the arcane knowledge of ""bureaucracy."" That knowledge still plagues them today.

"The __demagogic temerity__ of pugnacious, narcissistic, and want-to-be fascist dictator / defeated grifter and one term former President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice)__ and the imbroglio he has foisted upon our country *knows no bounds.* Guilty __(at the very least) of extreme direlection of duty, his cognitive dissonance __moves forward unchecked.__

>*A group of 40 House Democrats, led by Rep. David Cicilline (R.I.), introduced legislation on Thursday to bar former President Trump from holding future federal office under the 14th Amendment. Section 3 of the amendment states that no one who previously took an oath to support the Constitution and engaged in “insurrection or rebellion” shall “hold any office, civil or military, under the United States.”*

Wouldn't it be wonderful if they could get this passed before the new Congress is sworn in?  The chances of that happening are pretty slim, but it sure is nice to think about.

It's interesting to note that a __criminal conviction is not necessary__ for someone to be disqualified.

>*One point of agreement, including by the judge in Greene’s case, seems to be that a criminal conviction is not required for an individual to be disqualified by Section 3.*

It's as clear as the nose on anyone's face that one term twice impeached former President Trump tried to destroy America. He is still trying to do so - to this very day.

>*Cicilline said in a release announcing the legislation that Trump “very clearly” engaged in an insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021, with the intention of overturning the results of the 2020 presidential election. ""You don’t get to lead a government you tried to destroy,” he said. The bill also specifically describes how Trump helped encourage the violence on Jan. 6, tried to intimidate state and federal officials when they did not support his false claims of the election being stolen and refused to denounce the mob that stormed the Capitol for hours during the riot. ""The 14th Amendment makes clear that based on his past behavior, Donald Trump is disqualified from ever holding federal office again and, under Section 5, Congress has the power to pass legislation to implement this prohibition,” Cicilline said.*

I don't know if they have enough time to get this bill sent to the Senate? But let's hope so.

"According to the law and the US Constitution, as it currently stands?

No. 

The use of the word “insurrection” to describe the 6 January 2021 explosive destruction that took place towards our U.S. Capitol __isn’t just a word.__ It clarifies explicit constitutional consequences and effects. Serious enough to be detailed in our US Constitution. 

>*Section 3 of the 14th Amendment prohibits the election or appointment of an individual to state or federal office if they previously held such an office, took an oath of office and then “engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the [United States], or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.” Adopted after the Civil War, the amendment precludes any insurrectionist who has served as a member of Congress, state legislator, U.S. military officer or federal or state officer from serving again.*

Honestly? 

That __sounds exactly like__ what one term twice impeached former President Trump did. __He does not need to be convicted__ in order for *Section 3 to be implemented.*

>*One point of agreement, including by the judge in Greene’s case, seems to be that a criminal conviction is not required for an individual to be disqualified by Section 3.*

Edit - Added highlights. Fixed voice to text issues. Wrote a section about the US Constitution consequences."
Bad faith politics. Ill-advised.
"Thats the crazy part.

Yes, you can run for president from prison."
"I wont believe any of their candidates will be fucked until the election is over. We said that in 2016, never again.

The only good the orange dingleberry and florida man can do for America is to rip the republican party in half. Hell maybe liz can split it into 3. Either way, fracturing the conservative vote so they dont know who to ""fall in line"" behind is they only way to end this cancer on our country. The two party system is downright awful and only hasn't been abandoned because its a game of chicken, first party to split wont have the voters to win for a long time, so lets let the republicans do it involuntarily, out of a petty narcissist's spite."
Trump still holds a quite large amount of support from Republican voters. Having both run will absolutely split the vote.
"For sure, I'm saying that I want him to run to ensure a victory for Democrats. Democrats seem to be aiming to shot themselves in the foot as is tradition."
"Eugene Debs ran from prison, his campaign slogan was Convict No. 9653 For President."
Is that to ensure locking up a political opponent won’t stop democracy? Or is this one of those fun things we didn’t think to codify?
Oh by far I agree. We are gonna have to vote blue like hell to keep these bastards out regardless. But I know with Trump's narcissism he will not back down if Desantis wins the nomination and neither one will reach the necessary amount to win the presidency. But here's hoping this will lead to the Republican parties downfall and we can eventually have much better 3rd party candidates. I'd prefer to vote green party but I do not feel even close to safe doing that yet. Here's hoping for a future where we can make that decision.
"If the GOP splits, the Overton window will have a chance to move waaaaaay left.  We would have Christian nationalist nutjobs, ""fiscally conservative, socially liberal"" moderate conservatives, and (hopefully) some actual socal democrats who can start passing legislature that matches with every other developed country on earth. At least I hope this happens."
"Yes. We all know that. And that's a good thing for America and the world (re: no chance he will win).

But it's embarrassing if that's the best that the Republicans can do.

Truly.

Edit - Spell check. Added parenthesis."
Probably do you can't lock someone up to stop them from running.  I think having a felony stops someone from running for senate or the house though.
"Exactly. In any other country AOC and Biden would be in 2 different parties. I'd join up with a progressive party in a heartbeat if it wouldn't spoil the results. 

Who knows this may be the single good thing this moron ever does in his lifetime, albeit unintentionally"
I missed this story somehow.  I think I was distracted looking at my Obama trading cards…oh wait…we are not a cult.
What was the announcing?
Sound and fury signifying nothing.
"One term twice impeached former President Trump has decided (in addition to his just released NFT trading cards) that he will fight the left-wing regime for free speech (paraphrasing here) for everyone.

>*Now that we’re all done (or not) laughing over Trump’s collection of NFT trading cards, let’s turn to a second announcement he made on Thursday: a deeply concerning promise to “shatter the left-wing censorship regime and to reclaim the right to free speech for all Americans.”*

When one term twice impeached former President Trump was in office? That is not the way he acted, nor is it the way he treated people who may have had different philosophies than he had.

It seems to me that his primary goal in life is to plant anger and hatred in the hearts and minds of everyone who hears his voice.

>*“In recent weeks, bombshell reports have confirmed that a sinister group of derp-state bureaucrats, Silicon Valley tyrants, left-wing activists, and depraved corporate news media have been conspiring to manipulate and silence the American people,” Trump said in the video.*

Is this his plan in order to have another insurrection? Why does that not surprise me?

Pugnacious want-to-be dictator and defeated one term former President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice)__ incited an insurrection, tried to destroy our democracy and our US Constitution. He has made it clear that his intentions to continue with this mindset are still at the top of his mind.

Everyone should think about that - every single day. From now until election day."
Did Trump use the ridiculous NFT cards as a smokescreen so that only his base would see this insanity?
"Good, if nobody hears his message, then it's just the blunders of a lunatic. We can stay focused on Elon who actually has the power to silence people, and keep fighting that mad man now."
This is terrible.
"They know that if they say there is evidence and link to something people will just assume there is.

Nothing released really shows any of that censorship. If anything it looks like twitter was going easy on him."
"I'm still trying to find a CharizObama card, those are so rare!"
I'll admit I *do* have my Obama comic books that came out during his first run...
"He thinks his major announcement was the ability to pay $99 per Trump Card so that people can have a picture of him.

They reflect how he sees himself - not how he appears in reality.

Also? He doesn't think that free speech is getting the support that it needs, in his opinion.

Translation?

There are not enough platforms in America supporting his white supremest and other belief systems.

And he's going to change that, by golly."
"lol

His base does not seem to care, but that did make me laugh out loud. I had to let you know"
"One term twice impeached former President Trump raised so much money. 

That is what he really wanted to do - to grift the American public - his loyal base - a little bit more. 

It's really shameful. And embarrassing.

I've been so upset with everything going on with the Twitter situation? I actually left Twitter."
Still trying to get my hands on that shiny holographic foil dark brandon

Interesting angle.. and  knowing  him.. the most likely scenario.
How do you sell out of a jpeg?
I honestly don’t believe it.  Has anyone tracked the NFT minting on ETH?
"If people are stupid enough to buy them, then good for Trump, the guy certainly knows how to exploit his followers."
I think it's more likely that Trump and his associates bought them to create an image of demand so that when they come back more people will buy in thinking it's an in demand product.
$99 for a fucking pdf. As if the tangerine tumor needs more money.
No idea. NFT's are ridiculous anyway.
"That's the problem.  NFTs don't technically exist any more than the money in your Swiss account.  The smart way to do it is to mark an item as limited production, allowing you to jack up the unit price because it's ""rare""."
"They are limited editions, basically you are buying the ""seal of authenticity"" not the actual image itself.  So you essentially bought a unique set of numbers, and digits.  Its more crypto bro shenanigans, basically printing their own money.  Also supposedly some of the art for these were stolen, so ya its about as pathetic as you'd expect."
I was wondering the same thing. Manufactured scarcity maybe? I guess one could place any “limited number” amount they want on them. You simply quit selling them when that number is reached. It’s still stupid though.
Putin and other Russians.
This is actually an interesting idea.  Buy your own NFT’s to launder your dirty money.
What flop? He got their money; sold them another Big Lie.
"The ambiguous notion of “Trump’s sense of humor” has always eluded me. I’ve never been able to really figure it out. He has made remarks in the past that seem like they MIGHT be the faintest whiff of self awareness; but then he soon after goes right back into his usual narcissistic rhetoric that has absolutely zero self-awareness at all. Every once in a blue moon, he’ll say something that’s just almost self-deprecating, but not quite. He doesn’t seem smart enough to fully play into the absurd cartoon character that he has become. It’s all so very, very strange."
"MAGA have a really unrefined sense of humor. While there are obviously intelligent Republicans out there, this specific breed of conservative tends to rely on heavy handed jokes, that leave nothing for the imagination, because it doesn’t trust its audience to be smart enough to get the jape. That’s why they thought Let’s Go Brandon was so clever and going to get under Democrat’s skin, and it just left most of us confused because it’s so weirdly obvious and not at all insulting, like…what are we missing, what’s the subtext. And there just is never any."
"I'm still waiting for something nefarious to be revealed about this stunt.  Aside from the possibilities of laundering money and foreign investment - - I had the highly paranoid (it's not paranoia if they're actually out to get you, and Trump's GOP is certainly that) idea that it was a deep fake that Trump (his wranglers and owners, rather) personally oversaw the creation of - in order to reveal that it could be done and get a lot of attention, and further erode the trust and sense of his followers as the media increasingly covers his downfall and criminality.  It has 'chaos investment' written all over it, if seen through this (granted - probably just paranoid) lens."
They don’t seem to understand who he’s laughing at.

My hate for DJT runs very deep and he will get away with everything. So, I’d rather him be gone for good. (Unless he’s financially ruined and loses everything. Mara Lago, his jet, all his golf courses, his wife, all cars and is forced to live in a shithole one bedroom apartment with a 20 year old Hyundai.

It’s literally been in the platforms for several major Presidential Candidates, Rick Perry is the one who springs to mind most readily.

"Look up the political compass, Libertarians are for the right of the people, authoritarians are for their rights."
Why are you here?
"""How to privatize education? How could that work?""

It's pretty simple. There are private schools all over the country. Many of them charge lots of money for kids to attend. They can teach (or not) whatever they want, with little government control. Conservatives want to avoid government control which could require them to teach facts like evolution theory and the history of slavery, while prohibiting teaching straight from the bible. Liberals want kids to learn real science and facts. Liberals also want all kids to get a good education at a cost that everyone can afford. Public schools have, in the past, provided access to a quality education paid for by taxes, and available to all.

The right wing wants to end public education so they can teach flat earth and bible. They prefer to discriminate between races and gender and wealth in deciding which kids get a decent education. And they want the rich to profit from running schools, partly to justify elimination of Boards of Education."
Sweet summer child. That’s adorable.
"This is incoherent.

Left in America equals hands off government on social issues, government provides help economically.

"You can't profit from schools you have no control over either, if the only education option was St. Mary's, that's a private school, Republicans couldn't do anything.."
":/ Yeah.. I think I'm a Republican now, thanks."
"I think that the incoherence is in the mainstream conception of ""left"" and ""right"" as a political spectrum."
"Nobody will change your mind, we both know that.

Why did you come here?"
"State schools are only able to operate because of the massive amounts of money they get from the federal government. If the federal government stopped giving states money for education, the state would have to make up that money themselves (through higher taxes) or shut down schools. I guarantee you any state constitution written to require funding public education will get an amendment ending that requirement the day federal funding stops."
"Republicans wouldn't NEED to do anything because the private schools would be teaching exactly what they want them to, Christianity based education. 
And the people who own and operate these schools are rich Republican donors. Just like jails. That's why Republicans are always looking for ways to push more people into private schools and private prisons, because they're profitable."
Kansas is resilient!! >:] 🌻
"I think you're kinda right, but kinda not. I feel like the most patriotic states would probably continue public education..

I guarantee at least 50 states would sue the federal government before resorting to state funding"
":/ Then there's the fact that there's also non-religious private schools. Why go St. Mary's when I can go to Labette County Highschool.. 
Private schools treat their students better from what I've seen, religious or not.. 
But that's ofc not what Republicans care about, as I've been belittled for being 'too young' by them, however caring about what young adults need or want is very unfocused upon by almost everyone.. 

:/ A lot of radical Republicans, I can agree think religion should be taught in schools.. but we'll never ever get to that point, that would be unconstitutional (first amendment) 

Many, like Marjorie Taylor Greene definitely want that, but as far as the majority of the GOP, Kelly Armstrong, Don Bacon 🥓, Anthony Gonzalez, and '_' maybe Trump himself definitely don't seem like the type..

Trump doesn't understand much things, so I don't see him being able to really have an opinion, if his republican colleagues told him how to think, then he'd definitely feel like getting rid of the DE.."
"'Some guy' is named Betsy.
Read the links this time"
"The states have no standing to sue the federal government to force it to continue providing funding to the states, no matter how patriotic they are. What it would really boil down to is state Representatives in the House and Senators in the Senate passing budgets to secure the funding, and possibly passing a law requiring the federal government to continue funding state level education. 2 problems with this -
1. States historically have fought hard against national standards for education. If the federal government is going to be bound to provide money for education, you can bet they're going to insist on a national standard curriculum. There's no way this country would ever be able to agree on any of that. 
2. Our Congress can't manage to get much done when it's ONLY in the interest of helping the general public. This is especially true when Congress is split and it requires a majority of both parties to get anything done. 
Oh,  ""...at least 50 states...."", I laughed way too hard at this, thank you!"
"Private schools are better because they're better funded and exclusive in who they let in. Public schools are funded by tax dollars and essentially get $X per student. Republicans are using ""school vouchers"" to take tax money out of the public school system and let it flow the student.... to private for profit schools. As more affluent (traditionally white) people switch from public to private school, there is less money available for those who remain in public education. So, poor people and people of color who can't get in to private school get a substandard education compared to the private schools - both funded (at least partially) by taxpayer money. If parents want to put their kids in private school, that's fine, but tax dollars shouldn't be taken away from public school systems because of it. 
To be clear, Republics don't want reliving taught in school. They want Christianity taught in schools. Satanic Temple is using the Republican backed ""freedom of religion"" laws to force systems that allow Christian after school clubs to also allow satanic temple school clubs. You can't have freedom of religion and then exclude religions you don't like. Many schools have closed their Christian after school programs rather than allow satanic temple programs to participate. His that for freedom of religion? It's the same way white communities shut down public pools and filled them with dirt rather than integrate and allow black students in.
The is very mainstream Republican, but just the fringe group you describe. 
As for Trump, he get behind whatever issue he thinks will get him the most money and power. As for education, why do you think he made De Vos the Education Secretary? She had no relevant experience and no relevant education. She was a strong proponent of school vouchers and he knew she'd work to dismantle the Education dept. He and his buddies would get richer off running private schools. Follow the money, always."
"I read it, I said ""some guy"" because he's really just some guy, not important nor relevant"
"It's not particularly against the 11th amendment, I'm sure the states would have to ofc settle with suing against one in particular government branch(most likely the executive) 

'_' I may need to do research, but there really should be a law standardizing the need for public education, and the federal government's need to fund them..

What I meant by the patriotism, is that states would fund themselves if it kills them, bc Kansas is the best 🤠🌻
Many people respect their state to a high extent..

Home Schooling would be the most popular type of schooling if they were able to abolish public schools..


I think we should have a national curriculum curriculum, states must teach certain things, while having their own freedoms ig.."
":/ hmm, you think a private school would lemme in even though I'm trans?"
"I see your point, :/ why appoint someone with no education? I'm guessing he probably wanted someone to relate with..
Unless she's spoken about how much she hates the first amendment right to religion, and she wants theocracy so bad 🥵  then I'd be more inclined to believe it..

Alas, this won't happen, even my radical Republican grandmother wouldn't support this(she's a teacher) 
:/"
"I agree with the beef for a national curriculum. Covid exposed the fundamental flaw in mass homeschooling - most parents aren't equipped to teach their kids (even with online assistance from schools) and working parents don't have the ability to work and be home with their kids during the day. 
If public schools were abolished, I would think that small home schools run by a couple of parents each would pop up in neighborhoods. Of course, they won't be free and there's no guarantee of who you're leaving your kids with. Of course, there would still be large for-profit schools that spring up. They would be able to buy existing school buildings for cheap and then staff them with their own teachers/workers. Essentially, it would be the complete privatization of public education, which is exactly what Republicans want to do. Why would they want to do that? 2 reasons. 
1. Get richer. Privatized education will be a huge money maker, just like the current chief system is now. 
2. This families who can't afford to send kids to privatized educating will instead send their kids to a trade school and then the work force. This creates a much larger labor pool, lower wages, and puts more profit in the pockets of the rich.
This is America. If you ever want to figure out why something is happening and who benefits from it - follow the money."
"Some will, and some won't. That's another problem with private schools. Not every student is eligible to get into one. It's an absolute tragedy how conservatives view and treat LGBTQ+ people. It's even worse that they treat kids this way. 
I hope you're in a safe and caring environment where you're respected and loved for who you are!"
"Most teachers are good with keeping religion out of the classroom. The whole point of school and education is to learn facts, learn how to critically analyze information, and learn how to decide for yourself what's right and wrong.
That's 100% opposite from what conservatives want."
":/ Well, if it looks like we'd eliminate the funded education, I assume other countries would be both puzzled, as well as infuriated, Canada would likely attempt to help..

You're definitely right, anyone who supports the dismantle of the DE definitely craves money, that system would be economically beneficial over what is in set currently.

Republicans do care about the economy over a lot of things, :/ that's been the case even in 1865, however if they continue with, their Whataboutism and their economic concerns, it's going to fail them.. 

I can't see this working out. Many Republicans and Democrats in both the House and Senate would either allow it to die, or vote against it. 

:/ I think the problem with Americans and their fears of Republicans doing this, or Dems doing that is all ran by biasedness. 
The country is divided, and the cherry on top is that barely anyone votes.. '_' my representative is anti-marijuana, anti-lgbt, and he's voted against health care bills, not at all of the people here.. 

:3 thanks for listening to my Ted talk"
"Well, discrimination laws are currently in favor of protecting the LGBT community, and the recent vote for marriage equality has shown over 50 Republicans voted in favor of it.

So it's unlikely the discrimination laws will change, so I doubt a private school could legally exclude more for being trans..

 ('__' I am not in an accepting environment, but thank you:3)"
"Yeah, they want religion-- their version of religion..

'_' according to a lot of them religion sounds really twisted.."
"Republicans care about the economy for the rich, not the working poor. It sounds like they care about us, but they don't. They scream about inflation and gas prices, but they don't DO anything about it. They're just trying to get you mad at Dems so you'll vote Republican and give them money. Look at Trump's tax cuts. Who did they help? To 1% forever, the rest of us got a smaller tax break for 3 years, then it was programmed to rise every year after that - conveniently when there's a Democrat President in office. Next you'll hear Republicans crying about how much taxes have gone up under Biden, and completely ignore the fact that this was the plan from the Republican President and these Republican Congress people voted for it! Follow the money."
"I'm sorry to hear that you're not in an accepting environment. Wherever you are, I'm sure there is a community that accepts you for who you are. I hope you are/can connect to it and recognize that you're perfectly fine being who you believe you are. If you ever need someone to talk to, you can always reach out to me, too."
"To be fair though, it's hard to do anything as a congressman, :/ 10% of bills are actually passed..
But if you look at their record in office, how many bills had they sponsored? The ones who actually sponsor bills are the ones with the most influence, they're usually household names, and have very left leaning views..

I think I'll vote Republican, and give them money 😵‍💫"

After all, this is the same country that elected Trump."
"If you have a group plan, who owns the numbers?

The person paying the bills. 

This bill gives rights to abuse victims to claim their numbers and lines."
"The point is that the abuse victim's number might be on the abuser's cell plan (quite likely, since financial control is a common method to keep someone in an abusive relationship). This would normally mean that the victim would not have the legal right to request the number be moved to a new plan, which means that their ability to keep their number (and therefore maintain contact with their friends and family) would be completely in the hands of the abuser.

This bill simply lays out a law stating that cell service providers _must_ separate the abuse victim's number into a new plan if they request it, and must do so without additional fees, and within a 2-day timespan."

"I hope he won't, but there is no way Harris would have a chance. Biden lost a lot of votes this last month, hopefully they both step aside."
"I don't think you're wrong, but I don't think he's looking forward to another term as president, either. This would be a way for him to lend his appearance of electability to Harris and ease his own fears that only he can beat Trump."
2024 would be his second term.
"At his age, having been President, if he isn't looking forward to a second term then President Biden is retiring like he wanted to do in 2016.

He ran in 2020 out of necessity. He's not stepping back to a VP slot just to make Kamala look better."
As President. He served two terms already as Vice President.
"Presidents have 2 year term limits, but there's no limit on VP... I do wonder what would happen if we had Obama for a VP with someone who planned to step down the moment they were elected...?"
"I’m quite aware of the rules of our government.

I’m saying absolutely no one who has been President of the United States is going to agree to be someone’s VP. It will never happen. It is especially ludicrous with President Biden, who not only already had the job but also wanted to retire for good in 2016. At his age, once he moves out of the White House he’s retiring to Delaware.

As for the Obama thing, Presidents can only serve two terms. If we even TRIED that, they would use it against us for a generation and it would be damn near impossible to get a Democrat elected for a while."
The Devil's fluffer
"Some of those participants have cases in front of the court, do they not? That alone is enough. That should never have happened, but politicians are gonna be politicians…and no amount of pouting and denial on their part is going to convince anyone the Supreme Court isn’t a political body."
These lizard-brained dirtbags only care about ethics when they can be used as a weapon.
This guy's entire life has been an ethical question. He's a drunken idiot.
"It’s pretty obvious. The right wing has no ethics. They have no humanity. They have no moral compass. Only a love of power and money. They aren’t even trying to hide it behind a trumped up “biblical” or “moral majority” smoke screen. They are immoral, corrupt, power hungry elitists."
"Ethical questions? Thomas wife brings up another, and they wonder why the public has lost faith in the court. When ( if ) Trump goes down it will say a lot about the people he appointed to this court"
"Hey guys, come on. He liked beer. He still likes drinking beer. I'm sure that he didn't drink enough beer to the point of blacking out, and I'm sure he only sexually assaulted maybe one person in that time."
Just one person with a recorder is all I want for xmas.
"This compromises the GOP, I don't agree with them on many things, but if they care about how they are perceived like they say they do, then they should write passed wrongs, and disown this vile human being..

Politics need to be set aside, this man is guilty of assault, politics don't matter here anymore.."
"Ethical questions? Surely by now we know that ethics no longer has anything to do with the GOP, right.  ""Unethical"" optics are being worn like badges of courage by and for MAGA.  Ethics is moot.  Even legal is a scoff at this juncture. 

Let's keep in mind, illegal didn't stop Hitler"
Why Kavanaugh’s position as a judge and just basically his existence and opinions raise ethical questions…
Every fucking thing about that tool raises ethical questions
Was he wearing a beer hat?  That's what I'm picturing.
No it doesn't
These people have no ethics. This fact has been known for a long time.
"Ethics? From a predatory liar? You’re kidding, right?"
Clarence sleeps with someone who has matters before the federal courts too.
Supreme Court justices should have 10 year terms.
"I came here to say something like this.  To me,  Kavanaugh and the Kavanaugh hearing became the symbol of all of their corruption.  Trump, Kavanaugh himself, Lindsey Graham, Grassley,  and Collins and that other fucker.   After that Jan6 wasn't that big of a surprise."
That is why the only real serious defense against them is for the left to gain power.
Somebody say beer?
"It should not surprise anyone that one term twice impeached former President Trump (who is involved in all aspects of the Trump Organization) used his infamous delaying tactics to try to put out the growing embers exploding via the flames encroaching on his organization and life.  

What is surprising is that we are just finding out about it now.

>*The Trump Organization lost a secret criminal contempt trial in October 2021 for ignoring four grand jury subpoenas and three court orders for company documents in a tax-fraud case, The New York Times reported Tuesday. While the penalty was light - a $4,000 fine, the maximum - the conviction illustrated the flawed delaying tactics used by the family company of former President Donald Trump, the newspaper noted. (In a public ruling in April, Trump himself was cited for contempt for responding inadequately to subpoenas involving his business practices).*


Everyone knows that the only time that one term twice impeached former President Trump is guaranteed to tell the truth is when his mouth is closed.

>*The one-day 2021 trial, in which prosecutors asserted the organization “willfully disobeyed” orders for records, was kept private because the subpoenas were issued by a grand jury whose work is secret, the Times reported. The order to pay the contempt fine was unsealed last week.*


The narcissistic sociopath, __unhinged insurrectionist,__ and grifter (with a pronounced case of logorrhea) known as one term twice impeached former President Trump has a pattern of explaining, excusing, deflecting and blaming others for the circumstances he finds himself in.

 
Anything one term twice impeached former President Trump can do or say to keep justice from moving forward? He will.

And we all know the writing is on the wall.

>*On Dec. 6, a New York jury found Trump Organization companies guilty of fraud and other financial crimes in a 15-year scheme that enriched executives and enabled them to dodge income tax. Trump, who wasn’t personally charged, called the prosecution a “witch hunt.”*


The Republican Party *currently supports* autocracy, bribes, bullying, cheating, control of a woman's body, dismantling the US Constitution, fascism, fear, fraud, hatred, insurrectionists, racism, stealing top secret government documents, white supremacy, __pursuit of alternative facts (lies)__ and grifting.

Does it surprise anyone that their leader is one term twice impeached former President Trump?"
Ah yes…the SECRET trials! Damn you secret trials!
So much winning.
I don’t know about you but I’m tired of all this “winning”.
I assume you are being funny because it is not a win if he lost.
I was trying to elicit a chuckle or two from your audience. I did not intend to offend.
"OK.

We don't have an audience here though. Just your fellow Redditors."
I'd like to know what legislation they have proposed that actually helps. Never see that.
Reddit.com
":/ It was voted against by my representative, Jake LaTurner, but it was a bill supporting the cause of firearm safety, and mental health, it was sponsored by Marco Rubio I believe..

Seems helpful, but I couldn't really figure out exactly what it was for.."
I believe it had a lot of added right wing nonsense.  It wasnt a clean bill - they never are if it was Rubio.
That's pretty biased..
That's my recollection.  It's difficult to find any republicans who support meaningful gun regulation.
"Yeah, Jake LaTurner voted against it..

Personally I don't know what we really can do but probably restrict certain people from purchasing guns, but I see that's about it..

I mean, unless we wanna violate the second amendment, but that's bad.."
"I’ve always said you have the right to say what you want, you don’t have the right to a microphone."
"Anytime a platform goes ""free speech"" it turns into an extreme right wing Nazi haven, why those things happen we will never know"
Free speech only means that the government can’t arrest you for speaking freely. It does not free you from the public and private consequences of your speech.
"It's easy. There's a lot of racist white people everywhere in all walks of life and now is the perfect time to let it be known. The more people who do this, the less hesitant others will be."
"At the library in my state, he was told he could book the room, UT that the library wouldn't sponsor him. This was spun by the victimization factory as ""refused to allow."" So I'm doubtful about the whole narrative."
"Damn, if only there were some tax exempt building where people go to read books but instead of reading many books, they only read religious books. Like a library but for religious books and religion themed presentations. A place where people could go to and listen to someone read a book to them. Where would such a place even exist?/s"
Because Libraries are publicly funded inclusive spaces dedicated to education. Kirk Cameron is a bigot who doesn't understand bananas.
"Good. Fuck that nutjob, he has no place anywhere near a library."
Does that mean he will support Islamic story hour too?
He’s grooming kids to his cult.  (Take emotional context out and it’s 100% true)
"Dear church,
Stay in your lane. 
-state."
is it about magical bananas?
"In my town there are two public libraries, but at least ten churches and synagogues. Poor butt-hurt Cameron might get a better reception for his fantasy books at other venues."
"As an advocate of free speech, I think he should be able to have a story hour in the library just like anyone else. It requires no promotion by the library itself, and if nobody shows up, or a bunch of people show up, it shouldn’t matter. 

The same way we expect respect and tolerance of LGBT+ books and ideas, and fight the increasing right-wing school board censorship of libraries, we should also be tolerant to ideas of religious persons. The allowance of different perspectives is a good thing."
Glad to see that hate has no place in those public libraries.
He's the one trying to groom kids.
"Look at Kirk, trying to groom."
"Although I am a support of the 1A, I feel more strongly about the separation of church and state. So, I support this move.  However, I did read someone else's comment about their library allowing it by not endorsing it.  However, he is in UT so that is a surprisingly objective compromise."
"So, lets see... how to further attempt to make villains out of libraries that allow for ""drag readings"" for kids...

1) Make the assumption that the two things are somehow equal. This is outright false, as the whole point of allowing someone in different gendered or sexed dress read to kids is meant to show inclusion and break down assumptions about other people. Mr. Cameron's ideology is the exact opposite of this.

2) Make Mr. Cameron into some kind of victim being turned down...*because he's Christian?* No, because he's attempting to be an activist Christian. He is well known for his non-inclusive and frankly hateful beliefs. 

3) Assume the damn book warrants a reading to kids at a library. I don't know for sure, but I don't think the Drag Queens are reading from their own books. Is there any merit to Mr. Cameron's book? Is it good? Is his message and is the intent of this entire stunt worth the time and resources of a **publicly funded institution?**"
Let the Screwball Evangelicals and the Drag Queens read to each other. I don't want either group around young children. Growing up is confusing enough without tales of invisible sky demons and men pretending to be women. A pox on both their houses when it comes to kids.
Let him rent a room. Leave the libraries alone.
This is exactly the kind of thing Fox would make into a story. 🤦🏻‍♂️
"The Streisand effect marketing strategy! Say what you want about his books, this is viral marketing at it’s finest."
"Projection projection projection - the only ones reliant on ""grooming"" are the ones trying to catch children with their bronze age goat herder myths."
God works in mysterious ways…
"same coin, different sides"
"The library that was contacted in my state also told the publisher that they are free to book a community room themselves and host the event. 

So many people waltz in here and think story hour is just a bunch of random kids in a room with any person available reading to them at whatever time of day. Story hours are planned, themed, include crafts and interaction, and need to be run by someone who has been thoroughly vetted with background checks and references. This is why it's a full time, library staffed position and the story hours are divided by age groups and have waitlists. Cameron's publishing house called specific libraries that have hosted drag story hours in the past and asked if someone from their publishing house could host a biblical story hour ""against 'woke' culture and CRT."" Of course the library said no. And the library STILL said you could book a room and host it yourself. And it's still being spun like the library refused Kirk Cameron's book. Never in the calls with this publishing house was Kirk Cameron and his book even brought up. This publisher is just a marketing whiz and came up with a great way to drum up free publicity."
"There's a big brick building in my town with a funny spike on it's roof that does this a couple times a week. I've never been, but Sunday seems like the most popular day."

"No, that's the drag queens!  JUST KIDDING!  =D"
"He was told he could do his story hour at the branch of our library that his organization contacted..,just that the library wouldn't sponsor it. Seems that was a violation of his Constitutional right to sponsorship. Or something."
Should secular books be able to be read at all tax exempt book clubs?
"Cults are not the same as minorities.

One is reliant on twisting logic and reason and socially pressuring kids into abandoning the evidence of their senses.  One is the way someone is born."
Like that Florida stooge for DeSantis who just whacked himself.
"Once again, the 1A doesn't apply to reading books in a library."
"I have been an LGBTQ+ alley since it was just LG. ;-)  However, I question the value to the children of having drag queens read to children.  This seems to be more self-serving to the LGBTQ+ community than to the community at large.  What might be interesting to kids older than - say - 8 or 9 , would be to have the drag queens show up dressed just as normal men one day and as their drag personal the next."
"People have no idea how much work is gone into planning events for kids. I work with kids, and people think it's just playing games and making sure the kids won't hurt each other of themselves . We have to plan activites. It's nuts he thought he could waltz in and just do story time."
"And if you go to certain churches, the ladies have clothing as outlandish as any drag show I’ve ever seen."
I think fox is just concentrating on the libraries that turned him away and making it about that. I’m sure some libraries said it was ok. They are just making drama.
"Yeah my gut is public libraries are for everyone. Although they are no place for hate speech, I'm generally fine with Christian, Jewish, Muslim and Satanic children's books being able to hold story readings as long as the central messages are not hateful."
I don’t understand the difference. What does sponsoring entail? And do the libraries sponsor other events?
I’m not sure where you’re going with this.
On what do you base that assumption?  There has been of many 1st Amendment cases related to library censorship.  The American Library Association's Bill of Rights states the importance of libraries defending the 1st Amendment.
Ever been to high mass at an orthodox or Catholic church?
They mentioned our library by name...even though they were told they could do it. They are equating not being sponsored with not being allowed. Typical lies from the right.
"That's the issue. One faction in the US has embraced the politics of hate. We are content neutral on the use of library facilities, but that doesn't mean we have to cooperate and sponsor hate."
"We have programs that we solicit and promote, versus programs that are put on by community members themselves in the library's program room. Cameron's publisher was free to do the second one, but given their politics of hate, the library wasn't going to be a participant."
Churches exist. It’s already a place where religious books are presented and discussed.
He doesn't know what a book club is I guess.
"Well they aren’t censoring him, just not endorsing his speech or platform."
I asked in another comment but what is sponsoring in this context?
"We have programs that we solicit and promote, versus programs that are put on by community members themselves in the library's program room. Cameron's publisher was free to do the second one, but given their politics of hate, the library wasn't going to be a participant."
Why is all the vitriol necessary? Why can't people mind their own business? Live and let live? Why does this have to be a political issue at all?
"They have been chosen as the right’s target of the day. Jews, Muslims, black people, gay men - all have had their turn. But right now the designated victims are trans people."
Glad someone is finally addressing this.  Things are boiling over with all the new anti gay legislation in red states we are literally one step away from lgbqti communities being rounded up and sent to camps.  We need to stand up now before it's too late
Stop saying we *feel* under siege.  We *are* under siege.  Stop.
This is the direct result of trump's latest tirades and the right wing nut job's obsession with choosing pronouns as something to mock. Please be safe out there.
Good
it's in part a pushback against the most extreme TRAs...
"Because if Republicans don't have people to hate, they might realize the politicians they're supporting are fucking them for the benefit of the 1%."
"Because republicans have no plan to make America better. All they have is wedge issues and culture wars.  

“If you can’t legislate, spread hate”"
"I came here to say something, and everyone already said it. This has *nothing* to do with helping, preventing harm, or any other real issue outside of finding a group that can't fight back and bullying them.

I live in a Red-ass state. The Republican majority spends all of its time creating problems that don't exist to fight as opposed to helping anyone they have access to. Everyone remains poor, unhealthy, and undereducated. The money stays in the top, protected by the government and their rich drinking buddies. Its disgusting really. 

But everyone won't have to worry soon about people getting gender reassignment treatments. Because that problem effects...wait... who does that affect again....?"
"Religions that influence these peoples beliefs, and their concepts of heaven, do not work if you cannot vilify others who don’t get into your heaven."
Because Republicans have decided that “reality” is a political position and they’re opposed to it.
"Like 99% do, both conservatives and liberals and a hugely loud and obnoxious vocal minority to stir crap up and of course news today is hyperbolic AF so they try to blanket everyone as if it’s some huge war when it’s not. 

You have absolute idiots on both sides. I know a crap ton of liberals and conservatives who are sane and honestly don’t care because of the exact reason of “that’s their life, if your old enough to make decisions and those decisions let you lead a life you want without bothering how I want to live? Then go nuts.” 

According to CNN we are seconds from a civil war and honestly….we are not. It’s just loud noise to generate clicks and drama absolutely gets clicks/views."
Surely you’re overreacting? What exactly is going on?
I work in healthcare environments that are understandably very pro-trans rights and during the Obama years everyone was pushing through all sorts of tracking and documentation of trans issues. Knowing that the political winds change and that this info could be used nefariously I would always caution people to be mindful of this. I can totally see these fascist fucks changing patient privacy laws to persecute people if they get the chance.
Good that trans people feel under siege?
"Don't know what the fuck a ""TRA"" is, but 99% chance that it's not actually something that exists."

Do people in heaven have awareness of those not in heaven?
"""Both Sides"". Right."
Well only one side so far has tried to overthrow the government and that same side is the only one trying to take away the rights and freedoms of groups so I would say it’s definitely not “vocal minorities on both sides”
"Texas AG Paxton sought a registry of any gender change in the past two years. Texas, Florida, and Tennessee are dangerous enough for trans people and their families to flee. If you have the means and you live in a safe place for trans people, help shelter them."
"No, absolutely not. That’s horrible."
"Ha, irony."
"people who think transwomen belong in female sports, for one."
How does it kill trans people? I’m so tempted to not take people seriously when they say that.
The conflation of calling queer people groomers and a state with historically bad records on human rights creating a registry is not good. A registry of the marginalized is the first step in genocide.
Even if contextually valid?
How is an anti-trans politician making a registry of trans people any sort of contextually valid?

Shouldn’t those bills be sent to the the shooter instead
I have a friend who was at Pulse and got out as he was on the patio.  No injuries.  Very lucky.  He lost so much money as he found it hard to work. He has big time survivors guilt.  Seen multiple psychiatric doctors.  He’s never been the same and never will be.  His recovery is expensive and he wasn’t even injured.  Imagine adding medical bills if you had been shot but survived.   Good grief.
"If weapons required licenses and insurance, this would be taken care of."
We should send the bill to the gun nuts who insist on their availability.
America. Where they let you buy an AR15 at 18 w/ a mental illness but won't take care of the consequences. Isn't America great? Thanks the GOP for that insanity.
Bill should be taken care of by the state or fed in these circumstances. These hospitals are disgusting with how much they charge.
Or his family?
"So sorry  about your friend. Yes, at least he wasn't shot."
"The premiums would be so insane no one would pay it, and that’s if you can find a company that’s dumb enough to think it’s actuarially sound to write"
Hey a “Mass shooting tax” added to gun purchases. I like that actually. We add huge taxes to cigarettes and alcohol to discourage their use so I see nothing wrong with gun taxes.
"Not so sure about the family.  As someone who has family they have tried time and time to help,  I can't be responsible for the bad actions of my family member, even if they are coming from a place of illness, and not just malfeasance."
Or the manufacturer of the guns
"Let's not forget that the U.S. government has stepped in before with the TRIA act to cover losses due to terrorism. 

If the government allows guns and weapons as a right, let the taxpayers provide the same insurance coverage to individuals that TRIA provided to businesses."
The premiums would be cheap because insurance doesn’t pay out for intentional criminal acts.
"Nah. Starts at the family level. If you’re breeding that much hate, intolerance, and lack of empathy for others that someone in your family shoots up a place, you on the hook too."
"Good point, so insurance for this as a concept is completely pointless"
"This is among the more ignorant comments I've ever read on Reddit. I hate to break it to you, but great parents can have awful kids and awful parents can have great kids. Sure, there's a greater chance that good parents will have good kids, but it ain't a lock."
"Reddit is growing more ignorant by the day. 

Yes - let's charge innocent people for the crimes of the guilty. Because we don't agree with their politics or something. 

If you can prove a parent was negligent or aided in access to a weapon, that's one thing. Going after people like the ideology police is straight out of last generation's Republican books. Don't be like them."
"And family doesn't imply childern... like if my sister or a sibling in law does something, and I wasn't involved in raising them, or perhaps even know them, then why am I implicated?  Especially If I have helped, or attempted to help."

"I clicked into link, issue 1 arises with the word “California”. The laws there are exceptionally strict and technically in violation of 2A but that’s another discussion. This is a home made firearm and some build things simply to build things. Even having a part of an Armalite Rifle (AR..that’s what that actually means, Armalite is a company and it is shortened to AR which has been re-labeled to claim that means Assault Rifle)

So yeah I’d say simply having an AR upper as well as a homemade firearm with no serial number would absolutely be illegal there. Some build them simply to see if it can be done. Enthusiasts I suppose. To borrow from Jurassic Park…”he was so preoccupied with whether or not he could he didn’t stop to think if he should.”

Then you add in California with “approved” firearms. Firearms sold there are “approved” some are not. There are weak crappy guns not allowed in California simply because they make sure to crawl through approval process. For example. A Glock 19 9mm is approved to be sold, but there some .22 and .380 caliber guns are not.

Hopefully that helps. Disclosure that I am pro 2A, and I agree that weapon should be taken as it’s not legal."
"It's illegal because I think it's a short-barrelled rifle, or SBR.

SBR's are legal, but you need an ATF tax-stamp, which is about $200.  

Of course someone on the subreddit said it was illegal because of the foregrip.

In all honesty, despite being a firearm enthusiast, I couldn't tell you what exactly did him in because California has really funky laws, along with the ATF.  There's a graphic that I'm too lazy to search up that has the details."
"All guns should be illegal, full stop.  The national guard meets the 2a definition of militia, short of that no civilian needs a firearm.  That's the liberal position and we aren't backing down until every gun is off the streets"
"your post is titled 'question...' but there's not a single question in your post.

The democratic party platform on guns is here: [https://democrats.org/where-we-stand/the-issues/preventing-gun-violence/](https://democrats.org/where-we-stand/the-issues/preventing-gun-violence/).  You can probably consider that the mainstream liberal position.

There is a very wide spectrum of opinions on guns on the left.  There are firearm abolitionists.  There are radical anarchists who think firearms for hunting and defense are a critical element of resilient self-sufficiency and protecting our communities from fascists.  There are black nationalists who think that black firearm ownership is a bulwark against white supremicist systemic deprivation."
"In CA you can legally build your own as long as you apply for a serial number in advance and stamp it on during manufacture.  So long as you do this step in advance, you can indeed legally DIY an AR lower in CA (80%, 3D printed, etc.).

Neat part about this is that it also means that you can teach others how to make their own, and you aren't a firearms dealer either.  So it may even be a decent way to get others into firearms in general too."
"Really trying not to be snaky or cause a fight.  This is in total spirit of the OG post, just for understanding.   Your last comment “you are pro 2A but think the weapon should be taken as it’s not legal” - doesn’t that go against the 2A?  I usually run into folks on social media who go full in with the 2A “shall not infringe”. You seem nuanced with being 2A but think some weapons should be taken/not legal.   (For the record…I think a nuanced approach to our gun violence is honestly the most realistic path to improving the situation)."
"It's an AOW because of the grippy thingy on the barrel. You also need the tax stamp, but it's only $5. Or unscrew the grippy thingy and it's just a pistol."
"The liberal position is interpreting rights expansively, protecting them strenuously, and fighting against anyone trying to interpret away a right. Gun control is anti-liberal."
There's no such thing as an absolute right. I'm pro 2A myself. I think liberals should arm themselves for their own protection.
Many do.
"It's a crazy world, and it's getting crazier every day."
"Indeed which is amazing since crime rates in the US have plunged dramatically over the last 30 years, but I too feel it’s crazy out there.  Too many unhinged folks it seems."
Get started on the constitutional amendment
"Politicians for sure need limits, total served. State and federal. 2 terms and out for both. Win congress twice? You can’t run for anything ever again as example. AND you get no pension or special treatment and cannot own stocks or a board seat to any company before, during and after like 4 years. Make them live with the decisions they make in office."
"For SCOTUS, I'd say 18 year terms. That way every president gets 2 appointments per term and a generational turnover of the court. 

I'm not entirely certain how it would affect the court, though. There's a chance we'd see more strictly partisan justices since there's a definite limit, but we could also see more swing justices. I'd say it's more likely we'd get the former."
"I like this except I’d say 10 years (5 terms) for the house and the 18 years for the Supreme Court, as someone else suggested"
"Why have two terms at all?

One term for all elected positions. Six years. No possibility of election.

For judges, 20 is too much. Make it equal to three terms of elected offices(so 18 years).

If you want to do away with corporate influence, make it so there are more people in Congress who can't possibly get corporate donations for another run."
"My idea is 18 years for the Supreme Court, 9 justices staggered one every other year.

It will get a reliable stream of new blood into the court, but is still a long enough time that the justices can be considered ""above the fray"" of daily politics. Also, it means that every president gets to appoint 2 justices per term, predictably and on schedule, and hopefully we can avoid the current circus of shameless partisan hackery every time one of them suddenly dies."
"I think it should be 17 or 18 years for Justices

And something like a combined 32 years in congress with maximums of 3 terms in the senate and 10 terms in the house separately (meaning if you transition from one to the other, your time in office is capped at a TOTAL of 32 years)

States with strict and severe term limits are often among the most corrupt in the country for the simple reason that the legislature becomes a training ground for future corporate lobbyists 

We don’t want that nationally

So term limits
Which are a good idea

Need to be LONG"
"While I don't have specific formulated opinions about exactly what term limits should be for various elected or appointed positions, I am wholly in favor of them and believe that we need to look both at the number of terms one can serve and add a mandatory retirement expectation. 

Well fed and careful for people (the wealthy types that are most often elected) live long lives these days. And yes, some people maintain their faculties and abilities well into their 70s or even 80s... but I don't think they should be governing at that point. I don't believe that a person of that age is usually in touch with the majority of generations behind them, not in any meaningful way. Yes, I'm sure there are cases that prove otherwise, but I don't feel they're the rule, just the exception. 

SCOTUS is an excellent example of this for me. They say they're there just to maintain the rule of law and not to set policy, but we have all seen recently this is just not the case. It is impossible for someone to not inject their own personal beliefs and wishes , especially when their work has such a reaching and important influence. I don't believe that someone should hold onto a position of importance until they just physically can't anymore. And I don't believe that an 80 year old judge can really appreciate the ramifications of their legal opinions on people 60 years their junior.

Appoint a judge. All the way to the Supreme Court, then make them retire by age 65. Period."
"But presidents only get 8 years? 
Say Joe Biden is the first to appoint these justices in 2023, then he serves 8 years in office, from 2020 to 2028.
Then let's say the next president is elected twice also, from 2028 to 2036, :/ the justices cannot be appointed.. 
I might've misread this, but I really don't understand how presidents would get to appoint Justices twice, since you're saying justices will get 18 years each.."
I’d even like them to no longer list parties and simply list policies. People vote only for party which is insane.
"Why long? :/ I thought the point of term limits was to prevent an authoritarian installment in our government, as well as get new ideas, if we have the same people, our laws will stay the same for a long time, we'll evolve into an unevolved society.."
"Then we'd have a less flow of ideas, as that's the objective in adding term limits, we want new ideas."
"Sorry, I recognize that I wasn't clear in my previous post (damned typing on a phone).  One justice is appointed every other year (let's say during the odd years so there's less pressure around elections/campaign seasons).  So if we worked back a couple of years, Biden would get one in each of '21 and '23 (and maybe 2 more in '25 and '27).  Then, another president gets one each in '29 and '31 (and maybe 2 more in '33 and '35).  Then, the next president gets one in '37 and again in '39 (the one appointed in '39 would replace the one appointed in '21). And so on and so forth.  As for how to ""phase out"" the current justices, I think an obvious solution would be that they'd be phased out in order of their current tenure on the court.  


One of the things I'd like about this approach is that the justices would (ideally) reflect the more current will of the voters.  If this system had been in place from the time the court expanded to 9 justices, the current makeup of the court would be 5-4 liberal appointees, with a 6-3 court when the next justice is appointed."
"I answered your question already. States with term limits have the most corruption because the legislature essentially becomes a space people enter to get noticed by lobbyists.

If there’s no longevity, the incentives are only to focus on how congress gets you to the NEXT thing. 

On top of that, institutional memory is important. As is legislators having enough time to build skills and relationships to get things done. 

We need some changeover because some people are in power too long, and we need parties to be better incentivized to build a bench. BUT we don’t want more corruption"
"Actually, yk, that's not exactly a bad idea..
In fact it's a good idea.. then we wouldn't have people upset about how Biden chose these nine justices, so next presidents wouldn't feel like they would have to change the law bc of who Biden did or didn't appoint..
It's like unbiased.

:3 Smart."
":/ Maybe lobbyists aren't the problem, maybe we should vote for people who have steady beliefs..

Idk where the conversation is at anymore.."
I think we need to live in the real world and pursue political and policy strategies that are proven to work rather than just wishing for things to be different and hoping whatever policy feels good achieves that
"Yeah, like national term limits, it works for our presidents, we've seen that for decades..
We also need more representatives, :/ the population is growing, and so should the representative's population..

Imagine, we'll have 1,108 in Congress, including the 100 senators, and if they can't possess decade long career, and we have over 1,000 delegates, lobbyism will die..
There's too many delegates, how can you convince them all? They keep changing every few years too, it'll give the youth an opportunity to see how voting works, young people are the ones who don't vote typically.."
"I think we need more representatives too but you aren’t grounding your ideas in an understanding of policy, this country, or how any of this works"
"I know how it works? I studied it all, I'm very interested..
'_' I'm saying how it should work however, expressing my opinions, not how it is currently.."
"I’m just seeing wishful thinking without a theory of the case

I’m sorry"
"I don't understand.. 
It's ok, no need to apologize"
What don’t you understand
Why you say wishful thinking or whatever.. yo no comprendo
"Because all you keep saying is “imagine this” and “it would be good if that”

You’re not explaining how or why you think it would be achievable 

And your general ideas of why you think these things would be good also don’t make sense to me"
":/ but like it would be good for us to adopt congressional term limits because then that would offer more ideas in our government, as well as make young people want to vote more.
Imagine if we had more people in Congress also, this is good because it would be more difficult for lobbyists to persuade the 1108 congressman and women..

Did I improve?"
"No. Sorry. 

I’ve provided a concrete reason why term limits should be applied with the caveat that they would be LONG because there is evidence from state legislatures that they INCREASE corruption (https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2018/01/18/five-reasons-to-oppose-congressional-term-limits/amp/) 

And you just keep going “ :/ but “ instead of actually engaging with the point"
"I can't engage with that point though? You hadn't mentioned it, however you're not necessarily wrong, with Congress having term limits, that would motivate lobbyists to lobby as much as possible.

States like TN have term limits, and as we know they joined the confederacy.. they've had corruption before term limits..

Many things states do is corrupt however, Kansas'governor made so many promises, Texas and New Mexico may or may not have government authorities connected with the Cartel. :/ And Hawaii's the poorest state, with most of the homeless being natives. 
So from all of that, it seems to me like term limits really don't intertwine in any of the corruption of the states.

I'm open to ideas, and progress, I've observed your concern. 
However, I don't find it all that necessary, as corruption exists even if there's no term limits.. 
Term limits are needed for the president, you haven't shown any non-support of this, but do you agree with the 22 amendment? 
If you can agree with that, then how can you disagree with the same thing for congress members? 
Our government doesn't need aged people in power, I, and many Americans don't want a nursing home as our government. 
Not only that, but term limits welcome new ideas.

Also, term limits are supposed to ensure tranquility, which is what the Constitution claims we must have, '_' are you saying you disagree with the Constitution?

If that's the case, I can't imagine you supporting libertarian ideals.."

The deplorables have turned on each other! Such a shock! Smh...
The GOP are so far off what the rest of America wants and needs.
Mystery candidate!  Oh how exciting.  It’s reality TV with out govt now!
This sounds like an excellent way to have a Democrat elected speaker in a majority Republican House.
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahajahahahahahahahahahajahahahahahahaha+ha♾️= ♾️Ha
Watching these idiots do anything is going to be chaotic and hilarious. Whoever gets the gavel is going to be doing a job akin to herding 300 feral cats into a small cage. They’ll eat their own. I hope McCarthy does win. It’ll be fun watching him deal with team crazy and team normal and the democrats who I hope do everything they can to make sure he’s miserable and wishes he never got the Speaker. Stupid twats.
No honor among thieves.
He’ll probably nominate Trumpf.
We’re going to need a bigger bowl of popcorn…
"Forcing another candidate to come out of the woodwork and run for the seat might be a good idea.

>*Biggs and his right-wing colleagues in the House Freedom Caucus hope to force party leaders to share more power with rank-and-file members instead of deciding on bills behind closed doors and then putting them up for a vote without much member input.*

Many Republicans have come forward and said they would not vote for McCarthy

>*McCarthy needs 218 votes to win when the House selects its speaker in January, and it will take as few as five Republican nays to thwart his victory.*

Clearly, America is not interested in the stolen election theories put forth by one term twice impeached former President Trump.

The reason we know this to be true? America came out in droves, and they voted during the last election.

>*Biggs, who has served in Congress since 2017 and was directly involved in former President Donald Trump’s attempt to overthrow the 2020 election, can’t get 218 votes, either. But he believes someone else will rise to the occasion.*

America is not interested in Trumpism and all other standards for.

>*But McCarthy has already said that he’ll restore Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) to the committee seats that Democrats denied them because of their conspiracy theories and threatening behavior.*

We need accountability.

Clearly, that is what America voted for during our last election.

Republicans need to listen to the voters if they hope to accomplish anything positive for America."
They can't even listen to the voters.
"Unlikely. Near impossible. BUT if Democrats throw their support behind McCarthy to give him the speakeship, they could get a favorable deal on the debt ceiling and committed positions. If he doesn’t, they could threaten to elevate Biggs’ candidate to the position. A Democratic Senate can check a far-right Speaker, so this would be more about weakening the Speaker position far more than McCarthy wants."
"OMG.

The nightmare."
"Yes.

And extra root-beer."
The problem in politics for doing something in exchange for something else is there's absolutely no way to police it. He could agree to it and then after he's elected speaker not agree to it. I'm sure there's a process to pluck him out though. Like a vote of no confidence or something.
I would not trust McCarthy on any deal he makes.
If Democrats think any Republican has the slightest integrity and would follow through with any deal made they’re even stupider than they obviously are.
"Then impeach Biden and then Harris and then …

(Yes, I realize that there would never be a conviction in the senate, but I wouldn’t be surprised if that was what he was thinking)"
"It’s no less enforceable than any deal McCarthy can cut with Biggs to back down. But if you can’t trust the Speaker to honor his word, you can’t trust him to hold a vote on that bill you want passed or anything else. Being Speaker means having sustained support."
"I’m not banking on McCarthy having integrity, I’m banking on him being able to foresee consequences for his own self interest"
It's a fair point.
"I watched a video by a liberal lawyer. He agreed with the ruling and said this is the judge telling the DOJ to indict now or drop the case. The contempt of court declaration would be very weak anyway. Does the DOJ think it would make Trump comply? He has lied to their faces and on paper over and over. 

Time to indict."
Good. Though it's taking forever for any consequences to actually reach him.
Why this special privilege - we all know this guy is a criminal! “No one is above the law” in my view is total bullshit!
"Stolen classified documents. Has been photographed with caught spies. An lied about having any more stolen documents.  

All of this after inspiring an insurrection and spreading lies that undermine democracy. 

All of that after ""enjoying"" downplaying the seriousness of a pandemic in which a million people died. Statics show his actions are responsible for 40% of their deaths!

There's no good reason Trump and his accomplises should be in the office or walking around free."
"Having worked primarily in criminal law, I can say with some degree of certainty that criminal cases are not swift. And, this is a sensitive case although it shouldn’t be. You do not want to be the person to indict a former president and then lose the case because you left room for error. Although we don’t see it or hear it, I can also assure you that there are a lot of attorneys and paralegals researching every single aspect of this matter. They need to have all the facts and details and evidence (which they are lacking because it seems as if Trump has documents all over the place. Who knows? Maybe he’s sold some documents to the highest bidder already? There could be many reasons why they haven’t indicted him yet.) However, I believe they will at some point in the future. Again, federal prosecutors win something like 95% of the cases they bring against defendants. Also, I don’t think we will see Trump in prison . Like, ever. He has secret service protection for the rest of his miserable life. What are they gonna do? Hang out in the pokey and make sure no one hard dicks him when he drops the soap with his freaky baby hands? Our best hope is that he loses everything. Mara Lago, his jet, his wife..everything. It’d be nice to see him living in a little two bedroom house with a 10 year old Honda that he can only drive to the store and church because he’s gotta wear an ankle bracelet the rest of his even more miserable life. I think prison would be too good for him. He’d be a hero with the white supremacy crowd. A two bedroom house with no internet would be the perfect way for him to live out his days."
I’m happy for Trump. Hope he wins 2024 🇺🇸
"I do agree. Don’t bring a case you can’t win! The feds are known for bringing cases and a great win ratio. I was hoping this was the issue with the DOJ being slow with Donnie. Still hoping. Detested this bastard for decades( I am THAT old) I want to see him( he won’t ever do prison time), broke( I mean really broke) and NEVER to be able to hold office anywhere. Sadly he will still have a voice. Shame it went from commenting on Diet Coke and Robert Paxton’s love life to playing POTUS."
"Actually, every modern president has had similar privileges. Like how our previous 5 presidents weren't impeached over war crimes or taking government property, but they all did it. He's a giant douche and taking all these documents was inappropriate, but at the end of the day who cares. 

There's bigger fish to fry. Like universal health care or even PAID TIME OFF for railway workers."
"It takes a DOJ/AG willing to go after him.

We have neither."
"Truly.

It boggles the mind how Republicans can just sweep things under the carpet. In order to pretend:

■ it never happened.

■ that no one will notice.

Everyone who cares notices."
Move on to what? Acceptance of a lawless government?
"Looks like:  This is an insincere leading statement trying to establish themselves as part of the ‘group’ and make people feel left out and uncool if they aren’t part of ‘moving on’ that the poster is advocating.

I would bet money that later in this thread the poster goes full mask-off and dives into Q adjacent conspiracy theory territory.

I’ll scroll down and if I’m wrong will edit this comment with contrition.

EDIT: I was correct.  Im not surprised but I’m still disappointed."
"Moving on is what trump and his moron acolytes should have done after the disgraced ex-president failed in his re-election bid. But he didn’t, so someone needs to wipe the shit stain off of the public stage and flush his ass to obscurity."

"Honestly it probably still is a big part of it. If you really think about it its not like any of these crimes were simple and carried out by just him. On his own he couldn't have done half of what he did. There are at least dozens of people if not more mixed up in everything. 

To be clear I do think we absolutely should have enough to bring at least some charges, and honestly I wish they would bc the rest can be pursued for a long time. But I'm entirely positive its a much more complicated investigation than most of us can fully comprehend not being in the loop."
"Possession of classified docs itself is a crime.

Anyone else not Trump would already be in prison, having gone through seizure, charges, trial, and sentencing.

"I definitely believe it IS complex. I was a young when I recall Nixon leaving the WH and Ford becoming POTUS and pardoning and all that and I recall YEARS of Watergate. Truly, and yes, what Nixon did was bad, BUT it seemed like start to finish of what he did, he was GONE. I can’t believe this POS was IN office doing what he did( conflict of interest w/ businesses, whole crap w/ so many other things and STILL continued) I am proud of the younger women who spoke up, BUT the OLD POS he had in there who kept quite because they somehow wanted an authoritarian regime, make me want to puke.

"""Current administration""

No way you will provide facts verifiable through sources better than Fox News and Rudy Giuliani. Donald Trump is a fucking criminal and has been for decades, based on multiple actual verifiable accounts and legal proceedings. Fuck everyone who ever supported him and his pussy grabbing."
"Certainly not Trump? His administration and cronies had more arrested and convicted than any administration in over 50 years. More pardons written, etc., so if you think the Biden administration has anything on this show proof.

Otherwise it seems as though you may not be totally qualified to judge the Biden administration adequately."

"When I feel like that, I think back on Watergate. If I'm remembering right, it took longer than two years to get Nixon to just resign, and he didn't do anything as bad as Donald and they didn't have to do a full investigation and trial.

News of the Watergate break-in broke, hearings were begun, one by one more people testified, inch by inch they got closer and closer. But it still took over two years for the investigation and hearings to finally turn up enough evidence to convince enough Republican senators to vote for convicting him, so those Republicans then went to him and told him he needed to resign because they weren't behind him any more.

If he didn't, it probably would have been another full year for a completed investigation, ducks in a row, and impeachment trial. It fucking sucks HARD that justice goes so damn slow, but there we go.  It's why I still think voting is so important - get the bastards out before they can do more damage, then let justice catch up."

https://youtu.be/MjLMnqjOfJw?t=378"
Democrats fear Walker because it would be another fucking mornonic GOP Senator
"More like the GOP wanted Walker to win to “prove” that they aren’t racist.

Every good racist has to have a black friend for cover."
"Tokenism at is peek here.  “Why, I’m not racist…look there is Sen Tim Scott!  Hi Senator, lovey day we are having, is it” - Sen Graham"
"“We’re supporting a caricature of what we think a black man is, see we’re not racist!”"
"Republicans: How do we show we aren’t racist 

Republicans: I know let’s try an elect a black football player with multiple concussions no political acumen no legislative experience and has paid multiple women to abort multiples of his babies and he beat them 

Republicans: THATS GENIUS!"
"If you have to constantly prove you’re not racist, you just might be racist."
Wrong. It would prove that the Republican Party likes useful idiots over quality candidates
"&#x200B;

No. Wrong."
"In a race between two African American men, this is nonsensical. Additionally, it is way oversimplified. You can be a racist and still run a black candidate."
Their whole use of him in that regard IS the racism.
"I live in a more GOP place I ever have in my entire life (rural America). I am OLD. When I heard the crap about Obama being POTUS for 8 years,and saw the great loss of house seats, because a black man won the presidency, I knew Trump would win. I also knew I would NEVER vote GOP again. Rural America is racist. The GOP panders to their base, who is largely racist."
"Herschel Walker is a former gladiator who spouts conservative talking points. Nothing more, nothing less. He has served no other purpose in the lives of (at the very least) symbolically racist people, than playing football for a winning team and backing Christo-nationalist propaganda.

Herschel is about as black as OJ Simpson.

The vast majority of people I know, who’ve given him support, are suburban & rural “Go Dawgs” types who will shit on the University of Georgia for being a bastion protecting liberal ideas—despite watching their team play every Saturday. It’s fucking ridiculous."
No. It would mean there was another blithering idiot in our government.
"For him to assume that Democrats feared he would win because he’s black, and not because he’s an imbecile, speaks volumes…"
Because they would have elected their favorite football player?
"Sorry, Lindsey, the GOP nominating an unfit person for an office because of their celebrity shows not just that you are racist but also not faithful to the fundamental principles of democracy. Your idea of a quality candidate went no further than the thickness of Mr. Walker's skin. Who's the real racist here?"
Lindzey Flip Flopper Two Faced Graham Cracker
Is that tim scott I hear shouting in the background?
Graham’s new word for the day…. Token
Yes that is it ms Lindsay
Might as well call him “Token” if that’s their argument.
Is water at room temp wet.?
Lol
Welp?
Guarantee you enough republicans didn’t vote for him because he was black to make a difference
and whose only goal was to obstruct legislation and push extremist agenda.
So by his admission does this mean that they are racist?
"The old, “I’m not racist.  I have a black friend” excuse."
Looking at you Tim Scott.
"well that is exactly the same as a big chunk of the base, so it made sense in that sense. not excusable though"
(Who will watch their team play every Saturday unless there's a bunch of black people kneeling and quietly protesting).
Yes.
"Tim Scott the Congressman, or Tim Scott the White supremacist??"
Because he is owned by corporate sponsors
"2 of the largest employers in his state are fast food chains and Walmart. 

Follow the money."
The deep pockets of mining companies
"$15? Should be $30, don't set the sights low."
"To be fair, $15 an hour is unrealistic for the vast majority of his state."
"""What do you mean ppl can't live off of $5 and hour?!!"""
Are their any sources for this? I assumed corruption but I couldn’t really find much I know he does get big donations from the oil and fossil fuel industry but I don’t think that’s directly the same thing
Yeah but don’t those pay more than 15 dollars usually? Probably because they are dangerous
Actually it isn’t… If you look at the average salary it’s actually greater than 15 I just don’t see a reason
"To the people who are downvoting me without offering an argument against me, $15 an hour is 30k a year, in a place where you can get a decent 2 bed/2 bath apartment for $700 a month in the biggest city in the state.

West Virginia is dirt poor, and minimum wages need to be set based on cost of living, not some vague number."
Those are most certainly corporate sponsors
"If you can get a job paying well NOT mining coal, how long are you gonna be a coal miner?"
"… duh… the average is the middle point of all incomes averaged out. About 50% of incomes should be below the average and 50% above… that’s how an average works.

Edit: that’s actually more a median salary, but as a rule of thumb it works for averages as well +/- 10%"
Yeah but don’t those industries usually pay 15 dollars per hour at the minimum? That’s why I’m kinda confused
The median is the middle value the average/mean is different
“The mean (average) of a data set is found by adding all numbers in the data set and then dividing by the number of values in the set.”
"He gets campaign donations from a variety of industries, not just fossil fuels"
"Please note the edit. As a general rule of thumb the numbers will not be far of in terms of reported incomes.

Median is 51k vs average of 59k for WV. Either way, my point stands."
This is an article I found of the various industries that give him donations but all of these usually pay more than 15 that’s why I’m confused [source](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/10/a-closer-look-at-joe-manchins-ties-to-the-fossil-fuel-industy/)
I found other companies like Lowe’s and CVS arhat also donate to him
Can you give a source?
"Same, but, if the candidates for President were Warnock against literally any other Republican, I'd vote Warnock."
"Well he won a Senate seat, not the presidency so I'm not sure what the problem is."
Party most certainly matters especially when religion is involved. The religious left is in no way comparable to the religious right. I do agree that we definitely don’t need any more religion in our politics irregardless of political affiliation.
What if you had to pick between a fascist and a former Reverend?  Because that would probably be this hypothetical race.
"This reminds me of the 2012 Presidential election. If I had to pick between Romney and Warnock, I would pick Warnock. Romney's religious views would have probably affected certain minority communities. While Warnock would probably respect all communities."
"Potentially he is the kind of religious that understands that all people are created equal and that the separation of church and state is real and constitutional. It’s the Southern right wing religious nuts that shun logic, history and science that are a threat."
"He is not the kind of pastor who wants to blur the lines of the separation of church and state. He is guided by his principles, they are not a means of legislation. He will be consistent to his faith. Obama, Clinton, Carter and Kennedy were all guided by their faith. 

What specifically would concern you?"
Not exactly a convincing win either especially as he was up against someone clearly less qualified than a potato.
"Is he being floated for president at this point? Huh.

Anyway, I’d not by default be against an activist pastor from his particular tradition."
okay.
"President Carter was a Deacon and Sunday school teacher, but I think that’s the closest to a preacher that we’ve had."
"As far a chrisitan reverend I would agree. However, an atheist reverend like me could be qualified for my vote."
The Cons heads would explode..
"Transplant to Georgia checking in...

Warnock would probably not be too interested in being Commander in Chief.

I don't see it happening, but if he won the primary I'd support him 100%."
"Not happening anyway.

A black person will very likely (unfortunately) not be allowed to be President (again) in my lifetime. 

If something were to happen that President Biden could not exercise his office, and VP Harris were to become President - even temporarily - imagine the hue and cry there would be.

I thought much the same when Mayor Pete Buttigieg was running for president as an openly gay man (full disclosure: I originally come from not far from South Bend, where he was Mayor; to me he's ""local boy makes good"").

There are still way too many troglodytes in this country."
No preacher president for me
Who wants this guy on the presidential ballot? As the incumbent he barely beat Herschel The Warewolf Walker. Democrats are going to have to be very deliberate with selecting candidates since there’s no such thing as a sure thing anymore.
People fighting me about this is classic.  They have no problem with a pastor of THEIR religion.  How privileged.
Calm down. The guy barely won a race that should have been a slam dunk. He’s not running for president.
"Personally, I don't find him to be presidential. I am very grateful that he didn't take the low road in his campaign against Walker when he certainly had opportunity. Being presidential is about diplomacy on a world stage. It's about being firm in dealing with the legislative branch and selecting responsible Judges. 

Warnock is green and seemingly naïve."
"Good gravy this seemed to tick of some fellow liberals.  At least we are not a cult.  Sorry you can’t see past your Xian beliefs to see how a reverend of a faith can seem troubling for some,of us.  How privileged."
So... one stupid MSNBC piece and you're gauging interest... but disagreeing with said piece? Seems like a reach.
"I mean, wanting a separation between Church & State should be normal. A fictional book with absolutely no tangible proof of anything remotely factual, shouldn't have any hold on real people's daily lives. We live in twilight zone reality, it's just normalized because it's all we know. Traditional ideology is what holds us back from our next evolution as a species.. it'll be what ends the human race in my opinion of course."
I won't speak specifically for Warnock but I wouldn't have a problem with a pastor running for president. Not all pastors are alike and there's no reason to believe that just because someone has served in that role they can't also uphold the Constitution and act in the best interest of the country.
"The extent to which religion instructs someone to apply dogma in their secular life varies by person and by creed.

I'd have more of a problem with a 'lay' person from LDS or People of Praise.  In both of those cases, members are instructed to carry out their religion's commands in all aspects of life, including working to proselytize and convert others.

As far as I can tell, Senator Warnock does not use his public service to attempt to enforce his beliefs on others, and does not belong to denomination that instructs him to do so."
I mean- does he believe in the separation of church and state? Does he believe in governing fairly and following laws? There’s a lot more to the conversation than his original career choice. I would choose a minister over the owner of a gun related saloon any day.
"Mike Pence was vice president, youre saying Warnock would be more jesusy and ridiculous?"
Thanks! Sentiment is the same!
I would as well.
People are saying he needs to run for President.  Happy to have him as our 51st vote in the Senate.
"Well of course any Dem over a GOP Fascist.  We don’t always get the Dem we want, but usually the Dem we deserve."
"Yes, a perfect and perhaps possible scenario. It’s really concerning.   I disagree with Romney’s views and he would not get my vote, but I have a serious issue with having a religious leader being the leader of USA.  It’s not how we were built or meant to be."
"Yes, it’s not so much Warnock, but the concept.  Imagine if he did run and win.  What does the GOP put up and what if/when they win?  We become a Christian Fascist nation."
"Guided by faith and having a job preaching the faith are 2 different things.  At least how I see it. Every president has been Xian, not every President has made a living be a Shepherd of his faith."
The potato nearly won
MSNBC was doing it today on deadline WH.
I would too over any MAGA but I sure would try and find an non company man of a religious dogma in the primaries so I would not have to make that choice.
"Wasn’t Obama President and black?  How young are you?  But yes, I don’t see how that happens again. The right will burn it down before they let that happen again."
MSNBC was walking it this afternoon.  It’s why I posted it to gage reaction.
It was MSNBC. So please don’t tell me to calm anything.
I’m so glad he is our 51st Senator for all the reasons you list!
"Religious liberty would necessarily include not disqualifying someone based on their religious involvement. 

Given the options from the other party, who gives a shit? Warnock is good stuff especially for American politics."
It not a reach when a major liberal news network floats the idea and I respond as a liberal who doesn’t think a pastor should be president.  I didn’t even need to stretch out prior to posting.
Where did I say that?  Re- read the part. The very 1st part.  Where I praise Sen Warnock.
">I have zero interest in having a person who was a Reverend

>*I'd vote Warnock.*

>I would as well.

Way to contradict yourself. Just say you don't like religion and go"
Agreed but an Atheist president would lose bad. You gotta at least lie and pretend to love jesus
"""People"" in general say that with just about any politician except for Ted Cruz"
Lol yea.  My point is that there were a lot of people who found reasons like this to sit out or vote third party in the 2016 cycle.  Now Roe v Wade is overturned and we’ll have a conservative majority SCOTUS for a couple decades at least.  So how’d that work out?
"I'm 54 and don't remember EVER getting the Dem I wanted. I'm not complaining, because that's how democracy works for most of us and I'm just thankful we live in a democracy."
"I agree. But I doubt we will ever see Romney get the repub nomination again. But there are plenty of other possibilities in the future, case in point, Mike Pence."
"Not if democrats and rational republicans keep participating in elections while shutting down religious extremists. 

We can hope the trend continues."
"That does depend on the individual and the culture of the congregation. Some are certainly in the business of marketing their church. Others simply see their role as shepherding their flock. The role of a pastor is mainly working on the outreach of the congregations mission work and visiting those in the church who are sick or shut ins. Sunday mornings and sermons get the attention, but is a relatively small portion."
"And really, isn’t that the scary thing."
That’s just them filling air time
Wow. This seems precipitous.
I should have said ANOTHER black president. I voted for Obama in 08 and 12.
Sheesh. There will be a president Comacho in my lifetime.
Barely winning in a faintly purple state is equivalent to a crushing win in a blue state.
"As a gay person who has had the church lead the way in oppression, I kinda give a shit.  Re-read my post. I like him, I don’t like religions leaders being president.  There is a difference.  And yes, of course Warnock is better than anything the GOP puts up, but that doesn’t force me to have to like his occupation or the previous company he worked at, and will always for for (the church)."
"I don’t like religion in the WH, but Xian vs MAGA… I will pick Xian.  And also, I’m staying. Don’t tell me to go anywhere, you sound like a Xian when do demand I do something to make you feel better."
I wish you weren't right
Trump - 'It's a bible'
"Spot on. And very few of the founding fathers were actually Christian in thought. Enlightenment was huge then. A lot of Deists. Now, someone has to hold a Bible to be POTUS. Sad. Backward."
Every President has been a Xian. Not one of them them earned a living preaching the word (if memory serves).  It’s a bit too much religion in the office already. Having a pro sitting in the chair doesn’t seem right for a country that touts religious liberty.
You have to pretend to be a Protestant - even being catholic counts against you.
"You can confuse them once in a while and just pronounce it Jeebuzz once in a while, but not every time."
Just like trump did!
"As much as I wish this weren't the case, it's true. I mean, Donald Trump wasn't a Christian before his presidential run and he's not a Christian now, but he was willing to lie about it, and the base ate that up. I would love a secular president, but we still live in a country where 40% of the population believes in Noah's Ark and that the Earth is only 6,000 years old, so I don't see a path to the white house for anyone that's openly atheist."
And thank God for that!  (Irony 100% intended here)
"Yup, I have always voted.  I would not vote for Warnock in the Primary.  And I would be very nervous to have a religious leader of any religion as President of the US.  Still better than a Nazi however.  It’s a sad choice if it came to that."
"I’m 52 here and Obama in 08 was the only time my primary pick actuality won the WH.  It’s the curse of being a Dem and not living in a cult of a party.  The more diversity the better, but that means my candidate doesn’t always win."
"Neither were working as a pastor.  Biden is VERY faithful, perhaps more that Pence or Romney.  None of those guys made a living as a Pastor. There is a distinction there for me.  It’s Rev Warnock job and life to bring those to the faith.  It’s in his job description.  How does he separate that in the WH?  How does the next person who may not have the great moral compass that Warnock does?"
Yup!  Lol
"I'm not, but the condescension towards religion is one reason the right is able to capture so many voters.

>I don’t like religion in the WH,

Bro WHAT? We have NEVER had a non-religious president. I would like it change too but in the short term it's a pretty unrealistic thing to hope for."
"What is your favorite passage, sir? <caught flat footed> Well that's very personal to me. 
Do you like the new or the Old Testament? 
I like both testaments the same. The Old Testament it's just that it's so... old. Where the New Testament is so much... newer."
"I get your concern, but I would not assume an atheist president would attempt to impose their beliefs on anyone. Why do you assume this man would?"
Garfield was a minister for an organization called the Disciples of Christ. It's a little more complicated than that. But he did a lot of lobbying for them. It's actually a really interesting dive.
Biden is catholic.
"I realize my examples aren't religious leaders but I don't really feel there would be any difference between just being devout and actually being a religious leader, currently or previously. I doubt they would separate it.

The reason I bring up Romney and Pence, is because of their brand of religion they choose to subscribe to, if you will. I doubt they would have any problem signing a law that disadvantaged groups in support of others. Pence actually did about a decade ago as Governor of Indiana."
">It’s Rev Warnock job and life to bring those to the faith.  It’s in his job description. 

No it's not. He's a reverend, not a missionary. His job is to live in accordance with the words of Christ, and to encourage others who are already wanting to do that. He is not paid to proselytise, and despite what Dominionists such as Pence will tell you, the Bible not only says nothing against abortion, it gives instructions for a priest to perform one. 

Pence, as a Dominionist, wants to instigate a theocracy to force his religion, particularly chastity, bigotry and anti-abortion beliefs on every woman in America, severely damaging the health, privacy, and independence of women. 

Warnock has not pushed any religion or laws based on religious ideas, and he's representing a party which would not vote in agreement with any efforts to impose religion-based restrictions."
The fact that he is a successful Democrat to me means he has separated religion from his senator duties.
The condescending attitude of religious folks on my life is what drove me away from the church. I guess what comes around goes around. We literally just passes a law which carves out legal religious bigotry and we all cheered.  God Bless America
“I don’t like religion in the WH” I should clarify that.  A religious LEADER in the WH.  I get that we are a primary Xian country and ALL our presidents have been Xian.  I just don’t need a preacher in that role.
Two corinthians
"Eh, to be fair one of those has a loooooooong history of trying to impose their will on others, the other one id be interested in some examples bc I haven't really seen any significant ones. 

History counts."
"It’s his job?  That is what a pastor does.  Every president has been religious, not every president made a living being religious."
An atheist would impose their non belief.
He has…will the next?  Religious leaders should not run the country.  I don’t understand why everyone seems like I’m being extreme here.
"Is that more than a brasillion, said Trump, maybe... Probably"
"I don’t wanna be that guy but 

Stalin literally did this"
"That is because it isnt newsworthy to discuss the actions of religious organizations that simply carry out their creed of love. Once Oral Roberts told the world that God said he would die unless his church received 6 million dollars, the world only gets updates on the charlatans. I'm certainly not perfect by any definition of the word, but I wont be a member of a congregation that isnt mission oriented first and foremost. 

And I completely understand why you feel the way you do. But I would challenge you to do some searching. There are wonderful things done across this country simply because there are people who are trying to fulfill the teaching of their faith. Jim and Tammy Faye Baker notwithstanding."
"Imposing your beliefs is not a pastors job. It is to lead worship and to harness the faith of the congregation to do the outreach that is described in the stories of the Bible, Quran, Torah, etc. 

I do understand why people think that way because so many out there are doing it for the profitability and the prestige of the position."
I know but that still counts against them - why - because people keep mentioning it - it’s a way the more mainstream religions in the US try to say - he’s not like us.
I don’t necessarily disagree with you. I just think it will be hard to get a good candidate who is also separated strongly from religion. I don’t know the stat but isn’t there a pretty high % of believers of some sort in the US? I myself am a fallen Catholic so there’s that.🤷🏻‍♀️
"Lol I'll look into it. I wasn't kidding, I'm interested. My main point stands that one side has a significantly more prolific history of trying to force their religion on others. That being said more information is always better, even if it's not what I expect, like or agree with. So I appreciate it."
"I didn't say churches never do good things, I said they have a very long history of trying to do impose their will on others."
It’s all I have ever seen the American Christian church do is impose its beliefs. Why would I think otherwise?
"I should be clear, I understand that most (if not all) presidents have had strong Christian believes (Ahem…Trump, not so much).  I don’t have an issue with that nearly as strong as I do with someone who is an actual Pastor of the Church.  Going to pray on Sunday is one thing as a US President.  Leading the prayer is a whole new thing for our Democracy that I’m just not comfortable with.  There is a difference.  Even if Sen Warnock would lead a great, liberal, inclusive prayer like Jesus taught, I just don’t think that is the job of the President and I don’t see how someone could serve both."
"They are not all like that.  Some lead to faith, not impose it.

Its the difference between religion and actual faith.

With that said, I do not want a preacher as president.  Even if they didn't cross those paths, it would blur lines which need to be clear."
That just means you have a narrow view of pastors.
So I would expect he would have to give up his job as reverend. This is an interesting thought you posted here and got me thinking. I think I too would not want a reverend as president ultimately but would take this particular one over any Republican any day of the week.🤣
They have a narrow view of me.  I like Jesus. It’s his followers I have an issue with.
"Yes, Warnock is actually not the problem, it’s the standard that is set.   Watching a GOP Reverend being elected after him the scary moment."
"As a Christian, I think that is reasonable. Just do know that some of us take his teaching to heart even when it is inconvenient to our cultural norms."
"So what you're afraid of is not Warnock, it's the slippery slope. 

I don't believe Warnock being President, if that were to happen, would affect the likelihood of a future president being a religious leader one way or another."
"Yes, it’s not Warnock. I said that 1st. I called him great and he is.  But I do think this scenario would be taken advantage of by the GOP."
"Republicans have a history of electing rather stupid people. Bush jr, Walker (both Scott and Herschel), Trump, Perry, Palin, MTG, Boebert, Bachmann"
They spew what they hear on Fox News. I battle with these people constantly.
I would argue Trump and Walker are of equal intelligence.
Conservatives are brainwashed.  They will vote for literally anyone with an R next to their name.  Once someone tells you they’re a right winger you don’t need to talk to them anymore.  You can hear all their opinions on Fox News.
Sounds like you need a new roommate
"No one voted for Walker because they thought he'd be a good Senator, they voted for him because they wanted a Republican Senate. So your roommate was simply being honest: he wants a fascist America.   

The part about Warren was just second hand trolling. They hate and fear her because they know she's smart."
Do you need help finding a new roommate?
"Most of my adult life I was an Independent voter. I voted for the individual and not the party.  Grant it that this turn out to be almost always a Democrat or Independent but not always. Now I would not vote for a Republican no matter how good they were because the current Republican Party is anti-democracy and a danger to the country. It does not matter if the individual is honorable and with good intentions. Look to what happened to Cheney. The party decides the agenda and the individual has little to no power. Voting for any Republican gives power to people like Greene, Jordan, Goser, etc. I will not do that."
The power of propaganda will make weak minded people believe anything.
Anyone willing to vote for Hershel Walker is not a serious person.
it's perfectly acceptable to not respect really dumb people saying stupid things
"Fox News has perfected their strategy of getting people who know nothing about politics to vote Republican. They exploit their fear, insecurity, and inadequacy in the most subtle ways. Just a constant subtle drone of “these democrats are at it again, trying to take away your money/way of life/racial superiority, but YOU know better. You are smart. And you’d be much more successful if the democrats weren’t constantly giving away your money and opportunities to OTHERS”"
"Breaking dichotomous thinking, a known trait of Republican voters, is extremely difficult. It often requires a disorienting experience, therapy, or both."
Democrats are so demonized with propaganda that conservatives would rather vote for Satan (R) than anyone with (D)
"Cult members will not compromise and clearly will also vote for unqualified over qualified if that is what their party machinery has drummed up. Getting their way is more important to them than respecting the fundamental principles of democracy.  
Note the astounding level of lunacy and non-sequitur they are willing to swallow in order to maintain their detachment from actual reality."
Elizabeth Warren is absolutely brilliant. Your roommate is a dipshit.
I’d be looking for a new roommate. And I’d really interview them about their world view before deciding.
"Ask him why.  

They usually start with the fiscally responsible economy but can never articulate why Democrats a better exonomy every time they've held office for the last 40 years.  Public policy?  Republicans don't have any policy other than saying no to anything that helps citizen and interfering in private lives.  Military?  Sure thing!  Unless it involves taking care of the actual people who serve/served.  Save the unborn?  Ok.  Then what about after they're born or providing assistance to the women/girls forced to carry them?"
"Have you forgotten about Sarah Palin? 

I jest, but, my god, the first time I heard that idiot speak...I just..no words can describe how unbelievably stupid she sounded. It was pure incomprehensible, word salad."
They really do swallow all the fox news talking points and then vomit them back out at whoever isn't on their team. No critical thinking involved whatsoever
"In fairness, if the situation were reversed I would still vote for the unqualified Democrat because it helps give more power to all the very qualified Democrats.  I don't care if he's sitting in a corner sucking his thumb, if he votes to support everything I agree with then he's better than putting a Republican in there who will be against everything I stand for. 

That said, the problem for me isn't that they'd vote for him, the problem is that he's the one they chose to run in the first place.  I wouldn't ever need to make that choice (voting for someone unqualified) because that doesn't happen nearly as often on the Left, because we don't build our identities and campaigns around fake non-issues like whether a trans kid can use a bathroom.  Our side is like ""We need targeted tax credits to alleviate childhood poverty"" and their side is like ""If kids read the wrong book they'll dress in chipmunk costumes and fuck bags of kale!""

 As others have pointed out, the list of unarguably ignorant and demagoguing Republicans is long.  Even someone like Cruz - who is not stupid - is willing to play the fool and go along with all the stupid, false talking points that whip up their base."
"If the roles reversed, would you vote for Herschel and lose that seat?"
"Let me preface this by saying that what I saw of Walker speaking was absolutely pathetic. But this: 
  
>“So an esteemed law professor and prolific author is an idiot?”

Is also just about as meaningless as the gibberish analogies and parables Walker was trying to say.  

Getting a degree and excelling in a narrow and particular area of law does not mean that you're overly intelligent, or even that you necessarily make good decisions. Even getting published isn't all that difficult, lots of stuff that's either erroneous, poorly thought out, or already well known gets published every year.    
An example from Warren's work:  
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Warren
>According to Warren and economists who follow her work, one of her key insights was that rising bankruptcy rates were caused not by profligate consumer spending but by middle-class families' attempts to buy homes in good school districts  
  
So they decided the bankruptcies they examined  weren't from excessive consumption, *they were from buying nicer homes than they could afford*. Which is still a form of excessive consumption because it is still living beyond your means, and I'd wager that if you dig into their data the same people likely also had excessive credit card debt from trying to cover other expenses, like some consumer goods, because the money which would normally cover some of them was being eaten up by their excessive mortgages.  
In the real world bankruptcies are virtually never from a single cause, they are instead usually the result of emergencies tipping over years of accumulated poor financial decisions.
 In 1989 when Warren and her coauthors published their book nobody but those in academia would have found the idea that people were overextending themselves to buy in better neighborhoods surprising, even the politicians talking about overconsumption probably knew that, I certainly did because I knew people who had done it and I was barely old enough to buy beer."
"The fact that most people here continue to call him a cultist is unsettling. You can vote for a strategic majority and still oppose whatever a politician individually intends to do.

I often voted red when the subject at hand was taxes and national security. I understood that an abortion ban was something that the party would forever offer to the crazies but never really go for when it came to legislating.

It wasn’t until elections became about the functioning of our democracy that I stopped voting Republican (the moment Trump won the nomination). And now I am literally voting, strategically, for any Democrat simply because I’d like to keep our democracy in somewhat working order."

"Ah… this is difficult to dig into… but easy to spot. Easy to dismiss, difficult to explain…

But oh so difficult to build that hope and support to choose better during elections.

I contend that it’s primarily related to poor education and/or sheltered conservative upbringing or compounded by both.

The world view that many Republicans hold is the very core of their identity. What they talk about, what they listen, what they see, what they support - all feeds into how they think and process things… which then factors into their decision making. 

If all they have known is conservative values, possibly religious maybe orthodox, fed constantly by Newsmax and Fox News that America is wronging them, constantly feeding on rhetoric from Bannon or Alex Jones or the likes, they have shut themselves out of knowing other possibilities. 

The intellectual vacuum is important for them to safeguard their identity and way of living. Shaking any pillar that supports that identity is a non-starter because they hold all such pillars to be unquestionable axioms.

Therefore it’s unconscionable for them to even begin considering alternatives. It’s all black and white, their way or the highway.

"my uncle is an evangelical christian and said he supported walker over warnock, despite warnock being a pastor, simply because walker opposes abortion. 

my uncle isn't a dumb man, he's actually very intelligent in many ways, but he is terribly mislead and fixated on a few issues. on certain topics, like abortion, he refuses to budge whatsoever."

"If they want to go after people Ad Hominem as their only strategy, or only repeat nonsensical talking points, then they aren’t trying to argue with you.

Treat these people like you would any other idiot trying to make you angry: Whenever he mentions politics, ignore him and belittle his insults by not giving them any of your attention. As an added bonus it will make them angry that you aren’t willing to engage, and could give you a valid reason to get them kicked out such as harassment or verbal abuse."
"Remember this when they attack the character of a Democrat.  They wanna have their cake and eat it too - they wanna argue that the character of Democrats matter, but the character of Republicans don't.

Republicans seem to know better than Democrats nowadays that party matters waaay more then the individual politician.  Which is annoyingly why that dishonest Republican tactic works sometimes.  I wish we'd wise up on this, and unify a little more."

Your roommate actually has a brain of his own and doesn’t listen to MSM religiously. Good for him
"Your roommate is smart.  Walker may not be the brightest, but when you look at the miserable failures of Democrats all over the country, logical people don't want anything to do with them.  Warren, once a smart, respected politician, has evolved into the left wing, idiot she is today.  Not quite on the AOC level of stupidity, but close.  Democrats generally appeal to the less educated and easily influenced people in the US so compromising is difficult.  They're guided by a corrupt media that capitalizes on this and fuels the division."

"I mean, you could ask the same of yourself.

_""What would it take for make me vote for a Republican candidate?""_

I feel like for most people here (most people on Reddit even) the answer is _""Obviously nothing, because even voting for a bad Democrat candidate is better than voting for a good Republican""_, which is a perfectly understandable position.

That's just how politics works - often you support the general goals of the political party rather than the individual qualities of the candidate.

That's exactly what your roommate is doing - he probably supports broad Republican policies, so voting for Walker just means more votes in congress for those. He's not expecting much from Walker himself other than providing his votes."
"Three cheers for tribalism. Some people either don’t know any better, or don’t have enough self esteem to be comfortable questioning and discussing issues individually. There is nothing wrong with being uninformed or lacking understanding, so long as you are curious. Nobody knows everything.

Pew Research has validated the claim that higher levels of education correlate to liberal voting inclination.

Except that's not really your roommate's position. Their position is that they'd rather have the CTE guy who will vote in the direction they want to go (Republican) than any Democrat because they won't. It's not about fit, quite frankly, neither Walker nor Warren are fit for different reasons, it's about who is going to vote for the things they want and who isn't."

Hope she is fine. Politicians' children are outside issues.
I read that his daughter came out as bi. If this is true it's easy to connect the dots. It's difficult growing up LGBT in America... even more so when you live in a conservative area AND have conservative parents. I feel really bad for her.
Whoever it was I hope that they get good medical and psychological care. If it was his daughter I can only imagine what it would be like to be the daughter of Ted Cruz
Knowing what I know about Ted Cruz he's going to somehow only coldly and robotically make the situation worse. Poor girl.
No child should have to suffer as the child of Ted Cruz. Honestly Hope they’re ok. Having such a disposed father probably doesn’t make being their child easy. I assume bullying probably played a part which is a bigger problem world wide honestly.
"All the ""I'm center right"" folks getting riled up. 

THIS IS POLITICS

If you're calling LGBT folks groomers, aiming to take away their civil rights, etc... Then the results of your cruelty politics will also be viewed through a political lens."
"I hope the child is doing better.  I also hope Ted realizes this is the by product of republican hate politics.  Dead kids.  Thank goodness his child isn't among that number.

Christians whine but the reality is LGBTQ+ have a much more brutal time of it than they can ever dream of."
"I'm surprised Ted isn't using his family for political clout....or maybe he is, I have been at work all day, so not sure."
"Considering that Cruz exposed his kids to national scorn as an excuse for him going to Cancun when his Texas constituents were freezing their asses off as their energy grid collapsed, it’s no wonder we’re seeing such stories. Honestly, it’s probably appropriate for child welfare officials to storm the home and take them out before they suffer additional permanent damage."
Is it not obvious that Ted Cruz abuses his children?
"They say no serious injuries, but of course, they don't consider lgbtq people attempting to commit suicide to be a *serious* issue so..."

"If I were schoolmates with her, I'd befriend her for sure. She's exactly the girl in school who parties the most, has the best drugs & when you're with her, suffers the least amount of consequences.

"We should be able to call some LGBT folks groomers though just like we should be able to call some straight folks groomers. If they are doing grooming, I'll call them groomers. If they aren't, I won't. Most of time people use that word, they are talking about specific instances of grooming. What, are we not supposed to call out those people?

Also, taking away what civil rights? Almost all of us  on the center right support LGBT marriage. I'm not seeing anybody trying to repeal it. I've vocally advocated for it since I was a kid and many of my moderate right wing or classical liberal friends have done the same."
"That is not appropriate. Teenagers have a difficult time no matter what family they are in. Cruz seems to be a piece of shit to most people, but normal in his family life so we should not be cruel to his family."
True but not his kids.
"This isn't about his child, most here hope she is getting better care because she's better than her father. It's about the situation and how it's caused by people like her father. And hoping him and the rest wake up to see that.
It's posted here cause a politicians house had a self injured child."
"No, this is exactly why politics matters. This man and his cohorts vilifiy lgbtq people at every turn. This highlights the real world consequences of that kind of campaign. They’ve spent an awful lot of time, money and energy categorizing these people as less deserving of dignity and legal protections as everyone else…this result plays out time and again in families all over this country."
"Agreed. Full disclosure, I'm center-right, but I'd like to see people on both sides respect that this is a human being going through her own trauma, likely for reasons entirely unrelated to her father.

The right tried to micromanage Obama's parenting, and that was also uncalled for. The left won't win any points with me or others in the center or moderate right by bashing Cruz over this. Be the bigger man here, and just wish that kid well."
"Yep. Republicans are assholes.

"Yeah but when you get caught doing shit, she gets off and you don’t."
I didn’t say how he was as a father. I’m sure he’s a good dad. He cares enough to take his kids on vacation to get them out of the cold. I get it. I did say he was not well liked and knowing how kids can be it’s possible his kids got bullied. Bold of you to assume it’s all an act though.
"By labeling all LGBTQ+ folks groomers, then it dilutes the term."
Hey everyone! Check out this willfully-ignorant twit!

Ehhhh…I agree with your overall sentiment, but [he doesn’t seem like a great, normal guy](https://youtu.be/-d99XOOLqRM) in his personal sphere either.

And like isn’t the pitch for conservative ideology that they have perfect family lives? If this had happened in a Democrat’s family, Republicans would be ree-ing over the decline of the American family."
"You mean “Yeah, my wife is ugly” Ted Cruz? You mean the guy who blamed his daughters for not being there as the Texas “Freedom” Power grid melted down? Usually guys simp for pretty girls, but I rarely see a woman simp for an ugly (inside and out) guy"
"Bash Cruz all you want.  call him a terrible parent, but leave his private relatives out of it.  We can fight like hell for our principles without losing human decency and empathy.  That's what separates us from them."
"Ya, a bi kid struggling in a household where Dad calls all LGBT people groomers is for sure 100% unrelated. The cruelty of Republican politics has consequences."
"Yea.  Bash Cruz, or Warnock or Biden or Trump, all you want.  They are public figures, and we can argue their choices, including lifestyle choices, IMO, on the basis of the facts.  Children, siblings and parents of public figures who choose not to make their lives public, we should respect that."
I can’t imagine how hard that would be. Growing up feeling like you’re living a lie. Only to accept who you are and still have to live a lie.
Depends on your definition of therapy.
"ah, true. She'd probably roll on me quickly too."
"It's also equally possible they never get bullied and are well liked kids at school.  Bottom line, neither of us know so that's the only fact here. 

Personally I hope all is okay same holds for anyone having kids go thru something like this.  Imo, I think w things like this it's healthy to park partisan politics at the back door.  There is a lot more going on in life other than how a person votes.  Not directed at you yet it's sad how many folks have forgotten what compassion is."
"Yeah, heard a story about Texas state police found his wife crying on the side of the interstate several years ago so I doubt he's a peach to live with."
They are certainly making a lot of Biden’s kids issues that’s for sure. It’s not nice when they do it either.
"Don’t get me wrong. I feel immensely for this child. But considering who her father is, it puts a necessary spotlight on the horrendous way many in the Republican Party talk about and treat our fellow Americans who are members of the lgbtq community. That kind of talk has real consequences and nobody is immune from experiencing those consequences. My criticism is fully with me Cruz and his ilk."
"so, while we respect that - the GOP openly says they'll be making the primary focus of the House of Representatives the exact opposite - - sounds like the liberal catch-22 rearing its ugly head again"
"That is more or less how my friend described it.

I had no idea."
"I hadn’t heard that story.

Here’s a [BuzzFeed News article](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/mckaycoppins/the-trials-and-triumphs-of-heidi-cruz) on it. Apparently she struggled with depression after quitting her job and moving Texas."
"your ""both sides"" nonsense is far less appropriate than pointing out that the Cruz children's welfare should be protected"
"Yeah, like dying of brain cancer after serving in Iraq. How utterly immoral left wing snowflake of Beau."
"yea, that's my point.  This is sensationalized reporting that serves noone.  It's also not politics.  This is the private health struggle of one person, and none of us would want strangers on the internet dissecting our health like that.  I think we should extend the same empathy to this young person that we extend to anyone who does not wish to be in the public eye and just leave them alone.

and maybe make a donation to the trevor project in Ted's name."
"How so? 

Not necessarily disagreeing, just looking for elaboration"
At least they have a friend like you.
Forgot where I heard it but it was kinda like the current situation in that it seemed to be covered up quickly.
I try. I still have a lot to learn.
"When I got out of the military I moved into a small 4-plex one of the people living there was trans. We became friends I adored her, but had no idea until she got some mail with her old name on it. It sounds insane I didn’t know but I had never met a trans person. It’s probably a good thing I didn’t know at first because I would had some false and harsh preconceived notions about her. Ultimately we became even closer friends, she became a lawyer that represents lgbtq+ people almost exclusively. I admire her so much. 

Being a straight white man I’ll never understand the lifestyle or challenges associated with it but I will always do my best to be an ally. I think that’s the best we can do. 

You sound like a good friend and ally."
"Thank you.

I'm an old military guy as well."
"04-08, USS Haley DDG97 out of San Diego. 

How about you?"
"122nd Tactical Fighter Wing, Indiana Air National Guard, Fort Wayne, Indiana"
That’s awesome! Thank you for your service.
You too

>>*He's never had to reckon with it before!*

Well.  The Times They Are A-Changin' (paraphrased from the great poet and Nobel Laureate - and one of my favorite humans - Bob Dylan).  

Thank goodness!

The Times They Are A-Changin [here](https://youtu.be/90WD_ats6eE).

Come gather 'round people

Wherever you roam

And admit that the waters

Around you have grown

And accept it that soon

You'll be drenched to the bone

If your time to you is worth savin'

And you better start swimmin'

Or you'll sink like a stone

For the times they are a-changin'

Come writers and critics

Who prophesize with your pen

And keep your eyes wide

The chance won't come again

And don't speak too soon

For the wheel's still in spin

And there's no tellin' who

That it's namin'

For the loser now

Will be later to win

For the times they are a-changin'


Come senators, congressmen

Please heed the call

Don't stand in the doorway

Don't block up the hall

For he that gets hurt

Will be he who has stalled

The battle outside ragin'

Will soon shake your windows

And rattle your walls

For the times they are a-changin'

Come mothers and fathers

Throughout the land

And don't criticize

What you can't understand

Your sons and your daughters

Are beyond your command

Your old road is rapidly agin'

Please get out of the new one

If you can't lend your hand

For the times they are a-changin'


The line it is drawn

The curse it is cast

The slow one now

Will later be fast

As the present now

Will later be past

The order is rapidly fadin'

And the first one now

Will later be last

For the times they are a-changin'

"And after hearing all he owes after being found guilty of criminal tax fraud is $1.6 million or the equivalent of $5 to your average person, it sounds like he's winning. What a joke the legal system is in the US."
"It's all coming to light now.

The __demagogic temerity__ of pugnacious, narcissistic, and want-to-be fascist dictator / defeated grifter and one term former President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice)__ and the imbroglio he has foisted upon our country *knows no bounds.* Guilty __(at the very least) of extreme direlection of duty, his cognitive dissonance __moves forward unchecked.__

>*So here’s a clue as to why Donald Trump did not want anyone reading his individual tax returns. His company has just been convicted of criminal fraud for evading taxes on benefits paid to executives. The accused was Trump’s company, not Trump himself. Nor was Trump one of the executives accused of evasion. Yet the jeopardy to Trump personally is very near and very real.*

The prosecutor knew they had a good case. And pursued it.

>*New York State’s prosecutors asserted at trial that Trump had explicitly approved the evasion scheme: “This is all part of the Trump executive compensation package. Free cars for you, free cars for your wife, free apartments for you, free apartments for your kids. apartments for you, free apartments for your kids. Why not pay them more? Because it would cost them double to give them raises rather than give them the cars on the down-low.”*

There is so much more on the horizon, of course. He can run, but he can't hide.

>*The jury’s verdicts cast light on a series of related questions that now loom large.*

>*Why did Trump fight all the way to the Supreme Court to conceal his individual tax returns from scrutiny?*

>*Why did Trump make such a priority of personal control of the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Justice, given his general lack of concern with the mechanics of government?*

>*Why was Trump willing to commit impeachable offenses in his effort to win the election of 2020, and then even more and worse impeachable offenses to hold on to power in 2021 after his defeat?*

The narcissistic sociopath, __unhinged insurrectionist,__ and grifter (with a pronounced case of logorrhea) known as one term twice impeached former President Trump, has a pattern of explaining, excusing, deflecting and blaming others for the circumstances he finds himself in."
My thoughts? I wonder if fantasizing about shooting the president to the point where they shoot at a cardboard cutout would be considered a threat to his life legally?
Take a picture of the bullet rides Biden cutout and send it to the Secret Service.
"I had to cut off all friends who are rabid Trumpers because the stress of being around them was unbearable. If they want to support (worship) him, that's fine. Unfortunately, most want to sing his praises and try to prove to you how great he is by repeating one crackpot 'fact' after another. My 3 sisters adored the Apprentice show and are all Trumpers. I told them that the moment his name is brought up in a conversation that I will leave. We rarely talk. I've made it very clear how I feel about Trump and the idiocy that was his presidency. As the Republicans get more threatening and crazy, I won't talk politics with any of them at all."
"I like the way you're thinking strategically. My concern is that the bad behavior has no limits. It gives permission to others to act badly and snowballs out of control. An example is Nazi Germany and now we see Russia going the same way.

If we let it go unchecked, we'll find ourselves having to defend ourselves with force. It might be better to make ourselves more attractive than encouraging them to get uglier.

But again, I like how you think!"
Please don't insult me by praising Chump and using a likeness of President Biden. Can we agree not to discuss our opposing political views in the name of family peace? Insulting others is rude.
No good answers to this. Better to just stay away. Definitely don’t encourage bad behavior. Independents see it plenty anyway. Don’t poke a beast unless you want to fight.
"My thoughts? Yes, let them think we are upset so they continue being nasty.

Years ago before I left Twitter, there was a hashtag #OpLetThemSpeak. It was tongue-in-cheek humor about the awful thing they said. But today, a few years later, it's become apparent that the awful things they say cost Republicans elections.

In the recent midterms, Democrats decided to put money into the most extreme candidates in the Republican primaries because they felt that an extremist would be easier to beat than a moderate. Pundits at the time warned that this was a risky strategy, but it paid off handsomely. Every single extremist candidate that they backed in the primaries went on to lose in the general election.

People are turned off by hate speech, bullying, and bigotry, more importantly voters are turned off by those things. We have the opportunity to do some branding here, let's make the Republican ""brand"" a brand of extremism, hatred, bullying, and bigotry."
"I'm so sick of the childish, selfish and downright untenable position of these assholes.  Nothing you say can change them from acting like cult members.  Trump is losing his grip with Republicans so they'll probably jump to the more popular DeSantis side to stay on ""the winning team.""  Wait for the backpeddling to begin."
">Instead, I thought it would be better to express my discust at their behavior because we don't want them to moderate. 

???

I absolutely want them to moderate."
"Radicalize the Republicans!!! >:] And we shall be dominant, and then our liberal snowflake agenda shall in bed into the heads of America!!! >:D yesh"
"Doubtful.
Gun ranges sold Obama targets by the gross nationally.."
"They only told me about the cut-out as they bragged about their shooting range so I didn't see it and I imagine it would be a free speech issue.   
Per the agreement several years ago, we are not supposed to talk about politics among the family, this was their most obvious violation of that rule.   


My question was really about how whether we should encourage them to continue to be assholes, or show them the folly of their ways?"
"As an old lady who voted GOP a few times in her long life, heard how badly Obama was talked about, detested Trump for over 6 decades, I will never vote GOP again, and I did break off any “friendships” I had with Trumpers. You will NOT change their mind with facts, figures or reality. It truly is a cult."
"Yeah, my problem is, the moderate republicans did ok in the midterm, and they are complacent when it comes to speaking out against the extreme asshole trump behavior. 

Using your nazi analogy, it was the fact that a lot of moderate parties were willing to allow the nazi's to hold/gain power (they only got 37% of the vote in 1937, so they had to form a coalition with other parties to hold power). Had the Nazis made clear they're willingness gas chamber millions of Jews, maybe a lot of the moderate parties would not have backed them. We let the trump supports show their willingness to shoot politicians they don't like, and the moderate center of America wouldn't let them have too much power"
"My simple instinct wants them to moderate, but strategically, it would be better for the democrats in 2024 if they don't."
Good point. It’s not like we have a legal system that works anyway.
"I guess I’m the wrong person to give an answer to that if I’m honest.

I lost patience with the people like this (family and friends) awhile ago. It reached a boiling part almost exactly a year ago today and I cut off contact with them. I will say it has been a tremendous boon to my mental and emotional health."
"Same issue here with friends and family.

I dont poke at that beehive anymore... 
When trump is sentenced I plan to do this:
https://youtu.be/Auxn2VAdiKI

And send them this:
https://youtu.be/kdOPBP9vuZA"
Agreed!
"You're right. The cowardly complacent allowed the maga ugly to come to and stay in power. Thankfully, enough of the fence sitters this midterm saw the grass on that side was foul."
"My first concern is the health of our democracy. While I'm a lifelong liberal, I also firmly believe in the two-party system. If I had my wish, the GOP would find a new platform and begin providing constructive checks and balances again.

We don't want a unitary state and the way things are right now is dangerous. I'm happy that Democrats are regaining lost power, but I don't want absolute control. Playing games with fascists is dangerous and so I'll continue criticizing them until they start acting rational, again."
"Cutting people like that out of your life is self care. 

I haven’t talked to 2/3rds of my family in 10-15 years and I’m no worse off for it."
It’s a good start but I’m disappointed that 16 years of tax fraud only means up to $1.6m in fines. Surely they profited way more than that.
"It's nice to see this happened! I am crossing my fingers this will continue to expand. Get all of Trump's people, then take him out!"
Bit by bit I hope they take his wealth and put it into more useful places. Hopefully in his lifetime
*Trumps hopefuly next to be found guilty and then hopefuly he will go to ADX Florence Super Max Prison in Florence Colorado.*
"Now…what are odds people read the article and see the details and not just the headline??? 

I’ll sum it up, no your wish didn’t come true. A handful of top executives were found guilty and Donald was not charged with any of it. But the headline reads well…this is why you do t name company with your own name lol."
This is just the beginning
Finally!
"This is where my pessimism comes poking out. In what universe is there justice when a person will never be held to any kind of accountability for any of his long and lengthening history of likely crimes? This proves to me that no matter what they go after, they will always let him off the hook. 

What head of any organization who is convicted of *serious* tax fraud just walks away from it?  I thought ENRON set the standard to say that the C Suite cannot just say they didn't know what was going on. There is no real justice out there for people who are not rich, powerful, or both. We all suffer to scrap and scrape and are held to standards that these people are simply immune to.

I'm sure someone out there can tell me the legal reasons that he is not accountable and the myriad of excuses afforded to him and his ilk... but I just don't care to hear it. However you want to apologize for our legal system, it is simply broken."
Why is the fine so damn low. This just screams “keep doing it.”
"Consequences probably a fine which Trump Carrie’s in his wallet, here’s my platinum card now leave me alone."
Democrats have spent a fortune of tax payers’ money to incriminate Trump just to land a possible maximum fine of 1.6 million. Another L as usual for the left
"So if you read the article. The headline is misleading. This guy Weisselberg worked for trump as a financial adviser, didn't pay personal taxes on some assets and they charged 2 of trumps organizations that the guy worked for. The only information I have is from the CNN website."
All of this for less than $2 million. Waste of my eyes to bother reading about this. Talk to me when our AG grows a spine
1.6m in fine. Lol. That's like charging a regular citizen $16 for tax fraud. That'd never happen though.
"Very small fines and Trump had nothing to do with it, just in name, as per the rulings."
"Not to mention if I committed tax fraud in a much lower scale. Not only would I be fined, but I’d go to prison. Of course here they would never even imagine sending trump to prison. Just a slap on the wrist and off you go."
"its not the fine that is the point, its now trump org essentially cannot work with certain big institutions due to the label of being a fraud.

The other dominoes will hurt them even more and make them regret making a stake in new york city, possibly destroying his empire"
Gotta have wealth to distribute to do that
This stops loans. He can no longer launder funds through Trump org as easily now and is about to hit the harder lawsuit let alone the  other states and Federal charges. This was step one finally.
His ass will say he’s broke af
Like sending it to the Ukraine and/or funding transphobia awareness out in the Middle East
Just saw the finale last night 😭
"I read the article.  And while Trump wasn't individually charged, he was explicitly ""in the know.""  The defense argument that Trump knew nothing was thoroughly refuted.

But you're right about one thing, though: Trump won't face any real consequences (though I'm not sure why anyone thinks that is a \*good\* thing)."
"A lot of people already knew he wouldn't have been charged with anything and wouldn't have had to pay much if he was. It was all over the news. But it's not as if this isn't good news for multiple reasons:

1. Guilty on all counts proves a non-biased jury CAN be found.
2. This emboldens all the other district attorneys, DoJ attorneys, etc., and helps quell the ""We'll never get him, so we shouldn't even try"" Eeyore bullshit that hamstrings investigations and prosecutions. 
3. It was proven he did know, so now the IRS can come after him.
4. Banks will now be much less apt to loan him any money.
5. Other agencies involved in real estate may sanction the company. I don't know what licenses or approvals are needed to build buildings, but this and the other suits will likely make at least some of those agencies less apt to give him any benefit of any doubt. 
6. He lost. SEVENTEEN times. He hates losing. Yes, I have schadenfreude."
Yes!  Also sad that it’s the end of 2022 and it’s just the beginning.  Good grief!  LOL
Nope. Not just a fine. Banks will be less apt to loan him money now. IRS can come after him. And other attorneys and agencies going after him are emboldened now.
Is “cannot work with certain big institutions” really a problem though? There will always be pro-trump companies willing to support.
They still haven't got passed the homophobic part yet.
*Its nowhere near over yet.*
Really emboldened the civil lawsuit.
Awesome. But it should not have been this close.  Republicans should learn that quality of candidates matter.  I’m assuming next time they will just run a Stapler against him. But knowing Republicans it will soon be revealed that it was Hitlers Stapler
"It's shameful this race was as close as it was. Walker was put forth as a Republican candidate only because he was black. But black voters are not stupid & did not fall for this embarrassing #Oki-Doke candidate who is, as #Chapelle said, ""observedly stupid""!"
"Can the Senate rollback Rule 22 to the pre-1975 wording and kill the ""silent filibuster""?"
Why was it this close?
Or... and hear me out..... America needs some drastic election reforms to correct the gerrymandering and voter suppression that the GOP engage in so that they can remain competitive.
It's observably and what is with those hashtags?
"We need a LOT of reforms, including doing away with the bloody Electoral College.

However...many of those reforms require a constitutional amendment, and there are far too many with a vested interest in the status quo."
And christo-fascists are lousy tippers.
"TL:DR, the restaurant did to the church exactly what the church wants to do to LGBT. 

Per the Church . . .  They somewhat admitted they went there to start shit with the LGBTQ friendly nature of the place. No mater what the restaurant did it was going to end badly. These a-holes literally want to be able to exclude LGBTQ+ from the public places, public spaces, and existing at all.  (It all on there hateful website)

Per the Restaurant  

“The reservation was for an event with supporters to inform them further about the Family Foundation [FF], Cobb said,” the Examiner also informed. “A total of 15-20 people, consisting of the guests and some staff members, were meant to be in attendance.”

The restaurant later explained itself. “We have always refused service to anyone for making our staff uncomfortable or unsafe and this was the driving force behind our decision,” read an Instagram post from the eatery, “a German-influenced restaurant in the Union Hill neighborhood whose kitchen is helmed by co-owner Brittanny Anderson, a veteran of TV cooking shows including ‘Top Chef’ and ‘Chopped,’” relates The Washington Post.

“Many of our staff are women and/or members of the LGBTQ+ community. All of our staff are people with rights who deserve dignity and a safe work environment,” the Instagram post continued. “We respect our staff’s established rights as humans and strive to create a work environment where they can do their jobs with dignity, comfort and safety.”"
"If they can refuse service to a gay couple, why not the other way around? 🤷‍♂️"
"I’ll save you all a search, these assholes totally support the person in Colorado who is suing to keep LBGTQ from using her web design business. 

If not for double standards, conservatives have no standards at all."
"Quote from church group:
“Everyone should be concerned that people are being denied service based on their politics.”

Yet the group’s anti abortion and LGBTQ’s politics is driven by their religion. I wonder what the overtly religious Supreme Court would leak out on this case."
Give the hypocrites a taste of their own medicine.
Suddenly not making that wedding cake doesn't seem like such a good idea.
I see nothing wrong with this.
The right is insanely overrepresented.  It's time to show the right how it feels to be a minority in America
"This ain’t it. We can’t condemn one group for refusing service to some group we like, but then praise one group for refusing service to some group we hate. It should be both equal and equitable"
"I don't think they understand the issue. Gay people were welcome to come in and buy anything off the shelf at the bakery. The web site designer was willing to make any standard web site for a gay couple. Neither were willing to use their artistic expression to contribute to a gay marriage, which they believed was sin (stupid, but then that's religion for you). The web site designer would turn away a hetero person asking for a gay marriage site for a friend.

This restaurant denied standard service to a group just because of their religious beliefs. Should the court rule in favor of the web site maker, this restaurant will not be covered by that protection should this religious group sue because they are doing two different things."
"Am very curious how serving a steak is compelled speech. 

Saying a group doesn’t make you feel safe is a far different argument and underscores the fact the restaurant wanted to spike the football instead of abide by principles."
"I would rather we not compare this to the religious freedom BS happening with cakes and websites.  They are not comparable at all.

This isn't about religious or sex or gender discrimination. This is entirely about the wellbeing of the staff and the sustainability of the business.  These people are being disinvited for being an existential threat to the people working there."
"To be honest, as a Christian, this is fine with me in a way
They have the right to business and property
So why is it okay to refuse business to a gay couple, but not Christians?

Discrimination shouldn’t happen either way"
Love it. 👍
BRAVO!
"While I agree in principle, the reality is that the law allows for refusal of service based on one's personal moral values. This judicial interpretation was promulgated by Christian conservatives themselves. 

Therefore I do not see any reason why other aggrieved groups reciprocate in such a manner that would result in the original legal ruling be revisited."
"It's more of a piece of consciousness-raising theater.  Saying, ""how would you like it if people who found *you* offensive got to refuse *you* service, O Thou Nest of Karens?""."
"You missed it by miles. The Supreme court is going to rule that a person sincerely held religious beliefs are ground to be a bigot and exclude them from service.  Because the Radical right, the Christians want a nation based upon of separation, they are getting it.  The clowns deserved to be kicked out."
"And that restaurant has the right to refuse service to a pack of bigots as much as  that bakery did against people it deemed ""sinful"".     


You can't have it both ways, pick a lane and be consistent."
"In the same way that making a cake is, presumably."
"Ok that makes more sense. I didn’t know they had passed a law that propagated the refusal of service based on someone’s identity. Hopefully now that the shoe is on the other foot, they can review the law and hopefully get rid of it."
Masterpiece cake case happened only because the gay couple in question intentionally sought them out knowing the cake maker’s views.
">And that restaurant has the right to refuse service to a pack of bigots as much as that bakery did against people it deemed ""sinful"".

That pack of bigots didn't ask for any custom creation for a bigoted event that would invoke the 1st Amendment rights of the creator of the work. They just came in to eat and were refused service. That bakery did not refuse any LGBT person who came in to buy their general baked goods, only custom creations for same-sex weddings. 

>You can't have it both ways, pick a lane and be consistent.

It is both ways because it's two different subjects."
">And that restaurant has the right to refuse service to a pack of bigots as much as that bakery did against people it deemed ""sinful"".

>You can't have it both ways, pick a lane and be consistent.

It is both ways because it's two different subjects."
"Yeah, totally the same amount of expression between “medium rare” and a celebration of a historically significant recognized social-religious contract, nothing disingenuous at all about the equivalence."
"No laws were passed. A recent Supreme Court ruling allows private business owners to refuse service based on personal, sincerely held religious beliefs. This is the basis of all Freedom of Religion laws. In practice, it allows conservative Christians to refuse service to LGBT citizens or their kin, even in dire circumstances. 

This judicial position doesn't just cover a business as a while, but makes allowances for individual employees to refuse service even if the business allows LGBT people/women to seek a service in general. 

Conversely, this judicial position dubiously allows someone whose sincerely held beliefs include the toleration and equal treatment of all people (LGBT included) to be allowed to refuse service to those who wish to trample upon the rights and freedoms of others. 

Long story short, the chickens are coming home to roost. Christian conservatives have only themselves to blame for opening this can of worms."
"  
Yeah that's irrelevant.   


If a bakery can refuse service based on their christo-fascist beliefs have deemed the person to be inherently sinful because of who they are, then a restaurant can refuse service to a pack of hateful christo-fascists."
So you’re saying the state should be the arbiter of which forms of expression are meaningful?
"It’s entirely relevant because that is what the case is about. This restaurant is refusing to provide general goods and services based on the identity of a customer at the business, but that’s not what the case before the court is."
"No, the 1st amendment does that and that's where Colorado got in hot water with public accommodation laws."
">This restaurant is refusing to provide general goods and services based on the identity of a customer at the business,

And that is not really different than a bakery refusing to provide a service for a gay couple that they offer a straight couple.   
Your position would *maybe* have ground to stand on if 

* the restaurant was like a buffet place, with food already made and waiting there for the christo-fascists to acquire, or if the restaurant was a fast food place with pre-made food under a heat-lamp, AND
* Being gay was an opinion.

  
Your position is akin to ""Well it doesn't matter if the people walking in were Nazis, the Jewish restaurant has to serve them...."" when really no, they don't."
"The exact same argument could apply to existing laws against racial discrimination. People explicitly argued that they should be able to discriminate against interracial couples because of their religion! 

Your religious beliefs aren't an excuse to discriminate."
"You're still not getting it. 

The restaurant serves dishes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Anyone can come in, sit down, and order any of those dishes. Rejecting anyone on the basis of religion or sex is illegal discrimination. The web site or bakery never did this. This restaurant did. 

>And that is not really different than a bakery refusing to provide a service for a gay couple that they offer a straight couple.

If I wanted to gift a wedding web site to a gay friend who was getting married, this company would also refuse me, a straight person. 

It is the custom, expressive nature of these specific services that makes it legally complicated, not who is requesting the service. The restaurant was just serving their standard dishes, so their case has nothing to do with the case before the court now or the cake shop. 

But if you want the Westboro Baptists to be able to force a gay-run bakery to make a custom cake for their ""God Hates Fags"" rally, then fine. That will be the result if the web site company loses because that is exactly the legal issue before the court right now."
Your immutable sexual orientation isn’t an excuse to compel labor or expression.
">You're still not getting it. 

... yeah *I* am not getting it."
"Again, that same argument could be made against religion, race, sex, or any other protected class. 

The argument essentially boils down to “I think those other forms of discrimination are wrong, but I think this form of discrimination is right,” which is exactly the attitude that needs anti-discrimination laws."
Correct.
"I think it’s more unyielding force meets immovable object. 

There are clear lines of where liberties end and they’re usually found at the ends of another’s."
Oh sweetie....
"So should the business in this article be allowed to discriminate against Christians? What if every business in an area wants to discriminate? At what point is there a legitimate state interest in ensuring everyone has access to the market?

ETA: u/deltabagel, Reddit ate your reply, but at no point in it did you address either of my latter two questions. You don’t address the actual impact of the policies you promote, just the principles removed from any semblance of reality."
"This is one of the scariest things I have ever heard. 

■ Imagine always overthrowing an election because you do not like who got elected? 

■ Imagine deciding how someone votes, when they vote, if they can vote, and whether or not their vote will even be counted? 

■ Imagine deciding that you don't like the fact that a certain district has a history of leaning towards an all Democrat vote? And you've decided that it should be all Republican? Imagine gerrymandering to restructure district lines to your liking? So that your fantasy comes true? And there is nothing that anyone can do about it.

■ Imagine deciding that if you don't like the results of an election? You can just pretend the election never occurred and keep the incumbent in office? 

■ Imagine a No Holds Barred implementation of your fantasy so that, forever more? Only candidates that you like and support are put into office? With no way to protest, complain or stop the onslaught of your puppets? 

There are things like this being supported and put into place, right now, and even worse. 

That is why this case is in front of SCOTUS today.

>*At issue is a new legal theory that could conceivably give state legislatures virtually unchecked power over federal elections and erode major principles of democracy.*

State legislators could take all the power that they wanted? And not have any oversight. Be able to do whatever they wanted.

>*The ""independent state legislature theory,"" referred to as ISL, could give state legislatures independent power to put in place all manner of election rules, without any available review by state courts. In its most extreme form, the theory could eliminate not just state judicial power over elections, but governors' vetoes, and it might even allow state legislatures to certify presidential electors who were not approved by the voters, an idea that Donald Trump sought, unsuccessfully, to put forth in 2020.*

In a nutshell?

>*The case before the court is a perhaps more modest exercise of the conservative ISL theory. The North Carolina state legislature, dominated by Republicans, is seeking to overturn a decision by the state Supreme Court. That court ruled that the Republican legislature, in drawing new congressional district lines after the 2020 Census, had violated the state constitution with an extreme partisan gerrymander. The court twice ordered the legislature to redraw the map, and when those efforts came up short, the state court, with the aid of court-appointed election experts, redrew new lines itself.*

It's scary to think what the Republicans are trying to do. 

It seems like it is their intention to win at all costs. 

Even if they do something illegal. 

Even if they do something immoral come. 

As long as they win? They don't seem to care.

>*We know that at the end of the day, if this court rules in favor of the Republicans, that state legislatures across the country will have exclusive control over running federal elections in their states, which stands our system of checks and balances on its head,"" he said.*

Listen to SCOTUS (below). It is fascinating and a little over 3 hours.

Of course, the werewolves are not so easily... so easy, ya know? But if a cheerleader could have done that, imagine what a football great like Walker is doing for us? Because a cheerleader has to be driven to a clinic if she gets in a way. and Walker knows this. He is the hero we all should need."

Far surpassing anything any one of us could ever have imagined.

A federal judge __had to force__ an Arizona County to certify their election results.

Did they think that by not certifying the results that they __could keep the results secret,__ and not allow the election winners to take office?

Sort of like what the January 6 __insurrectionists attempted?__

The __freight train__ of one term twice impeached former President Trump’s treachery and logorrhea still *lingers,* even after his failed __insurrection and miserably conniving__ attempts at *maintaining a stronghold* on the RNC, GOP and the USA.

>*Election results have largely been certified without issue around the country, but Arizona was an exception. Several Republican - controlled counties delayed their certification despite no evidence of problems with the vote count. Cochise County in southeastern Arizona blew past the deadline last week, forcing a judge to intervene on Friday and order the county supervisors to certify the election by the end of the day.*

Officials stated __every vote__ was counted.

>*County officials say everyone was able to vote and all legal ballots were counted.*

And?

The people have voted.

>*Arizona's top races went resoundingly for Democrats after Republicans nominated a slate of candidates backed by Trump who focused on supporting his claims about the 2020 election. In addition to Hobbs and Mayes, Democrat Sen. Mark Kelly was reelected and Democrat Adrian Fontes won the race for secretary of state.*

There is a *profound link* between autocracy and corruption. One of the things that autocrats do?  They __push back against anybody or anything__ who could ensure accountability.

Whether that is the media, right to vote laws, courts, official ballots, prosecutors, inspector generals, etc. Whichever __existing institution__ they feel is in their way.

They __push back,__ mock them, make fun of them, take away their influence (power), and subjugate any appearance of democracy. 

Because they want to get away with __breaking the law themselves.__

They are simultaneously undermining democracy and the rule of law.

It's not an accident that those two things go together.  

Pushing back against those practices, forcing even our highest leaders (including presidents, congress members and cabinet leaders) to __meet the consequences__ of their actions (just like other members of society) is what it __means to be a democracy.__

"From everything I've read, they wanted to be able to avoid certifying elections in the future. 
 This was a long term ploy.

They tried it here, where they'd have taken a short term loss, thinking that the Democrats can't think long term, to allow them to take a major win through unabashed election fraud in the future.  They probably assumed that the Democrats would jump at the chance to gain a seat, not realizing the broader implications.

Even if the Dems had let them get away with it to gain an additional house rep, the Republicans would still control the house regardless.  It was a safe play to test what precedent would look like in the future."

"As far as I'm aware, in New Zealand a business can't file for bankruptcy, only individuals can file for bankruptcy.

A business can be forced to liquidate if it can't repay its creditors, but only an individual can declare bankruptcy to discharge certain debts.

[It's true that during the bankruptcy process](https://www.moneyhub.co.nz/bankruptcy.html) you're typically not allowed to be in a managerial position in any business, be self-employed, or join a family-owned business venture  (or at least you need to seek special permission from the relevant agency).

As for limiting the number of businesses a person can own, I'm not sure what the point of that its?

If someone's good at starting businesses and they're all healthy and profitable then why would you want to limit them from owning more? So long as there's no anti-trust issues then what's the purpose of this?"
"That doesn't sound like a good idea to be at all. It sounds like it would stifle people from trying to start a business because it feels like you get one attempt and if you fail you can never try again. This just seems like it would further empower existing large businesses and disincentivize people from starting their own small businesses.

Small businesses go under a whole lot more often than large ones."
"That's kind of sad. What if they go through a divorce or have a major health issue or injury? I can see putting some kind of limit on it to keep it from being abused, but not only once."
Covid drove a lot of places bankrupt. This would punish small businesses more than monopolies.
"You want to incentivize people to build businesses and hire people. You don’t want to incentivize people to earn over some magical cliff where they can avoid taxes and social responsibility. This isn’t hard. 

1. Support unions but don’t make them mandatory
2. Encourage fair and simple taxes
3. Drive population activity though incentives like tax breaks and cash and time awards 
4. Encourage personal freedom and social responsibility without being particularly overweight in either. 
5. Provide safety nets for health, education and workforce development."
"There is a terrible idea and I’m not sure you understand how either businesses or bankruptcy works. 

Supporting a strong social safety net and reasonable regulations are much better ways to build a fair economy."
"""I don’t believe that one family owning 141 McDonald’s franchises is what our founding fathers had in mind.""

Sure, the Founding Fathers, who owned giant plantations worked by slaves, surely would have a problem with a family owning too many restaurants. 

What problem exactly are you trying to solve here and why do you think that imagining the feelings of the Founding Fathers is relevant?"
Just plain awful idea.
This is an incredibly stupid idea.
"Not sure that would be a good idea. A higher percentage of entrepreneurs have declared bankruptcy than the average population. Hard to quantify, but it seems the cost society has borne to cover these bankruptcies has led to future successes. 

If someone is entrepreneurial, I think it would be good to encourage that mentality in the hope it would lead to greater societal utility."
"From an economics and motivational theory prospective this could be bad.  


The reason business owners get so much of the money compared to their employees is because they take on the initial risk. Risk is really valuable in a thriving economy. Those that are very successful are risk takers and are comfortable with failure historically. However, according to theories on human motivation such as a anything incorporating a cost/benefits analysis. Humans will consider the benefits of their action against the cost.   


The vast majority of millionaires and billionaires in the USA are self made and the way they do it is that at the start they weigh the benefit of starting a business (being rich) with the failure (having to start over), and they are okay to put 10 thousand hours into something and then start over. If we add the idea that if they file bankruptcy they cannot start over, it drastically changes the cost and will discourage many from starting one to begin with, ultimately harming the economy as we see less successes."
"America would say ""That's just Un-American"""
"You think that someone who owns 141 McDonald's locations is going to raise the price of a happy meal since they cornered the market?  If not, what's your fear?  Or do you just feel that there should be a limit to success?"

1 in 10 businesses fail. So you don’t want any businesses? Good luck making everything yourself.
I think NZ has the right idea
">As for limiting the number of businesses a person can own, I'm not sure what the point of that its?

I start two businesses.  You hire one of my businesses to perform some work for you. The way I conduct business causes serious harm to you.  You can only sue that particular business, rather than me.  You can only go after the assets I've put in that business's name, rather than all the business assets I have. If that particular business doesn't have the assets necessary to make you whole, to bad, so sad. I just cut off that particular branch and focus on my other businesses. 

Being limited to one business doesn't stop me from exploring multiple business ventures.  It just means that they are treated as different divisions of the same parent company. When one of my divisions causes you harm, you can seek restitution from the parent company and all of its divisions. 

You should not be able to attack my home or personal property, but you should not be limited to just one of my business ventures to make yourself whole. You should be able to recoup damages from any and all of my business activities."
"Especially restaurants. Lots of restaurants fail on the first, second, third tries. And then you can never open another restaurant again?"
"It’s to try to stop ‘phoenix’ companies I.e companies that rise from the ashes… as a real world example, a construction company declares bankruptcy to not pay taxes or suppliers or wages but turns up the next day to continue work and demanding payment to a new entity."
"Large businesses CREATE businesses for the specific purpose of exporting their expenses to those businesses, having those businesses declare bankruptcy, and then having no responsibility to pay those debts.

Making it so businesses can't do that doesn't sound like a good idea. It sounds like an EXCELLENT idea."
Yeah I see there are downsides. Maybe not so strict but definitely need to reign in current policy
"YourFriend LLC isn't limited to selling beef. It can sell beef **and** operate a summer camp **and** host weddings.  Those three things are not related, but that doesn't mean they need to be organized as separate businesses.  YourFriend LLC can also partner with TriscuitBob LLC to produce widgets, or invest in an entire business portfolio. 

Limiting you to one LLC doesn't prevent you from engaging in multiple business practices. It just means you have to organize them as multiple divisions under the same parent company. YourFriend LLC can register any number of DBA (""Doing Business As"") names. 

Insulating personal assets from business operations is reasonable.  If your business fails, your business creditors should only be able to attach business assets, not your home, car, retirement fund, etc. 

But, when you direct one of your businesses to stop paying its bills, your creditors should be able to attach *any* of your businesses.  When one of your businesses fails, your other, successful businesses should make your creditors whole."
What’s un American about leveling the playing field? Isn’t America a place of new ideas and innovation? Why can’t we create a new economic system?
"I think it would allow more people opportunities to own their own McDonald’s or whatever restaurant/business 
Yes it is completely opposite of current popular culture.
Instead of 1 family cornering the market and passing it down for generations we potentially have 141 families who can survive. Like it used to be! Local businesses owned by locals."
"Limited liability is a pretty important concept that encourages people to start businesses. Without it you're making people risk their whole lives and livelihoods whenever they start a business. You'd mainly be punishing small business owners if you removed the ability to have a limited liability company.

Also, if you start a hairdressing business and a restaurant and I sue you for giving me a bad haircut, how does it make sense that I can take assets from the restaurant? I'm not sure how that works given that a company is a separate legal entity from the owner. The owner/s and the company are not the same thing in legal terms."
"Why do they fail in the first place? Out marketed by huge conglomerates? Possibly? 
Also if more people owned small businesses they would be more inclined to shop at locally owned businesses. 
I’m not an economist, just sick of the status quo."
Then maybe they should make laws restricting exploiting bankruptcies for personal gain instead of making something so broad that it seems it would have many unintended consequences.
"Right, so make a law against that, not a broad punishment against anyone declaring bankruptcy for any reason."
"They're not saying any of those things is unamerican; they're saying your suggestion of how to go about it is unamerican. For instance, disallowing someone from starting a new business when they're first attempt failed."

"That’s just one example. In Australia you cannot be director of a business for 5 years after bankruptcy.  It’s all moot, just start it under your partners name."
"Apparently you're unaware that large businesses also have these employees called ""lawyers"" who they pay to get around special carve-out laws like you're advocating so that they can continue their unethical practices that are ostensibly banned.

Carve-out laws don't work. Instead create a blanket law and use a carve-out in the opposite way to provide exceptions for individuals starting their first business."
"Then I disagree with OP. 

I do think that the owner of 141 franchises should pay a hell of a lot higher tax rate than the 141 owners of 1 franchise each. Maybe 3 to 5 times as much, specifically to discourage the problems OP is worried about.  

I think that our tax structure should be pushing the owners of successful business toward divestiture. If you can successfully generate sufficient income to support an extraordinarily lavish lifestyle, you should be pushed - hard - to transfer excessive shares to other people, entitling them to a share of your business's profits. You can choose to offer them to employees, or sell them to investors (who would also have their own ""lavish lifestyle"" limits). Or you can reduce your excessive income by increasing your payroll expenses: paying your workers a greater percentage of the money they earn you. 

If you are obscenely wealthy and don't want to divest ownership or increase your payroll, you'll pay an obscene amount of taxes.   You can ""lift up"" yourself and the people who helped you get to the top, or you will be ""dragged down"", and let the government decide how your money will be spent."
"Your concern about ""all debts"" owed to other businesses is misplaced. These are businesses that chose to extend credit. The creditors are responsible for evaluating their risk before extending credit and performing their own due diligence. Why do you want increased government involvment when a business makes a bad risk assessment?"
And what about the small businesses who are trying to legitimately use bankruptcy? They can never open another business again just to make sure we punish people trying to exploit it?
Exactly this.
Currently it’s pretty impossible to start a business. Giving more opportunities to the masses might have a downside but is it better than what we currently are facing?
"Your argument is like saying people shouldn't take chemotherapy to combat cancer because it also kills non-cancerous cells.

No, you create the laws to go after the biggest problems, and you create carve-outs to address specific small instances when certain small groups need to be protected.

Wealthy people fucking people over is a drastically bigger and drastically more pressing issue than the hypothetical of an individual small business having a problem.

We are EXPERIENCING wealthy people fucking people over. It is ACTUALLY HAPPENING right now on a large scale. The thing you're talking about, not so much."
"No, my argument is that you shouldn't make punishments so broad that they punish the innocent as well just to make sure the guilty are punished. People aren't cells. They're people. If you've narrowed down a list of suspects, you don't send them all to prison to make sure the perpetrator doesn't get away.

>We are EXPERIENCING wealthy people fucking people over.

So we should change it so the government fucks people over instead?

>The thing you're talking about, not so much.

The thing I'm talking about? Declaring bankruptcy? You really think there are more illegitimate bankruptcies done to exploit the system than legitimate ones where a business just failed?"
"The whole ""punishment"" claim is BS.

The system is actively being exploited by the wealthy. You're using the possibility that acting to prevent that might cause some small problems as justification for not doing anything to prevent the wealthy from exploiting the system."
"You don't think never being allowed to own a business again isn't a punishment?

My friend owned a restaurant that was quite successful for years. Business slowed considerably in 2020 due to COVID to the point that he had to shut down. You don't think it would be a punishment to tell him he can never try to open another restaurant ever again just so we make sure we prevent the wealthy from exploiting the system?"
"I agree and shouldn’t bankruptcy be a punishment? 

Closing a business that isn’t profitable is fine. Taking on debt that you can’t repay hurts all of us. Maybe making it harder, less enticing is exactly what we need to correct the course for future generations"
"We have an ACTIVE ONGOING CANCER of wealthy people.

You're arguing a hypothetical of something that affects very small numbers of people against a KNOWN ACTIVE THING that's currently affecting literally every person in the country.

Your priorities are COMPLETELY out of order.

If keeping honest small businesses active and working, government should provide active aid to small businesses, not perpetuate systems in which large businesses can create fake small businesses to hide shady business deals."
">You're arguing a hypothetical of something that affects very small numbers of people against a KNOWN ACTIVE THING that's currently affecting literally every person in the country.  
>  
>Your priorities are COMPLETELY out of order.

Really? Bankruptcy only affects a small number of people versus the number of large businesses exploiting bankruptcy? Can you find examples of this actually happening? Legitimate bankruptcies happen all the time. How often does what you're talking about actually happen?

I think your priorities are completely out of order, not mine."
"You're refusing to acknowledge the disproportionate control the wealthy have within the system.

They specifically set things up so lackeys like you will argue to defend their system.

And you're fulfilling the role they've put you in."
"I'm not defending them. I'm trying to make sure that we don't make laws in attempt to punish the wealthy people who are exploiting the system and wind up punishing everyone else too. And no, I don't think ""But wealthy people have really good lawyers"" is a good excuse to make broad laws that just punish everyone across the board."
"You're insisting that it's not possible to create laws that prevent the exploitation being caused by the wealthy people, and instead of advocating for laws that actually would help real small businesses to avoid going bankrupt, you're presenting a really weak argument that that would be the inevitable outcome if we dared to try to hold the wealthy accountable."
I'm insisting that it is possible to make targeted laws that stop people from exploiting bankruptcy in the way you're talking about while not harming everyone else as collateral damage.
"You're insisting that ineffective laws will be effective, and ignoring literally hundreds of years in which the kinds of laws you're advocating have been attempted and have failed to bring about the positive benefits you're incorrectly stating that ""They will THIS time. HONEST."""
"Republicans know the conservative mind is highly motivated by fear and anxiety, so there is a constant marketing campaign on the right to invent new labels to put on their liberal competition such as ""woke"". What I find interesting is the right having to define ""woke"" during the recent lawsuit against DeSantis...

""Asked what “woke” means more generally, \[Desantis’ General Counsel Ryan\] Newman said “it would be the belief there are systemic injustices in American society and the need to address them.”

  
Which is weird because sounds exactly like Trump's MAGA argument. The way Republicans can twist their logic into pretzels and still sell it to the masses never ceases to amaze me."

"The question is whether Biden has the authority under the legislation his administration cited to forgive the debt unilaterally.  Not the loan forgiveness itself.   You don't need to agree with forgiveness to find support for the authority to issue it.

It's going to be interesting.  

It's one of the things where I wouldn't necessarily spend too much time worrying about what people who aren't legal scholars are saying.  A lot of the comments I see about this really don't get into a deeper analysis than ""conservative justices do this, liberal justices do that,"" not understanding judicial philosophy vs political philosophy."

"I could be mistaken. But isnt it going to be shot down because that's a congress power, not a president power?"
"I honestly don’t know how an actual judge could rule against this. It’s pretty explicitly stated in the heroes act that the president has been granted this power by congress.

>“Notwithstanding any other provision of law, unless enacted with specific reference to this section, the Secretary of Education may waive or modify any statutory or regulatory provision applicable to the student financial assistance programs . . . as the Secretary deems necessary in connection with a war or other military operation or national emergency.”

> Section 1098bb(a)(2) further provides that any waiver or modification must not act to worsen a student’s financial position under the loan. Thus, during the period of suspension, no interest will accrue on outstanding loans so that borrowers are in the same position as they were before the suspension period began.

>Section 1098bb(b)(3) provides for blanket waivers or modifications to the statute or regulations — that is, such waivers or modifications do not need to be reviewed and granted case by case.

The suspension of payments we are currently enjoying is based on this law as well."
This is a presidential powers question. It needs to come from Congress (“power of the purse”) not the president (no purse power ranger).

"I think technically it’s the 49th year, and the 50th year is Jubilee."
Christianity’s impact on finance has an interesting history
"He is much more moderate than people give him credit for. Hes sided with the liberal wing on native american rights among some others. I'm not saying he's a Saint or good or anything, but I agree with your assessment. 

I do think student loan forgiveness will survive the Supreme Court though. 7-2 is my best guess with Kavanugh, Gorush and Roberts voting with the 4 left justices. I would also not be surprised if ACB joins and makes it 8-1."
"This is what most people tend to overlook with the supreme court, regardless of how much left and right justices try to stretch the constitution in their own direction. I don't personally think the Biden admin will be able to pull it off, even with the citation of the Heroes Act of 2003."

"Agree probably Roberts, if only to preserve some semblance of credibility for the court.

Can’t imagine where you get the idea Alito would support. He’s probably the most hostile to almost anything a liberal might like next to Thomas. 

I would think of the conservative justices, Gorsuch is the least likely to oppose, but not by much."
"I hear you. I am two years away from my PSLF total discharge, so the 10k was not personally helpful to me, but I really do hope it is allowed to go through for others."
How is this clown being taken seriously at all???
"Oh, y’think?"
"Wow, I’m so glad we got to hear from this important and knowledgeable figure so that we— the uninformed public—could receive the crucial information that this blathering buffoon’s latest mouth fart was in fact a smelly one."
The criminal is asking for obvious reasons:   Constitution or Criminal Dictatorship - we decide!
"It's wrong, crazy, and 100% in character. Seriously, nothing he does can shock me at this point. He isn't even good at being a compelling villain."
"Me and you say that kinda stuff - we get put on a watch list or raided by the FBI.

Trump does it - he gets to run for the Oval Office again in 2024."
"Trump has never had the politician's filter. Presidents shit on the Constitution all the time, but they're careful to try to justify it and deny that they're actually shitting on it. Then Trump comes and says the quiet part out loud -- screw the Constitution if it's getting in my way. 

It's like the red flag laws. Lots of Democrats support it but try to couch it in nice-sounding terms, like there's nothing wrong with them. Then Trump comes out and accurately describes red flag laws in stark terms as ""take the guns first, due process later."" Then everybody finally freaks out about the concept, many of them without knowing they're actually freaking out about red flag laws."
/r/duh
Have you ever met one of the members of his base?
*Calling Donald J Trump a clown is a insult to all the clowns in the whole wide world.*
Would you rather this person stay quiet? It is obvious but if I were a public/political figure on either side I would be hopping on every social media platform loudly condemning the remarks. Silence is tacit approval in situations like this.
"In proper red flag law process, you get to challenge it before the guns are taken. As in due process first, take guns later. Ex parte gun confiscation sans arrest is (in my layman view) unconstitutional and plain (morally) wrong."
"Not really, you?"
*Donald J Trump craves the spotlight.*
"The usual red flag law allows someone to give a sob story, possibly made up, to a judge, often even over the phone, and the confiscation order is issued without the target ever knowing something was wrong. And since they've labeled it a civil procedure, the target is not guaranteed an attorney when he later fights against the state to have his rights restored."
Several are my family members.
"Ya, that's troubling..."
"I'm in the same boat. They explain away every crazy, cruel, inhuman thing he says and does."
Has Trump’s crazy come so far full circle that he is now single handedly dismantling the GOP and actually inversely helping the Dems??
Doesn't the President have to vow to uphold the constitution as part of the inauguration?
Maybe they can use this statement as further evidence of sedition at his trial.
The constitution has been around longer than six weeks so unfortunately you cannot abort it.
Treason by Trump - Again!!!!!!!!
"The __demagogic temerity__ of pugnacious, narcissistic, and want-to-be fascist dictator / defeated grifter and one term former President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice)__ and the imbroglio he has foisted upon our country *knows no bounds.* Guilty __(at the very least) of extreme direlection of duty, his cognitive dissonance __moves forward unchecked.__

The White House and Democrats have come forward, condemning one term former President Trump's (the only president to be impeached twice) disgusting statements.

>*""White House spokesman Andrew Bates said Mr Trump's comments were ""anathema to the soul of our nation"". ""You cannot only love America when you win,"" Mr Bates said in a statement.* 

Saying that our US Constitution should be destroyed is like saying you hate the USA and you are an insurrectionist. And clearly?  President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice)__ truly supports his own narrative that he has been promoting for years.

>*The White House has condemned former President Donald Trump after he called for the ""termination"" of the US constitution.*

Where are the droves of Republicans coming out of the shadows to condemn one term former President Trump's (the only president to be impeached twice) words? Can you imagine if a Democratic candidate for US president spewed forth with this grotesque ideology?

>*In the post, Mr Trump referred to vague allegations of ""massive & widespread fraud and deception"" and asked whether he should be immediately returned to power. ""A Massive Fraud of this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution. Our great 'Founders' did not want, and would not condone, False & Fraudulent Elections!"" he said.*

IMO?

Former President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice)__ is actually laying the groundwork for another insurrection. He is quite succint and has left no doubt in regards to what his intentions are.

Maybe the fawning sychophants of the radical Trumpanzee Republicon right could conjure up a way to debase themselves some more?

And if that's not bad enough? Former President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice)__ claims he had no knowledge of certain people who dined with him. Anyone who knows anything about the Secret Service and the president would know that no one comes near former President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice)__ unless they are veted. For instance? You or I could not just walk up to Mar-a-Lago or anywhere else. and sit down at the same table for a meal. Ye is known for his radical beliefs and hate filled rhetoric and ideology. And he also invited a well know denier.

It's no coincidence that he sat down for a meal with these people right after announcing his intent to enter the election for the office of the US presidency.

>*But he has come under fire this week after dining with a known white nationalist and Holocaust denier at his Florida home. Mr Trump said he was not aware that the man would be present and said he had accompanied the rapper Kanye West - who earlier this week expressed admiration for Adolf Hitler and has been accused of a host of antisemitic comments.*

The Republican Party *currently supports* autocracy, bribes, bullying, cheating, control of a woman's body, dismantling the US Constitution, fascism, fear, fraud, hatred, insurrectionists, racism, stealing top secret government documents, white supremacy, __pursuit of alternative facts (lies)__ and grifting.

When someone tells you who they are the first time? You need to believe them. And that's what America needs to do if they plan on ridding our political offices of these types of influences.

Edit - Added last paragraph."
*Donald J Trump is trying to destroy American democracy and he must not win the next election because if he does he will not make America great again and it would be a permanent end to American democracy and the damage will be done and it wont be able to be repaired and there will be no turning back. Watch out and very scary.*
Obviously not condemned by republicans… how on brand of them
"u/apefist

You mentioned:

>>*Right but they can flip in an instant. It makes me nervous*

__Everyone is nervous__ about SCOTUS.

President Biden signed a bill in May 2022 to ensure Americans can check the financial disclosures of Federal judges and Supreme Court justices. 

Judges have been remiss in filing their financial disclosures. Now? The financial disclosures will be in an online format so that everyone will be able to check. It would be good to know if a judge was hearing a case that involved a company that he or his family members owned stock. I think that's a very significant change for American jurisprudence.

>*The new law, the Courthouse Ethics and Transparency Act, mandates the creation of an online database where the public can search federal judges’ and Supreme Court justices’ financial disclosures. It also mandates that judges and justices follow the same financial disclosure rules as Congress, which require that transaction reports are filed for any securities trades worth more than $1,000 within 45 days of the deal. The law says the database must be online within 180 days of enactment and that all future disclosures must be uploaded within 90 days of the May 15 filing deadline.*

I hope Congress is able to force Code of Ethics / Standards on SCOTUS.

>*Supreme Court justices are the only judicial officers in the country not governed by an ethics code, and Democrats have introduced bills in both the House and the Senate that would not only impose a formal code of conduct, but also raise standards for when judges and justices must recuse themselves because of a perceived conflict of interest.*

For the first time in years? Ethics standards could be implemented. SCOTUS might have to recuse themselves if there is a conflict of interest. 

I so hope that this is something that will be taken seriously and implemented as soon as possible.

>*After calls for broader reforms of the Supreme Court dominated the Democratic presidential primary, President Joe Biden issued an executive order in April 2021 establishing a commission of legal experts to provide analysis of the “principal arguments” for and against -“including an appraisal of the merits and legality” - of various proposed reforms, such as changing the size and composition of the court or imposing term limits on justices. Some progressive advocates felt the reform commission would give an opinion on such proposals. But in the end, the commissioners did not take a position on either controversial issue. Democrats have introduced bills in the House and the Senate that would impose term limits on justices, but they have not advanced.*

Let's encourage our legislatures to push this initiative forward. Write them and let them know you're interested in a code of ethics for SCOTUS.

Remember? You can write the White House / President Biden. Notify your state's Governor and Congress (which consists of the House of Representatives and the Senate) that you ___ARE___ watching them and paying attention to what they are doing and saying.

But not by Republicans. What a shock..
The GOP will still wet the bed like the spineless cowards they are when it comes to defending the clown king
"Not that we haven't passed that line a long time ago, but that's an immediate disqualification."
I feel bad for whoever has to type out his crazy rants as his mind continues to dissolve and degrade.
We all knew he was a treasonist. This just confirms it even more. He wants to become an absolute dictator.
I see this as him just finally saying it out loud. It's not like we didn't already know. This is the start of the public meltdown that George Conway told us to watch for.
Did the futurama writers write this timeline?
"To their credit, I saw folks on the conservative sub blasting trump for this. Which is very encouraging"
And crickets from republicans ?
That clown has snapped. Hopefully he stays off Twitter like he's been doing.
Trump just doesn’t want to wear an ankle bracelet for 5 years.
Now they should push a bill thru invoking the 14th amendment and disqualifying him from federal office
"In case anyone was wondering, and didn’t want to go in Truth Social to read it, he said this in the middle of a spiel about “fraudulent elections”:  

>”A Massive Fraud of this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those those found in the Constitution.”"
If this statement does not meet the test for treason and banning from office what does?
He’s desperate to be relevant
"How many liberals, leftists, progressives, or others basically agree - but for themselves? We hear constantly about how representation in government is biased toward Republicans, and how the Constitution doesn't work, or include certain rights. There's no Constitutional Right to an education, for instance.

This isn't an unpopular opinion. Not as much as you'd think. It's just that the only people who want it gone only want their own in place, and that's okay."
Nice to see the left defending the constitution for a change. Does this mean they won't be crusading against the second amendment any more.
But what did he say though. The article had a quote but it didn't sound like he was calling to end constitution. Just sounded like her was birthing
"""Whatever enriches him personally.""

That has been his sole objective the entire time."
It is to be devoutly hoped.
*Donald J Trump is a psychopath.*
"Ummm? He's been doing that for years. 

His intention has been to destroy America and the US Constitution.

His words and actions have never left any doubt."
Russian end game?
"Yes, of course.

But then January 6 occurred."
The vow isn’t binding. Reference: Jan 6.
"It made it through 9 months, so they no longer care about it."
"Look at the Supreme Court case dealing with the independent state legislature theory. If they rule for that case, elections will become a thing of the past."
"I can see a bunch of Tea Baggers saying ""ya know, I think he's onto something. Let's shake things up!"""
"It is disqualification only if a Democrat candidate says it.
Republicans being silent are complicit"
Not much from them.
The Amendment exists already. He needs to be charged for it to be effective.
This exact quote is in the article. And the article also states that it is from Truth Social.
"He needs to be charged.

But I agree. Why vote for anyone who will not pledge to uphold and protect the US Constitution?"
"Here is the quote from the article. Read it a few times.

One term former President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice)__  uses Truth Social like he used to use Twitter.

It truly says that he wants to terminate the rules, regulations and articles...

>*In the post, Mr Trump referred to vague allegations of ""massive & widespread fraud and deception"" and asked whether he should be immediately returned to power. ""A Massive Fraud of this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution. Our great 'Founders' did not want, and would not condone, False & Fraudulent Elections!"" he said.*

I hate that anyone has to spend a single breath talking about former President Trump. There are so many things that are hurting our communities, and there are so many beautifully esquisite things to celebrate. 

His negativity sucks up all of the oxygen wherever he goes."
He is also a pig fucker.
"His intention is self-aggrandisement like any malignant narcissist.
The country, its history and people are all just collateral damage..."
Nah that’s just the unfortunate side effect. He is just doing whatever he thinks will get him out of trouble with the law
Older than Ivanka so no interest therr
"Yes. Everyone is following this case. 

Yet SCOTUS has not helped one term former President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice)__ and his sycophants recently."
"It sounds to me like he's saying that's what his idea of massive voter fraud will lead to. As in, he should return to office or the constitution is meaningless. It's classic stupid Trump but it's nothing special to me."
"Every time he faps, yeah"
'Why would you call me a pigfucker?'
"Of course he thinks that.

But If that were his only truth?

He would not be posting on Truth Social that he wanted to destroy the US Constitution. 

Specifically. 

In words that cannot be denied, forgiven, or mistaken.

No way.

>*In the post, Mr Trump referred to vague allegations of ""massive & widespread fraud and deception"" and asked whether he should be immediately returned to power. ""A Massive Fraud of this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution.

Right but they can flip in an instant. It makes me nervous
He posts that because he is desperate to get back to the safety given by the presidency. This whole election lie was made to desperately cling to power and avoid prosecution. He has no goal beyond making as much money as possible and will say or do whatever it takes to achieve that
<insert picture of Hershel Walker>
I believe that the 'men' who do this have a problem with their own identities.
"Please tell me it’s their piece of shit governor. Sigh it’s not, just a regular fine citizen of Texas."
As he should have - a crime is a crime.  The criminal who threatening the doctor by an ignorant criminal should face the law!
And he will walk free in Texarse.
Donate an equal amount to an LGBT advocacy group?
"I'd imagine she already got a huge chunk of loot in the licensing agreement.  Buying or not buying will have zero effect on her making or not making $.  I'll wager it's guaranteed $$ as well.

Also note, she's not involved in any aspects of the game development.  Just a licensing $$ grab."
Buy it used? You'll just have to wait a bit longer.
"When asked how she sleeps at night knowing her transphobia has alienated her audience she replied: “I read my recent royalty cheques and find the pain goes away pretty quickly.” 

It’s true that the amount of money she’ll get in royalties from an individual purchase is probably minuscule compared to the total she’ll make from this game and even more minuscule compared to how much she’s made already off the brand.But it wont be zero and for me that’s far more comfort than I’m willing to contribute to that odious rat."
Don’t give her any more money. The employees will move on
"I'm not a Christian, but I celebrate Christmas with my family. It brings us together, gives us an excuse to decorate and make things pretty- it gives us something to look forward to and we get to enjoy the delight in our kids as they celebrate with us. 

But the history of the holiday, the people who attempt to take control of it and claim ownership over it's symbolism, and often make plenty of money from it all year... it could be argued that we're supporting a group of people we normally go out of our way to avoid...

So you have to take ownership over it yourself. You have to understand that you cannot control other people's actions and beliefs, and you have to take from it what you like and enjoy and leave the rest to others.

In the western world, we have to delude ourselves to sleep at night. Just purchasing standard household items can support child labor. Or sweatshops. We can try to only purchase from places we are assured are clean of exploitation, but if you own a cell phone...

It can be a dire place to live. It can wear on the insides of the mind. I would like to say that we can all make a difference and make things better, but that, in reality, rarely really happens. 

Don't trouble yourself too much. Be happy with the memories and the magic and make it your own. Not buying the game will not prevent her from doing or saying more. That train to Hogwarts left the station, so to say. In the mean time, be true to yourself. Make right where you can. Teach your children to be better and the real of the world. But don't strip enjoyment of small things for principals if you cannot afford them. And they may not really matter as much as what you do with your life and family as well. 

I guess I'm trying to say effect change for good where you can, but be kind to yourself as well."
"It's not just the immediate profit from the game. It's the fact that if the game is a success, she will not be discouraged from doing more."
"This, most of her money has been made is already paid for the licensing rights to her and Warner Bros. And Scholastic. She splits it with them. Not like it matters, she’s a billionaire. The theme parks sure as hell shows zero signs of slow down."
"We need to remember there are extreme left, left, middle left, middle, middle right, right, and extreme right. An excessively loud but extremely small minority full the extreme left and extreme right regardless of what biased media outlets say. I’d ballpark the major the money comes from Left, middle left, middle, middle right, and right. Those are the ones who may not 100% agree with politics but still go about their lives. 

Basically the game will sell very very well even if they only hit that market without the extremes as that’s going to be about 90% of the business. Anything Harry Potter sells. People approach her company and her company signs off on it with her approval. She simply collects checks now."
"Good. The more they do the more advertisers will leave. The Muskrat can’t prop up the entire thing forever with his own funds.

"Wouldn’t know left Twitter last month, Elons toy is just that a toy to him, kinda like Trumps toy Truth Social."
What funny is he is ONLY bringing back alt right Nazis. My account that got banned for making a parody Elon Musk page is still inactive and permanently suspended
*I am happy not to use Twitter.*
muskrat and his dumb ass twitter can't fail soon enough.
I left Twitter last week.
Did Musk spend $44 billion to turn Twitter into 4chan?
"Funny isn't it, Liberals non MAGA, Non NeoNaziis are banned for life for hurting their feelings by telling them the truth!  Meanwhile they can threaten to kill you or family or friends, use terroristic threats against you and your loved ones and that's FREE SPEECH!  This is now worldwide!"
It was public. This was a hostile takeover ultimately right?
Putin getting everything he's ordered.
"Apparently calling a Q recruiter a bimbo is not a forgivable offense, since I am still banned."
"He’s become addicted to attention. Trump is but he was even before his presidency. Ignore him, join Twitter is you or not. Just ignore Musk"
Why are we blaming Elon and not the people behind the QAnon and far right accounts?
"I see no problem with it personally. I welcome all opinions.  
I would rather they bury themselves than people listen to their friends or the news.

Unless they break current TOS or laws - no harm done."
"He has investors. If you look at who they are, it'll tell you a lot about why they're not throwing a fit over losing their money. 

I do hope he continues to turn Twitter into a rightwing hellscape. It'll be the best and most obvious illustration yet of how the ultra-rich are destroying society, so we need to reign them in somehow - higher taxes on them, laws regulating social media, better laws regulating news outlets, laws that protect people against death threats and other online abuse..."
"Same here, and mine wasn't an elon-parody page - just a liberal Twitterer who told a Maga maggot he has a small penis some months ago. Boom, got suspended permanently and still am."
"Yup. Mine was banned before Musk, and is still banned."
"Well Musk obviously only wants people he agrees with on his platform...the ""free speech"" thing is just a façade."
"I’m suspended for saying McCarthy is a vote whore, which he is"
Breaks pre elon twitter TOS regardless.
I went on Twitter for a total of 2 weeks then NOped the hell out.
"That faction are enabling the problem. It’s as if they joined Truth Social or Parler to try to change it. They don’t want to admit… Twitter is gone. It is Parler 2.0 and they are participating in it.  Until they leave, it will continue to maintain legitimacy. Their presence will not undo what Musk is doing. It’s a private company now. Their presence keeps advertisers there."
He didn't spend $44b.  He used stock swaps and financing with other people's money.
Yes.
"It would seem that was his goal, regardless of how he bought Twitter."
Because they had been sanitized from Twitter and he recontaminated  it.
"I think it’s odd that no one is mad at dorcy for selling. He knew who he was selling to, he knew what would happen, and he still sold."
Sooo burning money is the new free speech methodology?
BuT ITs oNlY COnsERvAtiVes WhO ArE BeinG DisCRIminAtzed AgaInSt!!@@
Accounts under 100k are not being considered for review.
*Twitter is so not worth it.*
"I tried it years ago and thought ""why the fuck is this fun"" after a month or two.... and also noped out."
"Yes, I understand that it was more like a leveraged buyout than a purchase, but it wasn't free for him either.  He fought the deal when it looked like he couldn't get it as easily as he had hoped and discovered that there were other liabilities. He wound up selling $15 billion to help cover the deal."
"Might have been the only person he could sell to. Twitter was notoriously unprofitable. And maybe Dorsey was tired of running it. He sold to someone who could afford to lose it all, AND musk's incompetence can take the blame when it crashes."
"If you owned a slo-motion failing company, plagued by controversy, litigations and ""twit-feuds"" (yes, deliberate wording) ... and some Idiot offered you roughly $44 billion, what would you do ? (for perspective: Husky Energy Inc. is only Valued at $33.122 billion)

Me: ""Thanks, c'ya"""
"They're pretending it is, but look behind the curtain and you'll see a bunch of uber-rich fucks who have a vested interest in keeping the rest of us from communicating honestly."
"Right? They want to be victims so damn badly. What's that saying ... when you're accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression."
"Either twitter is an incredible resource meant to disseminate information to the masses and should be protected, or it’s a wildly unprofitable entity and it doesn’t matter who owns it so who cares. But it can’t be both, you can’t be mad at musk for ruining something vital to information whilst not mad at dorcy for selling something that doesn’t matter."
"I don’t prop twitter up as this vital entity so I would sell, dorcy, as it has been shown (please don’t hate me for this guts I know this is a liberal sub but facts are facts) used twitter to shape certain political spheres, if it’s that important maybe he should have been more discerning about the buyer?"
That is a brilliant quote.
"Um, it CAN be both? There are countless ways to disseminate information. Twitter was a good one, but if it becomes a place for hate speech and revenge porn, let it die. 

And something can be popular, but still unprofitable. When CSI was canceled, it was the no 1 scripted show on TV. But with actor and producer salaries going up every year, it was just too expensive to keep making."
"Not funny. Nightmare fuel. 

Remember when we laughed about ""President Trump""?"
Everybody is laughing now with Biden as well...
Oh yeah...
"Yeah, everyone ""with Biden"" is laughing their ass off at the idea that your lord and savior Agent Orange thinks he can bullshit his way out of the tornado toilet swirling he's swimming in after so boldly showing the world what a horribly despicable excuse for a human being that he is."
"Who are we talking about here? Of course he had a say in the schemes - look at his history of cheating, scheming and scaming. Probably learned from his father."
"Trump never built anything, paid for anything, or did anything worthwhile.  

His main skill is avoiding taxes and responsibility for his actions."
Trump wanted to reduce the company’s tax obligations—no doubt about it.
It is as believable as his inauguration crowd being bigger than Obama's. TFFG speaks truth only by accident.
Given that they still employ Weisselberg? No.
Being a criminal and con man is hisi birthright.  Of course he knew.  Who doesn't believe he knew? Those maggots that fall for his con.
Only Trumpers Who would literally kill for the man.
He knew.
More like IMPOSSIBLE to believe.
"I don't know him personally,  but I'm sure he was told. I suspect he just cared more about hamburgers, soft drinks, and grabbing crotches."
"He not only knew, he was likely controlling them"
*Donald Trump might not be intelligent but he does know of the illegal activities and schemes within his organization and he is a chronic and compulsive liar just like his more intelligent daddy was. It runs in the Trump family.*
It's not hard to believe if you're a MAGAt. It's impossible to believe if you're not.
"""best businessman ever has no idea what's going on in his company"""
Here is something I would like to clarify. Are we talking about getting to use a company car? Not only this but I'm just using this as an example that I would like as a benefit to a job. If I get a company car is that an off the books benefit?
I'd find it hard to believe that he didn't suggest the idea from the get-go.
"I believe that not only did Trump know about, but he devised the scheme and signed off on other executives doing the same thing. 

He's a Conman. Plain and simple."
Well thanks to chickshit Alvin Bragg he'll never been pressed about it.
I’m a great businessman. But not good enough to know what happens to money in my company.
"Fred Trump was a notorious slumlord. Woody Guthrie even wrote a song about him:

https://youtu.be/hh1QXhqXDbU"
"I read somewhere that if he would have handed the money he inherited to a broker to invest instead of doing what he's done with it, he would be well ahead of where he is right now. That's how bad he was at making money."
"A company car on the books is fine. A company car off the books is not. That’s the issue. When you get a company car or whatever perk, it’s a benefit that is reported. Our company has to report our weekly laundry service to the IRS and we pay taxes on it. Whatever the benefit, if it’s not reported, it’s fraud."
Ok. I must have missed that part. That does make sense.
What crap article is this
I will assume that it's more desperation distraction and just down vote and move on.
Well seems like it was well founded at this point.
"Sure bot, sure"
"FBI trailing the mouthpiece of a known criminal is smart policing, imo..."
Government surveillance has gotten out of hand. How do we stay one step ahead of anyone trying to monitor us?
Lack of police oversight with teeth leads to abusive police retaining their jobs and corrupting whole departments (the “one bad Apple spoils the whole barrel” theory)
"40% beat their wives and they kill blacks 3X more than whites during routine contact (no arrest-able crime committed, sometimes they “accidentally” kill the victim.)

They’re overgrown hallway monitors, a lot of them are overtly racist and since there’s the “blue code of silence” and police union they operate with impunity and almost never see the consequences of their (often fatal) negligent incompetence. The taxpayers usually foot the bill for civil settlements and the cops just move to a new city and continue their malfeasance."
"Why do conservatives love police? Isn't dismantling government overreach what conservatives get hard over?

Police are needed in our society, nobody with half a brain cells would argue that.   However using a hammer on every screw, nail, tire change, and to cut holes in walls gives bad results.

Police departments are over funded and overstaffed in a lot of the country because of decades of political grandstanding. We see a continuous stream of undertrained good ol boys getting amnesty for horrific mistakes, bad behavior, and shooting on the job.

The point to the defund police movement was to reduce bad  police officers, invest in good ones via salary increases, and dispatch non-police socal workers to domestic disturbances.     The right turned in into a doom spiral of 'liberals want to get rid of all police'

So no, liberals don't hate police, liberals hate how many bad police are in the system.  It was bad branding, abused by the right.

By the way, all the thin blue/red line shit is technically against the US flag code. Just thought I'd let that irony sink in."
"What kind of question is this? True liberals don't dislike the police, they dislike police corruption."

"So my grandfather was a judge and always told me to respect the police. Well obviously I did because I loved him…. So it’s been interesting to see the respect dissipate.

Not *every* officer is bad - but many, many, many are. Their focus is on the wrong things (like in my hometown, just fucking give up on arresting people for pot.) other times, as we all know, if you’re black there’s a target on your back. 

I think police need to do more to be involved in communities and not not focus on just being the “authority.”"
They are trained to lie and can kill unarmed people with no consequences.

Really? What the heck. Can you forward me the study where it says 40% of them beat their wives? I just read two or three studies with yearly statistics of fatal shootings by police by race & white people killed seems to be doubled in comparison to black people. Is this true ?
"I don’t like police *period*. At least not how US police operate. 

Where I live, you call and they never show up. 

I had a woman intentionally crash her car into a uhaul I rented and even with a CC video from a neighboring business they refused to charge her with anything. They threatened to arrest/detain me for yelling at her.

Relying on cops to police other cops is “lack of oversight”. They have incentives not to do so.

Black people seem to be the minority in terms of police shootings. I don't think there's a way to put a statistic regarding domestic abuse considering most of the time it happens behind closed doors, not only by police officers."
"Your link literally states:
""Additionally, the rate of fatal police shootings among Black Americans was much higher than that for any other ethnicity""

The raw number is less important than the rate based on population."
Okay so we’ve gone from “conservatives are basically Nazis because of many policy similarities and many of their fringe figures being openly Nazi” to “some of the most famous figures on the right are openly praising Hitler and it’s important that POTUS speak out against actual Hitler.” Which means that basically “Hitler wasn’t that bad” is legitimately about to become a mainstream talking point because they can’t possibly be caught agreeing with Joe Biden.

Did we really need a presidential response to the ravings of a madman?
Yup. F'n amazing watching Obama speak in Georgia tonight and thinking we had him just 6 short years ago. What a difference. 180 degrees of it.
"No, but we did need a presidential response to the tacit approval of anti-semites by the Republican Party. And that's what we got."
So these hate filled morons don’t think straight people go to gay bars
Sickening
Fucking disgusting.
"I guess they're mad he stopped more LGBT+ people and their allies from being killed?

And maybe they don't get that he and his wife wanted to support their daughter's friend because they would never support a family friend if it meant going to a drag show.

And straight people go to drag shows all the time. In Nashville, there's actually a party bus with drag performers. In our group, there was one family of eight or so people celebrating a birthday; a woman who'd just turned 21 with her mom and her friend; a bachelorette party (we saw a lot of ""bachelorette"" themed stuff at some of the shops near Broadway); and my boyfriend and me. (We got a little ribbing for saying we were in town to go to a hockey game the next night.) I suspect most of us on the bus were straight."
Best place to dance!
"I am a 56 year old straight woman. I have not been to a straight bar since 1990. Many straight people go to gay bars! Many straight couples go. Most everyone has gay friends and/or family members, and many of us go at least once, just out of curiosity. Some of us realize that it is our happy place (some people don't go to clubs looking to hook up). This being said, I have met many straight men in gay bars who have told me they go there to meet the straight women who seem to love gay bars! Ha"
"I like hearing oposiving viewpoints so most the street I follow are thing I disagree with, so I genuinely would like to ask you a question, what are you're thoughts on Stephen Willeford?

When does he go to Ukraine?
I don't get it. He's against the US spying on its own citizens (understandable) but Russia is clearly much worse in that exact issue
"Lol, there is some amazing irony in there."
I don't think k he really has a choice to be honest.
So he can be mobilized now?
Sad to see a patriot only find safe haven with an enemy
This is just embarrassing for us. We should have let him come back ages ago.
"How many Americans have emigrated because of how their government behaves?

How many Russians have?

A ratio nowhere near even.

The word IRONY is dysmally inappropriate for this circumstance.

But I simply cannot think of another word or expression for the situation of Edward Snowden.

an incongruous paradox?"
Next Comes Trump.
"It’s stunning to me the way most liberals just go along with the state line about Snowdens character/intent. Snowden never wanted any of this. It’s totally possible that he did, in the process of revealing state secrets, commit crimes that he should do time for, but it’s also true that American citizens were usefully informed by Snowden’s revelations of government over reach in their mass surveillance programs. 

He should be allowed to make his case and stand trial."
Perfect timing
He’s a hero regardless of citizenship
"Their loss, dude is a dollar short."

Hopefully we’ll revoke his US citizenship and bar him from the US."

That would be hilarious
He’s too valuable as a propaganda icee to go
😆
"Sadly he is 39, too old for conscription"
One of the very few countries that wouldn’t extradite him.
"I doubt he supports Russia spying on its citizens but everyone already knows they do. Unless he wants to spend his life in an American prison, he will likely do the empty bullshit that the Russian government asks him to."
">Lol, there is some amazing irony in there.

i'm pretty sure i heard him call that out himself."
De jure: yes. De facto: no. He's too valuable alive and free in Russia than dead or captured in Ukraine.
"You know, I kind of feel the same way. He exposed a huge civil rights violation and this is what happens. 

Terrible message."
Any port in a storm.
He can come back whenever he wants.
"> He should be allowed to make his case and stand trial.

The trouble is that the crimes he is accused of are strict liability crimes. Intent does not matter, hence he wouldn't be able to present it as a defense of sorts."
"BS, they take ‘em up to 65."
They will take any male they can find.
I mean I knew that Russia wouldn't extradite him and that's why he chose to stay but it doesn't explain why he seems to be so enthusiastic about it lol. As if Russia had the moral high ground on the topic.
"With years of prison time though, not exactly an open invitation."
"Does it matter at all that the program he exposed was ruled illegal?

"AFAIK, no."
"I mean, that's crazy. We don't have to just agree to the crazy."
Strict liability crimes exist. Espionage is not the only strict liability crime.
"Well aware of that, but I’m looking for something analogous to observing a crime where the system is arguing that ignoring the crime was the correct course of action. Which is why I brought up Moalin."
"I love that he thinks the problem is that people are just focusing on all the terrible things he says.

It’s not about halting growth. It’s about keeping people out.

I usually end up thinking it's good that it's out in the open because in order to solve a problem you have to admit it is a problem in the first place, so being out in the open makes it very hard to deny.

"There are some poor aspects to this article.  Energy analyst predicts a recession because...of no reason.  Apparently, Venezuela might make up for some nonexistent oil shortage because...it ranks #28 in world oil production?

Where are you that electric is that cheap? It’s around 12¢ in Texas. Our MachE only adds $15-20/month to the bill though. Still way cheaper than gas.

Finally. Someone that wasn’t a child when chocolate chip cookies were invented.
My inner grammarian has questions
Is 52 too old too?  Is the left-wingers out there gonna gripe that the Dems didn't pick someone in their 30s?
Is this supposed to be a jab at something? Is pointing out the huge age disparity between politicians and the people they represent bothering you?
"The average House member age for this Congress was 58 and some change. Choosing a 52 year old for a high profile leadership position seems about right. 

You seem more committing to being anti “left-winger” than entertaining the idea that they might have any good ideas."
"I'm 54 and the people who have represented me get closer to my age every year. 

Seriously, ageism was even more popular when Boomers were children. E.g. ""Don't trust anyone over 30""."
">I'm 54 and the people who have represented me get closer to my age every year.

First of all, that's half my point. You shouldn't wait until you've retired to be the same age as the average congress member to be represented.

My second point is that congress is actively getting older."
"Age is just a number. 30 years from now, when young people today are my age, they'll have realized that all their peers didn't share the same views, after all. The Gen Z white supremacists who are stirring up shit today, will still be stirring up shit and Gen WhoseNext will be blaming Gen Z for all of the world's problems.

No.

I just searched it & found multiple articles supporting that it shouldn’t be said & that the correct political term should be “primary bedroom” New York Times/ cnn/ cbs & other sources also said this even Dating back to 2020"
"Oh good grief, the left has adopted racism to counter opposition to what was once sound policy criticism. Well duh soon every comment becomes racial. I am an old conservative oblivious to race. Go figure."
I’m going to say that this is false. When we were house hunting two years ago we noticed there were no longer master bedrooms in any of the floor plans when they were put in the online listing. We obviously grew up calling it this and asked our realtor about it and they said they’ve started moving away from calling it that because it can be seen as offensive. We live in a very liberal state (MA) so I suspect there is some truth that some liberals consider it to be racist.
For the kinky….

I never said I was bothered by it and just because you aren’t either doesn’t mean it isn’t a thing. It’s one thing to say it doesn’t exist and another to say you aren’t bothered by it.
