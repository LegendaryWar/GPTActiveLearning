I imagine the Florida Subs going to have a meltdown here at some point
"Good that Florida is joining the ranks. 

Sad that still half the country doesn't already have this. But 100% will never happen. Democrat states will never allow it."
2A is pretty clear.
Every state should be Constitutional carry....it's the absolute law.
">Florida is the 26th state with laws on the books allowing permitless carrying of firearms  
  
I assume this majority situation is purely symbolic rather than having any legal effect but still, damn this is huge. The second amendment is as strong as ever. The right of the people to keep and bear arms  
  
#SHALL
#NOT  
  
be infinged."
"Wait what does this mean for Florida, I'm out of the loop.

I've watched a lot of that fisherman guy who open carries, is that fishing rule no longer nessessary for him?"
New York will be passing new gun laws in response to Florida passing the constitutional carry law.
"Let everyone carry nationwide for a month, see how much the crime drops"

"Prior to 2020 I probably would‚Äôve been one of those clowns freaking out about this too. I *used* to believe in ‚Äúcommon sense gun laws‚Äù then I saw the country devolve into absolute tyranny.

 Now I‚Äôm a firm believer in ‚Äúshall not be infringed‚Äù and I‚Äôm trying to move to a state with these laws. My city is a total liberal shithole overrun with crime and I‚Äôm sick of being defenseless."
"That's just Monday. And Tuesday. And all the other days. 

I'm a Floridian and I'm pleased as punch with this change. My only concern is I haven't seen whether this also gets rid of the silly 3 day waiting period in Florida. Part of the reason I got my permit in the first place was so I wouldn't have to wait 3 days to bring my own property home."
When does that cesspool not have a meltdown ?
I actually wonder if enough states go constitutional carry that SCOTUS might make a ruling that would effectively give constitutional carry nationwide.
Democrat states are already actively ignoring recent judicial rulings.
As someone who visits the worst gun control states: it's all virtue signalling. People vote for anti-cc laws but many of them carry weapons themselves.
Can't wait to see how they claim this is what a Stalin or Castro would do.
Democrat DA‚Äôs will give amnesty to criminals for illegal guns only
">	The law allows eligible citizens 21 years of age and up to carry without asking the government for a permit and without paying a fee.

Seems to be more than symbolic thankfully."
"But the Founders never imagined an *automatic* gun! 

*Uh, the Founders never imagined the internet, either.*

THATS (D)IFFERENT!"
What makes it symbolic? So its not actually legal?
"Open carrying is only legal in Florida when you're in the wild (hunting or fishing), or on the way to or from the wild. This doesn't change that. What does change is that he won't need a permit to conceal his weapon in the bait shop or grocery store on the way out for a nice weekend on the boat."
"It means that as long as you're 21 years old and up, you can concealed carry any legally owned firearm without needing to apply for a license.

""Constitutional carry"" usually implies open carry, which the Florida bill does **NOT** do - it's still basically illegal to open carry in most situations. The fisherman guy is basically staging a pro-2A protest. It's legal to open carry while hunting or fishing - so he just carries a fishing pole and several guns, and walks towards bodies of water to prove the point of how silly he believes that rule is."
"open carry is usually legal even in many anti-2a states (although they restrict it wherever they can)

  Constitutional carry generally gets rid of the need of a permit to conceal carry"
"Criminals already are, we should let law abiding citizens do the same."
that's the worst part of it! You can't be victimized for wanting to defend yourself from actual physically violent criminal behavior. The perpetrators of the crimes are considered victims of society
Yea I can't wait to move to Florida myself so much freedom there.
"> ‚Äúcommon sense gun laws‚Äù 

Just look at what common sense tik tok laws look like."
Love how a lot of pro-gunners were anti-gunners themselves at first. I know cause I was one too.
"The gay marriage ruling, if they decide to use it as precedent, might make it happen. That was part of the justification for forcing marriage to be accepted in all states."
"They enact anti-2a laws, judge shoots it down, they rescind it, and enact another similar law. Rinse and repeat. 

If a Republican state did that, the democrat controlled media would be having a field day"
New York passed new gun laws in response to SCOTUS rulings. New York made any place people gather a 'sensitive area'. That means gun free zones.  All mass shootings have occurred in gun free zones. It's against NY law to have and wear a bullet proof vest. New York criminals have a distinct advantage.
"I'm originally from Illinois so, yeah... I know exactly what you mean. Kind of Hippocratic if you ask me. They say I want to carry mine but no one else can carry. So yeah..."
Why symbolic?
"Just the notion of ""a constitutional-carry-majority nation"". From what I understand after reading the article it doesn't seem like that is a legally meaningful term outside of symbolism. I do think the symbolism is quite powerful though as it shows there is very strong support for the 2A in America! :)"
"Even if you have the right to open carry, I don't think it's wise. If a POS wants to do something evil, he'll take you out first. Of course, there's the argument that if he sees an open-carry, he might reconsider..."
It would be a very interesting month that‚Äôs for sure
Ehhhhh its not perfect but it ain't California
It's the problem is a lot of them are now pro-gun but they'll still vote Democrat
I just might die of laughter if by forcing states to accept gay marriages Democrats ultimately make states accept out of state carry permits.
"If someone gave Liberty Doll her own media channel, this type of hypocrisy would blasted non-stop."
Ooh you mean nationwide. But the actual FL law will be legal correct?
"Agreed. I've lived in places with open carry and have always supported it, but if I'm going somewhere I feel the need to carry, I prefer to keep it concealed."
"I think that ruling was a horrible act of judicial activism. But if the court plans on keeping it around as precedent, might as well. The difference is that marriage has no basis in the constitution while the 2nd amendment does. So this might have more legitimacy with such an argument."
Definitely
"But now you don't have to pass an arbitrary ""what is concealed"" test.  I don't know about you, but up here in WI a lot of CC'ers are pretty obvious about what they're carrying."
The way the bill is written it seems like it‚Äôs only purpose is to trample the first amendment
He‚Äôs right you know
He‚Äôs right you know
durrrrr freedum of speech dont mean freedum from consequences /s
"Bill should have been one sentence. 

They're going after vpn usage here xD"
"No, no.

It‚Äôs also there to trample on the 4th amendment."
So right you said it twice.
And I‚Äôll keep saying it lol
I highly doubt Trump will stop talking
"This might have been their plan the whole time.  Take a case the state will likely lose and use it as a vehicle to place gag orders on a presidential candidate throughout the election.  

It has been reported that the trial might not even take place until after the election so that would give democrats the ability to prevent trump from speaking on anything that is polling well for him (like weaponization of government, political persecution, etc)."
Doubt that the gag order would prevent selective leaks from the democrats.
"‚ÄúWhen you remove a man‚Äôs tongue you do not prove him a liar, you only show that you fear what he might say‚Äù"
From the same Democrat courts that prosecute robbery **victims** and not the criminal that tried to murder the innocent person.
a single NY judge has the power to throw this country in to utter chaos. And i'm sure they're loving every second of it.
"Lol. Our fake charges are now being silenced by a gag order cause it‚Äôs not about guilt or the trial, it‚Äôs about the headline reading we arrested trump.

Kangaroo court"
"DO IT. PLEASE PLEASE DO IT.

See how that goes"
"I can‚Äôt see this upheld if they do impose one. Gag orders are already murky, and they want to oppose one on a former president and current presidential candidate? This already isn‚Äôt going to be a fair trial. There‚Äôs nothing that Trump could say, that he hasn‚Äôt already said, that would bias the trial any further than it is."
Manhattan Judge overplays his hand giving second term for DJT.  More news at 11.
"We're all in uncharted territory. Gag orders don't normally violate the 1st amendment, but this one, during campaign season, with leaks coming out of the da's office, absolutely would."
Time for civil disobedience.
"He needs yo just have an ""anonymous source"" leak out whatever he wants known. 2 can play the game."
Think about it: is a person who puts duct tape on another persons mouth a good person or a bad person? Is that something a good or a bad person does?
"Good luck with that, your ""honor"""
Go to another judge and get it removed.
Trump's biggest downfall is he doesn't know when to stop talking lol they're giving the man a gift.
L O L
Then he can make those cool memes with duct tape on his mouth.
More and more of a kangaroo court daily...
Gag order should be challenged in federal court.  This is a political trial and Trump has 1st amendment rights.  Courts shouldn't be allowed to shut down speech that they don't like.
This has to be an onion headline
What a shit showüòî
Whelp. This is becoming more fucked by the day.
"Trump has a lot of fight in him. Wish we didn‚Äôt have to resort doing it.  Whether he talks and goes to jail or he is exonerated, this country is majorly fcuked beyond repair. The cancer has metastasized and it‚Äôll be a matter of time before it‚Äôll be over. The left ruined everything."
The response to Trump telling someone not to talk about something is to tell Trump to not talk about something.
"Stupid question, but how does a judge have the power to even give a gag order?"
"Don't ""gag orders"" on a case typically apply to the defendants *and* the prosecution."
That judge should be impeached.
good luck with that!! /s
Good luck enforcing that ‚Ä¶
Bwahahahahaa!
Honestly this might be the best thing that happens to Trump.  The chances he fires off some insult or attack on the judge or says something that could be twisted into him making threats are high.
Haha that's rich
Good luck with that!
How is something like that even legal/Constitutional to tell someone they're not allowed to talk about their own trial?
"Then they will jail him.

Never thought I would see an American Alexei Navalny in my lifetime but here we are...."
That‚Äôs the point.  They have NOTHING on him.  They‚Äôll use his breaking the gag order to have SOMETHING.
Obviously. He will not speak. He will furiously type on Truth Social and do another rally.
"The judge cannot tell Trump he can't talk.  The gag order has to be very specific to the case, which in this case is anything to do with Stormy Daniels.  I'm sure they'll try to expand that gag order, but the reality is he could sue the state and SCOTUS would knock that shit down in record time, like they have before."
A gag order concerning the trial would not prevent a candidate from campaigning and talking about issues.
" The 1st amendment right of a candidate, political speech, and a political party - the highest value speech that exists in the US. If the gag order impacts that, Trump and GOP can cause a lot of rightful uproar.  Itll be interesting to see how exactingly narrow any gag order would be.  Otherwise, I think its beyond stupid to not expect 10 fold blowback on the judge/state."
That's exactly what this is.
"So nasty, disgusting tactic."
"Yeah. Very convenient that, without a conviction, the judicial branch will stop him from campaigning and deplatform him."
This is what they did to Rick Perry.
That is clearly (D)ifferent....

"So, for some reason, I decided to watch Waco on Netflix, which then led to me watching a documentary about Ruby Ridge, which  led me to a documentary about the Montana Freeman.

I am from Oklahoma and remember exactly where I was and the horror of OKC bombing.

If January 6th taught us anything, it is that we will be treated differently, and if we move one step outside of the law, the government will use its full force of it against us, and diminish our message.

At this point, I honestly do not know what the answer is, but I know we have to play by the rules, or we can not effectuate change."
"Trump's biggest strength is he insists upon talking about things that are verboten by our uniparty overlords. Whenever he speaks publicly with a big enough megaphone, his approval rate climbs."
"100%.  If a gag order is put in place, he will hang himself...he just can't help it."
"Nope. This silences a presidential candidate throughout the duration of a campaign. Weaponization of government, corruption, political prosecution are all off the table for him if this happens."
"I get your point, but it's a really ominous infringement of the First Amendment... silencing a declared candidate for President?  This is the stuff dictators do."
More accurately they can hold him in contempt of a non federal court which may well trigger a dick waving contest with the secret service who definitely isn't letting him go to normal person jail and may not feel beholden to any state court
Does he not speak at rallies?
The Trump team must be giddy. You can‚Äôt buy this kind of publicity- and the idea of a local judge attempting to send a former President and current opposition front runner to jail over a ‚Äúgag order‚Äù is ludicrously newsworthy.
"But you know almost all questions to him are guaranteed to be framed in the context of the indictment, especially during debates, as a way to get him into saying a little *too* much, right? 

‚ÄúMr. President Trump, given your recent indictment, how can Americans expect x, y, and z?‚Äù 

‚ÄúMr. President Trump, given your recent indictment, why should Americans feel confident that you won‚Äôt be found guilty and thrown in jail?‚Äù 

While the gag order doesn‚Äôt necessarily stop him from talking about the economy, immigration, etc., he might not be able to control that once debates start coming around."
"With one of the issues, no doubt, being the persecution of political enemies by Soros backed District Attorneys."
"Short of actual civil war, nothing will stop them.  The democrats have refined the process to strip away constitutional rights from their opponents."
Not possible. This is N.Y. state court.
You actually can.
"> At this point, I honestly do not know what the answer is, but I know we have to play by the rules, or we can not effectuate change.

The rules were manipulated and corrupted to ensure that no change can be made while playing by the rules."
"I love this. Judge is like ""I'm holding you in contempt of court!"" and a secret service agent just stands up and says ""No. You're not."""
"> and may not feel beholden to any state court

....what?"
I mean the semantics don't really matter when your running for president.  Putting him under house arrest is just as bad as jail when you need to be on the road campaigning for President.
I meant it sarcastically. Impossible to shut this guy up.
"US security has been based off Patriots signing up to defend the constitution, some thing people are willing to die for to defend. We as an empire can't last if people loss faith in our country because we are having our degraded"
Oh you absolutely can.  My ex gf was one in Kentucky a couple of years back for a teachers' protest.
"I don't disagree.  Again, I really don't know the answer."
"Judge: I'm holding you in contempt

Trump: I'm holding **you** in contempt.

Judge: you aren't the judge you can't do that. 

Trump: not that kind of contempt. I meant the other definition"
"The secret service has already made it clear Trump can't be arrested the traditional way or put behind bars. He will remain in their custody. 

Traditionally a gag order violation would result in contempt of court which would put him in with Gen pop. Which again, isn't happening. So the Judge would be ordering the secret service to... place him under house arrest... maybe?  I'm not convinced the secret service think the judge has the right to order them to do that. I'm not even convinced he does"
Trump doesn't live in NY anyway... so typically you aren't beholden to them anyway unless they work something out with your local state.
"Biden didnt go on the road to campaign. ""Most popular"" candidate ever."
I wonder if this is why America has always avoided charging a president for a petty crime?
"It's true, most popular with the undead ever. My dead cat voted for Biden fourteen times."
I‚Äôm old enough to remember that being conspiracy theory. Ya know. 2 months old
What happened to they were jamming it so the balloon couldn't collect any data?
"Biden‚Äôs foreign policy:

-Get 13 Americans killed in a botched withdrawal of Afghanistan 

-Loan the Taliban a whole bunch of expensive equipment in aforementioned botched withdrawal 

-Let Russia invade Ukraine and then form an alliance with our biggest adversary China

-Let China fly surveillance balloons across the entire continent when you were aware of its intentions well in advance 

-Totally cede control of the southern border to the cartels"
"The balloon had a self-destruct mechanism that could have been activated remotely by China

   So, in other words.... China sent an explosive device into our territory. This admin is so weak and fearful of China this will go with no repercussions. Worse... This is a sign to China that this behavior is perfectly acceptable and will have no repercussions..."
I still think it‚Äôs funny China uses ballons
No shit Sherlock!   Why else did they deploy it....
"I know conservatives are upset about this story but counter espionage 101 is if you know your enemy is spying on you, you don't alert him to that, you let them see what you want them to see

It's a fucking balloon they had time to figure where it would be and stage areas. 

The narrative that the same government and military that accidentally bombs a middle eastern school twice a year suddenly got all trigger shy with missiles doesn't add up. 

And since this post nearly defends the regime I'll close with a let's go Brandon!"
"This is the media cycle. Something happens, government and corporate press gaslight for a month, then admit to what actually happened (despite most of us knowing what the deal was from the start).

See vaccines, lockdown, inflation, war in Ukraine, political/legal persecution of Republicans, rising crime rates, weaponization of federal agencies‚Ä¶ the list goes on."
"Funny how we didn't hear about the balloons for months, and all of the sudden we get dripped new info the day Trump goes to NY. The administration wants this story buried

While we're at it, how goes the Biden confidential documents roundup?"
No shit huh?
The Biden team caught in yet another lie.  We are going to be speaking Mandarin in the next ten years if the Democrats keep selling us out like this.
Its a good thing biden stalled and hid it from everyone to make sure they got the job done completely.
Another great job by clueless Joe.
Folks the reason it was let across the country is the military wanted to study the signals that it was using. The whole time it was over the US it had the new U-2 variant over top of it and other data snoopers around it at all times. This was a windfall for us. They were no doubt looking at nuclear sites and bases. But we knew exactly were it was at all times so we just buttoned up and reduced emissions when they got close. There isn't much info the balloon could have collected that a satellite couldn't have. Now we on the other hand got to monitor in real-time the Chinese emissions and signals. We knew the exact time and location of all transmissions and what signals they sent at those times. The Chinese are going to have to change there ciphers and data collecting means now that we have a good idea how the operatate. If they don't them the are morons and opening themselvesup to exploitation. And in addition we got the parts after we shot it down. We are gonna have a good look at how they set up there electronics things like there EM collection and camera technology so we can exploit any design flaws. They should after this make big changes but who knows. I know we conservatives like to criticize anything the government or military is involved in but this is a rare we shouldn't. According to reports biden wanted to shoot it sown right away but the military convinced him otherwise. This was the pragmatic view.
What?! CNN said it was ‚Äúonly‚Äù a innocent weather balloon that blew off course!
"Hey, no shit.

It's getting so tiresome to say something and then watch the rest of the world (and especially the press) go from ""This isn't happening, and you're a lunatic for believing it."" To, ""well, maybe it happened, but it probably didn't, and you're still a nut for believing it."" To ""Okay, it is happening, but let's pretend like we all knew that all along."""

"China's ""Pearl Harbor"" will come any week now.  And the sad thing is, the radical left sides with *them*.  Fascism has been rebranded ""state capitalism"" and it's their new thing."
"Uh yeah? Look at its path, you can already tell it saw everything.

Came through Alaska, where our first strike bombers would launch from, down though Montana where our Nuclear arsenal is, stopped by Fort Knox to scope out our gold reserves."
THIS‚Ä¶.is nothing short of treason. To allow a spy balloon to fly over the United States and its military bases reeks of collusion. Biden and his administration should be removed immediately before we all suffer dearly.
I call BS.  China has satellites why would they send up balloons like it‚Äôs 1914?
"Somebody‚Äôs watching us. I‚Äôm being serious. Our every move, our dissents, divisions, addictions, arguments. All of it. They must have their reasons."
"If only they had shot it down before it flew over the US.

anyhow..."

"I hate to be that guy, but loan would assume eventual return and/or reimbursement. That equipment was given."
"> Loan the Taliban a whole bunch of expensive equipment in aforementioned botched withdrawal

Every time I bring this up, people downplay it by saying, ""They're obsolete so it's not a big deal."" As if several armies don't still use them. I'm talking about the Humvee, still used by most of our allies. Just because we don't use them anymore doesn't mean they can't be used."
Wait...didn't it get unveiled that during the last president's time in office 3 of these balloons were caught to be flying around the United States as well?
the balloon saw nothing a satellite couldn't find. It was the right call to let it pass and recover it at sea. This criticism isn't real.
This is the third balloon that they have found flying in our nation in the past 10 years and neither Trump nor Biden did anything....the last 2 presidents have been horrendous. Please bring back people that care about the United States...
"How's it funny? It has excellent loiter on target capability to soak up sigint. Combine this with them laser range finding the waters around ssbn ports, its damn obvious they are establishing a baseline. A balloon is a relatively cost effective intel suite, probably a few hundred grand with what hardware they likey had on board.

They pulled off a master class victory: take advantage if pattern of incompetence of balloons floating over, steer this one to cause political mischief by monitoring or doing low level sigint over selected target to generate a physical and poitical response to see ""what happens."" They got everything they needed to know. Including how F22's would be utilized with minor info pickup during that encounter. Also, that politcal gamesmanship trumps all. Smarter play would have been to do like the preceeding times.  Watch, dont change behavior, or spoof and manipulate with bad data ... that would have been the better response than whatever spectacle happened.

We do the same, but with different packages.  Some areas we are better in and some we may not be.

China plays by *very* different rules and theory and has had the benefit of observing our parties turning military into a constituent benefits program."
"It's actually very very smart. They specifically wanted signals intel, particularly what is being send from our nuclear bases up to satellites - I'm sure most people know that China is fast developing anti-satellite weapons so they can take out US comms, GPS etc. if war breaks out.

Another satellite can't do that. 

 Flying a plane over US nuclear bases would get them shot down pretty quick, and also means they are only near a base for a few seconds.

A balloon is unlikely to be shot down (well, until recently anyway), moves slowly and at a good altitude for sig intel of this type, has better deniability etc."
"It does add up if you consider the mistaken bombings as a mixture of arrogance and incompetence.

Managing what someone sees is far harder in practice than it is in theory."
"The entire world knew our enemy was spying on us, and China knew that. You also just gave an example of how our military can make mistakes as an argument for why there's no way they made the wrong move here..."
"It's much easier to sleep at night if you believe these statements. I'm honestly not so sure anymore, though. There does ""exist"" a possibility that we are not a VASTLY superior country with extremely capable and intelligent people in charge."
"Probably was.  The Chinese have hundreds of spy satellites that can read the writing on a dime.  

I assume this was just some sort of diversionary non story"
"If I‚Äôm to be honest, I‚Äôm betting the Covid bucks didn‚Äôt help much with that either."
The adults are in charge again!
"people are really, really underestimating the importance of this. Ending the petrodollar would have catastrophic results domestically."
"The balloon was a signals intelligence collection platform, those are things that satellites most definitely can‚Äôt ‚Äúsee‚Äù. They should have and could have shot it down as soon as discovered as there was very little risk in doing so."
"Because a balloon with a data-gathering device attached is primitive and it's not subtle. It's what a goblin from World of Warcraft would slap together. Every country spies on everybody else but they do it with things like computer viruses, drones, human agents, etc.

I don't really trust the government's claims about this balloon in the first place, but if it really was a ""spy balloon"" then the Chinese are even less advanced than we thought."
"I would caution that we conservatives are also guilty of negativity and falling into our own echochambers. China is a threat but its not as bad as many conservative talking heads argue. The Chinese are in just as bad if not worse then us. Their demographics are falling currently. They reversed the one child, two child, and three child policy but it has absolutely gutted their demographics. Urbanization is also contributing to the falling demographics as China is the fastest urbanizing country on earth. China also imports the vast majority of raw materials most importantly fuel and food. They are terrified of the losing those imports because they can't survive without those imports currently. There is more but you get my point. Yes we have extreme domestic issues and that is what I am most fearful of. We have the ability and means to be food and fuel independent and still have vast access to raw materials and one of the most skilled and efficient  work forces on earth but we restrict ourselves and tie our hands behind our back. We are self sabotaging and much of it is because of insane leftist domestic policies. Sorry for the long winded response but history, military, and geopolitics has been a love of mine since I was a boy. America is in rough spot but we should not fall into despair."
We're building back better!
"the US does it's signal collection all the way out at GEO.

low earth orbit CAN collect signal info in the same way a balloon can.

plus it's not like their signals can capture anything useful. It's all has military grade cryptography.

so no, shooting it was not the right call. I think I can trust our military (not biden) on their strategy. republicans are trying to use this as a way to hate biden but it's incredibly ignorant to actually believe that."
"Yet it managed to traverse the entire continental US, transmitting intel the entire time.  Sounds pretty effective to me.

Perhaps we should be staffing our intelligence and defense services with ""goblins"""
"This thing was comically huge.  Slowly floating over the entire United stated with advanced surveillance equipment.  They probably expected it to be intercepted, or maybe they've been getting away with it for a while already.  Either way we let it happen.

Drones can't have that kind of payload.  Human spies certainly exist, and are known to sleep with members of congress, but they can't carry a ton of equipment and fly around looking for secret bases.  Idk what level of sophistication you're expecting, but this is the real world, and the sci-fi shit you're imagining doesn't exist."
No more mean tweets!!!!1!!!
"I‚Äôve got over 20years in SigInt, take that for what it‚Äôs worth. LEO and GEO sats aren‚Äôt on station long enough to provide the coverage mapping of a balloon doing figure 8‚Äôs over a specific target at balloon speed. The US does TONS of ground based collections because as collection goes, the closer you are to the xmit source the more complete you collection is going to be, ‚Äúheight makes might‚Äù in transmitting, it‚Äôs nearly the opposite for collection. Cryptography can be cracked, and not every comms device used by government, contractors or military is encrypted, especially the mundane day to day work. 

Never mind that the US tracked the balloon since it‚Äôs departure from Hainan and had the entire Pacific Ocean to prepare for a take down once it entered US airspace, offshore west coast. You know why I don‚Äôt trust the military? Because I‚Äôve served in it, seen some of the people that are retained and promoted within it (particularly officers), and watched them lie for decades. They also admitted, their goal was less about ‚Äúsafety‚Äù and moreso counterintel (the ability to recover more of the platform intact). We can certainly disagree about the value of whether that was the right call, I maintain it was not given they knew what it was not (a weather balloon) very early in its flight and not knowing it‚Äôs payload or capabilities, allowed it to traverse the continent AND broadcast its intelligence back to Beijing. That‚Äôs poor NatSec by every definition."
"a satellite cannot collect images as efficiently as a high altitude balloon,the lenses has to capture images of whatever through stratosphere and the atmosphere while a balloon only deals with atmosphere..

think of driving down the road and 400 meters in front of your vehicle you see on the road what appears to be water but this keeps moving with you‚Ä¶it‚Äôs heat coming off the road‚Ä¶this is what satellites deal with‚Ä¶.space is cold‚Ä¶earth is warm."

So the meme maker yelled fire in a crowded theater? I‚Äôm confused. What exactly is your point?
">	You also can‚Äôt yelled ‚ÄúFire‚Äù in a movie theater when there is no fire, no matter how much of a meme you may think it is. 

Yes, you can. This is not illegal in the US."
"This was literally argued in court and you can, in fact, yell fire in a crowded movie theater and it is protected free speech. Now whether or not you should is a different conversation."
When was that?
"Dude wore a MAGA hat. Fool. Same thing happened on the other side, she wasn't prosecuted. There is no internet equivalent of yelling FIRE in a movie theater."
"It was posted here on the day he was convicted, I'm not inclined to do a search for you. Both posts were telling voters to text a number to avoid having to go to the polls. He had a MAGA hat on, it should have been clear that it was a joke. She had nothing identifying which side she was on."
Concealed carry permits: a background check to carry the gun you already passed a background check to obtain.
"Constitutional carry is a step in the right direction, but it is better to get your State's permit.

With my State permit I'm allowed on school grounds(not in the buildings) for any legitimate purpose, such as dropping off a child."
"And it‚Äôll be conveniently overlooked if crime rates in the state actually *drop*, disproving the entire democrat narrative of ‚Äúmore guns = more crime‚Äù"
"> DeSantis Signs Bill Into Law

And here is just another in the long line of examples of why Florida is successful. Because the Florida Legislature is creating and passing the right laws. DeSantis had absolutely nothing to do with writing the bill or bringing it into law in the State except for simply putting his signature on it to approve it."
"This couldn't be more false.

Concealed carry permits are a way to get gun owners on a list despite it being unconstitutional to do so."
"Because he's never signed an executive action...

Also, governors never telegraph what kind of bills they'll sign to the legislature. Nope. They just happen across them when they come to their desk."
"Since you're bouncing around crying about DeSantis and simping for Trump, have you thought about an answer to my comment on that other post asking how you can defend Trump after he said ""take the guns first, due process later""?


Edit: pretty sure the mods removed your response on the other post. I can't see it unless I stalk your profile."
Just don't look too deep into DeSantis or you might be disappointed. Doesn't he support red flag laws? Seems like an odd thing to go after Trump for if you are pushing DeSantis. Given what Trump has gone through at this point and all the corruption he's experienced I'd expect him to be more receptive of arguments rooted in government mistrust.
"I'm not supporting anyone in particular at the moment, DeSantis may very well be the wrong guy for the job. I think the Republican party has a lot of sorting out to do before we find the right candidate, and Trump is the first person on the list of those being sorted out. He's gone through a lot, but he also has no commitment to civil liberties and free market principles. He brought in protectionism, gun control, and in many ways marched the party toward authoritarianism. Why did we tolerate that?"
"I think that's a pretty big misrepresentation of what his position is.

I mean yes he brought in protectionism for example... but why did he do that? It was a means to an end of more free trade, not less. E.g. he imposed tariffs on Canada in order to try to get them to open the market on dairy. Likewise he wanted to pressure China to open up their markets. If anything, covid proved Trump's policy correct because it highlighted the problems with unfair trade regulations that distort the market and create a one-sided dependence without mutually assured destruction, which is also a national security and foreign influence issue.

Consider you already have a tax on people who play sports - let's say you charge them extra income tax. Trump comes along and imposes another tax on everyone else to make it even. But you then criticize him for distorting the marktet and being against ""free market"" principles. It's really based on an incorrect understanding on your part.

Another example would be the border - on the surface it seems like someone who supports ""civil liberties"" should support a more open border, but we have entitlements in this country that force citizens to pay for it... so it's actually LESS consistent with liberty to support open borders, unless you also combine that with massive entitlement reform (which there is no public support for). There are nuanced issues. Sometimes to maximize net freedom you have to restrict freedom. Anarchy - a society where people are allowed to infringe on the liberty of others for example - is ultimately one that is less free.

I find it odd you think anything from Trump himself has moved us toward authoritarianism. It's clear from his discussions that's not what he wants at all. So that's a really strange accusation, especially when you consider the alternatives to him...

I mean if he was like Obama wouldn't he have just shut down the Russia investigation from the start? Wouldn't he have gone after his political opponents with his DOJ? The IRS? Wouldn't he have surrounded himself with his own people instead of trying to work with others in the establishment, who he did not know? Authoritarian Trump would have acted completely differently than what we actually saw. So that characterization makes no sense to me."
"Could just be who I follow and read, but it seems that no one who is at least following this bill thinks it‚Äôs good."
"So they can do anything they want and it can't be talked about regardless of the first amendment?  That's highly unconstitutional.

But it's clear from this effort, they're obviously planning to never allow fair elections again."
"That is the real goal, to suppress social media that isn't part of the propaganda machine."
A CCP bot has entered the room.
"Imo, the government needs to stay out of private businesses.  If a social media site allows things that people don't like then people will find alternatives and the social media site will be forced to change or suffer.    If the social media site allows things that the government does not like then too bad.  It's not their place to decide how a business operates and will be an unethical overreach of power to try to shut it down or suggest that certain people are banned 

Unpopular opinion here - I disagree that social media = freedom of speech but if that's the path people go down then that **is** forcing the government to get involved in private businesses and it will not end well for anyone."
If thats true then ill publically challenege the result of every election out of general protest.
"It is becoming clear TikTok is just a scapegoat to bring their disinformation czar into existence. I have noticed one thing about this administration, they will keep trying and trying until they succeed in their tyranny. If it isn't the infrastructure bill, it will be something else to stick it in. They have a long list of tyrannical items to do before the next election so they can get their own way again."
"Exactly, it‚Äôs fucking insane. Like these are American companies, unless they start hosting them in Iran or their parent companies get major investments from Russia, the bill very clearly can‚Äôt touch them"
"Banning private jets would be way more effective in curbing ""climate change"". But we all know this isn't really about the climate..."
How about we ban Biden from office?
"Clearly the right call by the Biden administration. I would much rather ban lightbulbs, gas stoves, and support trans rights than anything else.

We need to put the fentanol crisis, border crisis, US world standing, Chinas takeover of the global economy (countries switching to Yuan en mass), rampant crime, jailing of democrats political opponents, dictator like control of the media/social media, weaponization of the FBI, squashing political dissent, inflation, cost of living, and anti-white racism to the back of the line. 

Greta Turnburg said the world would end in 2023. But it hasn‚Äôt. Because we banned domestic production of oil/natural gas (and instead bought the same amount from other countries for a higher $), banned gas stoves, and are banning lightbulbs - that is PROOF that we have saved the world from global warming."
"Once the ban goes into effect, LED light bulbs will suddenly have a shortage, and the cost of the newer light bulbs will dramatically increase and remain more expensive. Load up on LED bulbs now."

Who even uses old school bulbs anymore? LEDs are superior in every single aspect and are completely affordable now
Wait this isn‚Äôt satire?
"This just in: Little known fact, light bulbs are the main proponent to systemic racism as when they were invented, only rich white males could purchase them. Persons of colors were only able to purchase matches and candles and even to this day 5% of whites own 99% of the world's light bulbs. So it's only fair that we ban these racist inventions. /s"
God this fucking administration is a dumpster fire.
"I think theres a bit of scare mo gering here,when in fact, the US are just trying to catch up with the rest of the world.
For a bit of context, the EU started phasing out incandescent bulbs over 10 years ago. At this stage, I can't even remember the last time i seen anold style bulb..

Technology has come a long way in quality and price, and if you use the correct Kelvin value, you can't even tell the difference between the two. I have never had to replace an LED bulb once, and they use very little electricity. 

Regardless of what Biden says, why would you want old shitty lights in your house  that cost you more money and have to be replaced all the time?"
Biden admin loooooooooves to take away and remove things from American lives. What positive have they actually added? I cannot think of a single one.
What did the leftist have before the candle?‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..electricity.
"Great, any more bright ideas?"
How long ago was it they pushed LEDs?
"I just wanna say LEDs are cool and all, but they are too bright imo. I like more mellow lighting, and idk if LEDs can offer me that. Also, this just reminds me back when I was a kid at my grandma's, and their lights put off yellow light, which just brought warmth and coziness into the household. 

I don't have any LED lighting at home. However, at work I've installed over 100 LED lights as we phase out flourecent. Fun stuff."

"All of the bulbs in my house are LED now, except for wall sconce mood lighting, antique lamps that show off the wire burning look, and the rooms that I have auto sensing switches (the LED lights never turn off). I also enjoy reading by my oil lamp at times.

There is a time and a place for different lighting styles. Let the people determine what they want in their homes!"
">LED light bulbs 'currently cost more than incandescent bulbs and are **inferior**,' consumer groups said in letter to U.S. Department of Energy

I have LED bulbs in most of my lighting throughout my home, with a few exceptions (i.e., the light inside the stove, oven hood, etc). How are they ""*inferior*"" to incandescent bulbs? They last longer, are dimmable across a wider range of brightness, use less energy, and the ones I have are BT/voice controlled, are automated to turn on/off in certain order at given times of day. They are pricey, though. 

>Overall, **47% use mostly or only LEDs**, 15% use mostly incandescent or halogens, and 12% use mostly or all compact fluorescent (CFL), with another **26% reporting no predominant bulb type**, the federal data showed. 

So almost half already use LED, and over a quarter probably have no idea what they use. Which leaves about a quarter divided between incandescent/halogen and CFLs."

LED bulbs actually offer you far more options of colour, you just need to know what you are looking for."
"You need to shop for both brightness (in lumens), and color temperature (measured in K), where a lower value is a ""warmer"" (less garish) light. Give a look at ""vintage-style"" bulbs. I've also found that the newer ""filament-style"" LEDs tend to be less 'harsh' than the older ones were."

"Mexico and Saudi Arabia (I think it‚Äôs Saudi) have agreed to switch to the Yuan. 

This is one of the biggest news stories of the decade and has not gotten any press. Ultimately, this will make the Chinese currency stronger and the US currency weaker.

Aside from that, this also weakens the US presence and dominance in the world. If countries use the U.S. dollar, we have leverage over what they do and how they interact with our adversaries. When the use the Yuan, we have no power to influence their decisions with money and give all the power to China."

The rest of my lights are LED because it makes sense. For rare instances, it doesn't make sense and I should get to make the decision."

If you listen to only the White House on Nashville you'd think a radical Christian killed a bunch of trans kids...
"Here is their stance summed up in a few sentences:

When will the shooter's manifesto be made available?
"Of course not. Because it doesn‚Äôt fit their agenda‚Ä¶ these people had different beliefs than them so what do they matter, right? Probably just a bunch of ‚ÄúMAGA republicans‚Äù, right?

It shouldn‚Äôt be about left and right, it should be about the fact lives were lost due to a tragic, targeted school shooting and about the cops‚Äô heroic response that saved countless other lives."
Biden's White house has shown to care more about the shooter than the victims.
"They also couldn't be bothered to show up after the Christmas Parade massacre. But they have had no problem showing up to visit the families of murders. This presidency makes Obama's look decent, and Obama sowed the seeds of all the division and corruption we see today."
To honor them would be to admit that they were killed by a terrorist.

Don't forget CNN is so busy talking about what Trump is doing tomorrow. You will not see this at all.It will be hidden from the public as much as possible.
"Biden's handlers have already forbidden him from mentioning Nashville again...they don't want CNN, MSNBC, and podcasters to have a reason to remind their listeners that it even happened.  Instead there will be a 957th recap of the Las Vegas shooting even though not a single new detail or a new second of security camera footage has been made available."
It is the kneejerk response of the Democrat/new millenium movement... they celebrate the enemies of America and are probably glad a few Christian kids got offed by this freakshow.
Because they are are celebrating the deaths of children at the hands of mental illness

I've never seen a group of people so into honoring or sympathizing with a child murderer before...the left is really clown world.

Biden should take a page out of George Costanza‚Äôs book.  Every instinct that Joe has is wrong and he should do the opposite.
"The NY post, really???"
If its the opposite they would
It doesn't fit into their narrative.
Great article. At least the POST knows who the real victims are.  It's par for the course for what the Democrats do.  I just shrug off their nonsense.  No matter how much they kvetch about transgender people feeling picked on I refuse to use their pronouns or acknowledge them whatsoever. To me they are degenerates preying upon innocent children with their mental disease.

I can't stand the politicization of literally anything and everything bad that happens. Can't we just treat people like they are people? What we need to do is more deeply understand the reasons the shooter did what they did so we can take a critical look at both mental health and gun control issues. In this instance the two are connected. We have to do what we can to ensure this kind of thing is less likely to happen in the future."
"I know I shouldn‚Äôt be surprised, but I am. I figured Biden would take any chance he could to bash guns, maybe even blame the victims a bit more and cry about how mean everyone is to the trans shooter."

"As soon as they redact all of the anti-Christian, violent, anti-white racist and everything else that changes the narrative of ‚Äúbullied trans‚Äù."
IT'S MA'AMIFESTO!
Prob never considering the Trans network told them not to release it or else
This is when we need a leak.
Hopefully never. The media needs to stop glorifying and turning these mass shooters into twisted anti-heroes by giving them a platform to espouse their ideas.  All mass shooters names and their amateur works should be scrubbed from the public.  Damnatio Memoriae is the only way to stop these  Columbine copy-cats.

Come on. The shooter was a former student from the school, so putting the bible back in schools didn't stop it. Teachers and staff at the school were armed. That didn't stop it.

When do we get to the logical conclusion that maybe we shouldn't let every person with a pulse own an AR15?"
Good point.  Biden makes Obama appear sympathetic and moderate.  Crazy to think I even said that.
"Exactly. We never had this level of shootings under Bush or Reagan. It was Obama's shitstirring in demeaning the institution of the police to appeal to his 'demographics' and general move to glorify the enemies of America that started this.

Remember, Obama's favorite pastor was Jeremiah Wright who said 9/11 was retribution for Americans taking indian land or something."

No where in anyone's statements does anyone say anything like ""oh good, it's Christian kids."" The only place that is coming from is people on the right ignoring what people on the left actually are saying, in order to sew division.

""Kids were killed by someone that shouldn't have had a gun."" That's what the left is saying.

You can complain about them wanting to take assault rifles off of the streets, and not let crazy people have guns in the first place, but you can't just pretend that they aren't calling this a tragedy."
Do you think there are really people who are glad Christians got killed? Have you heard anyone actually say that?

‚ÄúOnly 6 people died‚Äù
Right only 6 people who‚Äôs lives were irrelevant? Imagine for one second that you are a parent of one of those 3 kids who just got murdered AT SCHOOL. This was a targeted killing of a religious group. Minimizing this act as just another random shooting is pretty disgusting. Why is it not being called a hate crime like the others? The media televised candle lit vigils for those nightclub killings. Their headlines are supporting and encouraging more violence against anyone who doesn‚Äôt follow the trans agenda.
">Guys, lets be real. Only six people died. 

How callus can one be?

"Wait, are you being serious or are you sarcastically mimicking the fascist approach of some of todays left?  

The statement you made in italics rationalizes taking human rights away from a group of people (conservatives in your case).  Like many on the left, you are dehumanizing conservative to make it easier to sleep at night to cover the hate speech.

Days of ‚Äúvengeance‚Äù (one of which was scheduled to occur the Saturday after the murderer opened fire on innocent children and adults alike)
are classic examples to try and rile up your supporters to encourage  violence against those you hate.  The fact that the administration didn‚Äôt openly and aggressively fight this idea in the press is continued proof of their compliance with hate mongers to get votes.

The current day targeting of White Christian Conservatives focuses on race, religion, and political beliefs.   The fact that this group sometimes holds wealth or power is not unlike the complaints of past fascists who made statements to the effect of ‚Äúthey (whatever group you hate) are the cause of your problems because they control everything‚Äù 

Our unique brand of Constitutional Republic is what prevented genocide from happening in the US within the last 120 years like they did in democratic Europe.  It‚Äôs why it‚Äôs amazing to me that the Democrats seem so hell bent on trying to delegitimize the very country and constitution that has been successful in this feat."
And you're literally shaking right now too?
"> conservatives are *literally killing transpeople* and *literally trying to erase them*

Please enlighten me as to when a North American conservative has killed a transgender person.

We‚Äôre not trying to erase trans people, we‚Äôre trying to teach them that there‚Äôs nothing wrong with the way they‚Äôre born and they don‚Äôt need to change their gender identity or mutilate their own genitals in order to have a sense of belonging in society."
"Since the shooting, The White House has spent more time claiming that the trans community is 'under attack' and have not mentioned the Christians who were actually murdered. Democrats, their activists, and new pundits have continuously claimed there were 7 victims. 7. They include the terrorist as a victim. And I'm sure you do too.

> ""I never thought when I started my public life that guns would be the number one killer of children in America,""

Well that's just blatantly false. No serious person actually believes that. The study they use to get that bullshit says it's the ""number one killer of adolescents"", which they then include 18 and 19 year olds who are gang members because they see 19 year old drug dealers as adolescents in order to get the results they want for the narrative they want to push. Conflating 19 year old MS13 members with 4 year olds in daycare is not a serious study. This is known. But then people like Joe Biden's writers just change ""adolescents"" to ""children"" and keep repeating the lie for low information voters, like yourself.

Take the rest of your disgusting bad faith arguments back to whitepeopletwitter where they will praise you for them."
I miss Obama lol
"You do realize that this is Obama‚Äôs 3rd term. Mashed Pea Brain isn‚Äôt in charge of anything more sophisticated than his own bowel movements‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs a sock puppet. No doubt he was an absolute pile of a human being when he was a functioning person‚Ä¶ but he‚Äôs nothing more than Obama‚Äôs place holder at this point. All the same nefarious plans, characters, and deeds are continuing from the previous 8 year term. And if they can get away with rigging it again‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll get another 4 years on top of this."
"It's why I was so mad during the 2020 election. Biden was always left of Obama (who was a radical in my opinion himself), yet the media managed to convince the general population he was a moderate. It was incredible gaslighting, but was only possible because Trump couldn't stop running his mouth. Had Americans spent any time paying attention to Biden and his record they would have known the toad was bad news."
We are weak enough at the moment that China could invade Taiwan and the best strategic action would be to let them.

"Oh they could even streamline it more than that‚Ä¶

Never underestimate the msm ability to fabricate a narrative to suit their desire."
"Lol. They think ""the libs"" are celebrating this or something. I don't get it....I don't understand where these people come up with these conclusions"
No one is making this up. We have eyes. Whenever a right wing person commits a shooting the narrative is about how everyone even vaguely sharing their ideology is at fault. When a crazy left wing person shoots up people the narrative is that it‚Äôs the right‚Äôs fault for pushing them to act.
You boy Biden or do you really have this hard of a time with reading comprehension?
"Lol so this is really about the trans agenda? Nothing more?

I don‚Äôt want to be conservative anymore if this is what it‚Äôs about. My parents raised me to believe ‚Äúconservative‚Äù meant something. They never mentioned sexuality."

"Why the shooter is dead. Does it alleviate the family victims of the pain they bear?  The left and the trans community already say the shooter is a victim, and they won‚Äôt change that stance no matter what is written"
I've been calling for this for decades now.  The media has been posting the high score to beat if you want your name and ideas to immortalized for too long.
"He is a heretic, he's a liar and loves to tell stories he makes up to make himself relevant to whoever he's speaking to.

We are a laughing stock of the world and he is happy with that because he's cemented his families fortune for long after he's gone."
I went back and added the r/sarcasm tag. I was ridiculing that mindset.
I guess I needed the sarcasm indicator. I was making fun of lefties saying that.
I was literally joking about that line of thinking.
Well now how am I supposed to know what I've said that's so hateful of it's removed completely...Oh will guess I'll just keep thinking and speaking the same way since nothing I've said here is hateful or promoting violence
"Ok, well lets take that and dig into it then.

First, sure. They included 19 year olds, in their study of causes of deaths internationally. Then they ranked it.

https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/issue-brief/child-and-teen-firearm-mortality-in-the-u-s-and-peer-countries/

The first thing that jumps out here, is using the same age brackets (because countries outside of the US often consider anyone under 20 to be an adolescent), we see that no other country has firearms in the top 3 causes of death. If you're using the same numbers, why are we worse than everyone else?

The rest of my arguments are still sound. 

Following every previous school shooting in the last few years, Republican members of congress have called for both a ""return of god to the classroom"" and for teachers and staff to be armed. The comments that appear on this sub generally just say that these shootings only happen in gun free zones.

This was not a gun free zone. The staff was armed. The school was a Christian school, that the shooter had actually attended. 

The Republicans in congress said ""this would not happen"" if the teachers were armed, or god was in the classroom. This still happened. 

When can we be grown ups about this, and acknowledge that some people shouldn't have guns? 

Like, what about pedophiles? Should they be allowed to carry guns? Furries? Homeless people screaming ""I am God"" on the sidewalk? Unmedicated bipolar schizophrenics? 90 year old war vets with dimentia? We won't let them drive, but should we let them keep an AR15 in the nursing home?

That is the conversation that the rest of us are trying to have, because we already knew that bibles and armed lunch ladies don't stop school shootings.

If you don't want liberal kids or conservative kids shot in their classrooms, then you need to support changes that can actually make a difference. Because none of those armed teachers did shit."
"yep, Obama openly stated that he wouldn‚Äôt mind controlling things from a basement.

"Not even close.  He talked about ice cream, made jokes, blaming conservatives for the shooting, and refuses to call it a hate crime.

Go ahead and compare this response to other responses to these sort of events."
You really latched onto the last two words of that comment and ignored everything else. What a strange way to have a conversation.
"Yeah actually you are right it‚Äôs about much more than just the trans agenda. It‚Äôs about securing votes. It‚Äôs about controlling the narrative through victimization. It‚Äôs about pointing fingers at so called ‚Äúwhite supremacy‚Äù instead of the clear violent intentions occurring on the left. It‚Äôs about them supporting the indoctrination of minors. It‚Äôs about ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù that includes everyone but Christian‚Äôs and conservatives. The same conservatives that are the only ones willing to protect children from these very mentally unstable individuals. If you personally feel like putting on a dress and are a male, then have at it. Dance around in the mirror. No one is stopping you. Just don‚Äôt pick up a makeshift copy of Cinderella and try to teach other kids about some wacko non factual gender identity bullshit."
"And to hear the things the left says about Eric and Jr. - You‚Äôd think they‚Äôre talking about Hunter. It‚Äôs unbelievable, how ignorant and misled the non-radical Democrats are! I speak from firsthand experience, as my mother and a former close friend believe the Fake News. 
I‚Äôve begged them to spend a few minutes to look into the facts provided by alternative views, to the mainstream, and they flat out refuse."
They already won over the crowd. The crowd has gone satantic  since Obama and there is no going back
There‚Äôs lots of people that believe that nonsense. Full disclosure might help to open a few eyes for normal people.
"We need to be able to recognize the type of rhetoric that leads to this. I'm betting dollars to donuts that the ""trans genocide"" rhetoric is all over this shooting."
Yup. Instant notoriety if you murder kids nowadays. It‚Äôs a mess.
"Let's not forget that our president, the leader of the free world, is so friggin' weak that, not only would he *not* go if he weren't so feeble, but that he's not allowed to go because his brain is pudding at this point. 

He's not just a heretic; he's a blasphemer as well."
Pro tip:  Don't try to use sarcasm saying the exact things that leftist trolls roll in here and say.
"> Like, what about pedophiles? Should they be allowed to carry guns

Ok stop. Can't read anymore. No. They should be in jail for life for being pedophiles. Or, if I had my way, on death row for being pedophiles.

The fact that you even say such nonsensical stuff, and actually think you're winning the argument, makes me think you aren't a real person and thus not worth the time to take seriously."

There‚Äôs people on the fringe right that would use this to justify attacking trans people. Then the left can come in just like they did on the J6 incident and justify the shit they do."
"And what happens when an idiotic right winger uses that manifesto as an excuse to attack trans people?  The wheel goes round and round. Unless there‚Äôs a broad change in FBI/CIA/ whatever 3 letter agency that‚Äôs involved in this, they will never hold the left to the same accountability as the right has.

"I think they don't care because a lot of the people were saying they were switching to Coors...but isn't coors also under the same parent company that bud, blue moon, and even Corona is under? Like when ppl were mad at Fanta and were gonna switch to Sunkist...like it's all the same company"
"It used to be, But in clown world there's no more satire."
Remember the slippery slope.
When has that ever happened? This won't hit their sales at all.
"Left wing corporations, a very real thing that definitely exists. Sorry to inform you but there are no left wing corporations, these large companies are doing this whole ‚Äúwoke‚Äù thing because they are trying to make money by catering to a certain demographic. They want to make a profit, which is the primary goal of any corporation, making it impossible for them to be left wingers since they are participating in the capitalist mode of production. This is just capitalism, and if you have a problem with that you might just be a left winger and not realize it."
Coors and Budweiser are owned by different corporations. Basically two major companies own all the non microbrew beers.
"Leftists don't care about all the controversy when they push woke ideals on products. They're in it to push their agenda, Not to make cash.

Get woke, GO broke."
"all the time? there are exceptions to the rule, but generally pandering to people who don't even buy your product to begin with is not a great marketing strategy."

"are you dull? corporations are entities that can indeed have ideological motives. yes it is primarily for profit-making, but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that the corporation has a position on any political topic."
"Oh I thought Coors was half owned by SAB which is owned by A-InBev (which owns budweiser)

Edit: nevermind. I see SAB sold its stake in millers when it got bought by InBev"
"This. Odds are those who push this depraved agenda have no stake whatsoever in the business. After they destroy one business, they simply move onto the next business to do exactly the same thing."
"So no examples, just a vague ""all the time""? Not very convincing there."
"Something being bad from the start doesn't indicate that the ""wokeness"" is what caused it. It could very easily have just been a bad movie for a ton of reasons. You'd have to show that something that was successful fell off once they started being ""woke""."
"This won't destroy Bud, it won't make even a small impact on their sales. But keep acting like a victim. Do you really think a multi billion dollar corporation would mindlessly push forward an ad campaign? That they would do no market analysis to see the impacts of a marketing campaign? Wild claim."
"oh so i'm supposed to do research for you now? you can't think of a single film, tv show or product that decided to pander instead of make a good product and it didn't work out for them? here's a recent example: the animated series Velma. critically and commercially panned."
"Isn't your claim contradicted by the woke box-office bombs like Bros, Lightyear, and Strange Worlds?  Or lefty late night TV shows that are beaten by Gutfeld on Fox News?  Gillette lost a lot of customers, including me, after putting out a misandrist ad.  Maybe these people are stupider than you think they are?  
  
And frankly none of those were as tone-deaf and woman-hating as this Budweiser stunt."
"A bad show doesn't prove your point. Something that was bad and hated from the start means nothing. You claim that when a company goes woke, they lose everything. Something starting bad does not indicate that the woke made it bad."
"Or maybe those movies just sucked, and late night tv has been dying for decades. Correlation does not equal causation."
"He pulled it because they didn‚Äôt pay for verification, which is completely justified from both sides. Misleading headline. No one dunked on anyone here."
Title is 80% true click bait. He called them propaganda but they only lost the blue check because they didn't pay and they are now required to pay to keep it
"Misleading. Elon didn't pull New York Times' checkmark. He ended legacy checkmarks for everyone, and NYT didn't pay for the verification."
So glad to hear that NY Times isn't a verified source anymore.
It's about time the media gets called out as being the propaganda arm of the democratic party instead of news bravo
"So. NYT didn't pay for Twitter blue, so he removed the checkmark? Is that really news?

Also, the pricing of Twitter blue seems a bit like Lucille Bluth in arrested development saying ""It's one banana Michael, how much could it cost? Ten dollars?""

Musk is funny. But he really is going to drive that company to the ground. Good riddance though."
Imagine thinking the NY Times was a valid source to begin with. Lol
"Wait, what does the southern poverty law center say about this???"
Lol fucking awesome!
"It *is* propaganda, and it makes you pay money to read it!  The least they could do is chalk up the 7 bucks a month to give that rag a veneer of legitimacy."
"This might mark the beginning of the end for Twitter. Twitter requires a broad selection of content to stay relevant and we're about to find out if Twitter can afford to lose so many content generators.


Anecdotally, I work for a few companies that felt Twitter has gone downhill. They feel it's not worth the monthly price and will be focusing on other platforms instead.


It will be interesting to see how that plays out."
It‚Äôs because they refused to pay.
"Misleading title. NYT decided to not pay for the badge.

If Musk really started curating badges on his own whim, he'd be just on the same level as the twitter management before."
Ok. NYT didn't pay for the blue check mark. They can do what they want. This really doesn't affect my life in any meaningful way.
I mean they ARE just propaganda at this point
"You know, I'm gonna be honest, the way Elon is handling twitter is abysmal. Just as I don't want twitter to be the arbiter of truth, I don't want Twitter to be the arbiter of what is false either. Let the free press exist. We shouldn't be for censorship or delegitimization just because we disagree with someone. 

^(Besides that though, some of the backend stuff Elon is doing is stupid too. He acts as if paying for twitter blue is somehow gonna weed out the bots on the platform, and uses it as a pretense to take verifications away from legitimate people. Like yeah I know there are a bunch of people who didn't need to be verified, but is it really that hard to just leave their verification or at least make a different type of verification? Make verified identities a dark blue and twitter blue a light blue or something. They're things that if you pitched them to me I'd be able to tell you is a dumb idea. He's barely done anything right honestly. Twitter was always a good product, its just the users are stupid.)"
Too little; too late.
This is not at all what happened. They pulled verified for everyone who isn‚Äôt paying.
A whole news article about not paying an 8 dollar subscription.
"The people too cheap to pay for verification are also the ones harping about everyone paying their ""fair share"" in taxes."
"Uh, isn't this against the concept of free speech?"
"It just shows you how much more they are interested in propaganda then money.

Their entire reason for being on Twitter is to get people to click on their articles and not be able to read them without paying up. This is a horrible business decision for them."
"The New York Times has been lying for the last 100 years. They lied about Cuba, the Vietnam war, the holocaust, on and on."
NYT is straight trash
"Wow, Musk is taking on a dragon.  The New York Times is the Left‚Äôs ‚ÄúPravda.‚Äù"
Even though the Liberals claim that they don't do Twitter anymore I know this drives them nuts
Where's the lie?
"Tbf he did announce that as of April 1, they would begin the process of phasing out all the existing legacy checkmarks so that eventually only Twitter Blue users will have blue checkmarks.

I go on Twitter regularly and I love this change. For anyone who doesn‚Äôt go on Twitter, there are now four different verified checkmarks:

1. Blue check: Anyone who pays for Twitter Blue AND passes the verification process will get a blue check. Contrary to popular opinion, it‚Äôs not enough to just buy a Twitter Blue subscription. You actually do need to pass a verification process and this can take up to 2 weeks if it‚Äôs your first time getting verified.

2. Legacy blue check: Visually the same as the blue check but they‚Äôre essentially leftovers from the old verification system that was specifically catered to promoting and honoring celebrities. These legacy checks are currently in the process of being removed from Twitter.

3. Gold check: You can register a business/company with Twitter and get a special business account that has a square-shaped PFP and a gold check. This is to establish that any tweets made by a gold check are representative of the company that‚Äôs attached to the account.

4. Gray check: Basically the same thing as the gold check but it‚Äôs for government organizations/officials. Similar to the gold check, it exists to establish that any tweets made by a gray check are representative of the government office or institution attached to the account."
"remember before Musk people mocked checkmarks anyway? they're just more of a joke now than they were before, yet the left makes such a big fucking deal about it because Musk lives rent free in their heads."
It was always propaganda.
"NYT corporation wants you to pay $25 per month to see their BIASED stories, but at the same time is too cheap to pay $7 per month for that blue checkmark"
And so it begins.
I love this man
"Finally.

NYT needs to work on its credibility."
10/10 for nailing the landing
"Well, they did say they would not pay for it. Sounds like Elon is being petty for petty's sake."
"Elon has been a weirdo lately, but this redeems him. Very cool to just shit on them like that lol a lot of the stuff they write definitely sounds bias and written by an amateur."
"Meh, the only thing the ""verified check mark"" verifies anymore is that the account paid for the check mark."
Any organization that lied to us during COVID was enemy propaganda.
Because it is.
"I mean, he's not wrong lol. It's one of my dad's staple sources of 'news' and the shit he espoused during the pandemic that he ""read in the Times"" was disturbing as shit. They had him convinced essentially that nothing short of totalitarianism was really the only way to tackle COVID."
CNN should be today then?
Hahahaha
Good.
Its about time.
Next do the CBC please
So the New York Times picks on kids for the way they were brought up. That's how scumbags defend themselves.
"I don't like where this is going



EDIT: And I retract my concern as I shamelessly only read the headlines"
Can I like this post twice!
Thinking the same thing. There is no reliable us news networks - I get my news from the BBC - can‚Äôt take it.
LOL love that
He isn't wrong.
Happy cake day!
How is it misleading?  Other news organizations have not paid but have retained their verified status.
All it takes to be a verified account on Twitter is to pay $7.99 a month. Or is that not a thing anymore?
"They never truly were, just a bunch of clowns gave them a check and said they were respectable"
"> NY Times isn't a verified source anymore.

As it stands I‚Äôm more apt to believe the National Enquirer‚Ä¶Bat Boy has never done me wrong."
It's straight up foreign interference in elections.
"Liberals understand the power of language and that simply stating things over and over again, gives it even more power. Conservatives need to take this back and use it against them.

‚Äúoh you must have heard that watching MSNBC‚Äù 

‚ÄúNY times isn‚Äôt a verified source.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease stop spreading misinformation about President Trump, that‚Äôs dangerous to democracy.‚Äù"
Something's misleading about the title though... Are they actually getting called out or did they just let it lapse?
"Honestly, I'm at the point where I don't think there are any valid sources of news. And it makes me feel like that's exactly where they want us. 

Everything is fact checked and everything is disproven... Our little bubbles point to us and say look, We have the common sense and we know what's good. But everyone's doing that... We are not unique in our little bubbles. Anyone who tries to tell me to get mad at something.... I immediately don't trust them.  Who's remains at this point?"
"As Andrew Klavan says, *a former newspaper*. Lol."
can you believe they were actually respected in the 80s
‚ÄúThis is it: the End of Democracy‚Äù
"Forget them, what does Ja Rule think?"
"A red question mark put on NYT's twitter or similar would be more appropriate I think.

It would denote enemy action.  ""Trust at your own risk."""
it's $1000 a month for companies.
It's just 'entertainment' if you have to pay.
"It's $1,000 a month for organizations."
"LOL we've been hearing that Twitter is about to collapse ever since Musk took over. Still there.

Anyway, the headline is misleading. The NYT let their blue checkmark lapse, he didn't take it."
Then Project Fear will have to find a new space to metastasize in its next incarnation.
So losing a blue check mark removes their content?
I worked with ad tracking for a company around 2020 and even then pintrist was driving more sales than twitter ads.
"Putting all politics aside, twitter has always felt like an absolute graveyard for ad sales - I can‚Äôt think of a single sponsored post that I didn‚Äôt either subconsciously ignore or recognize, spend a split second grumbling mentally about, and scroll past. 

Compare that to instagram - ‚Äúooh, another pair of nylon workout shorts WITH a phone pocket in the liner??‚Äù 

Twitter is a text based medium, I don‚Äôt think it really lends itself to sponsored content. 

Also, whenever I read up on twitter drama I have to remind myself that it‚Äôs the social media equivalent of the school paper in terms of user count. So much of this drama is really just infighting"
"The thing is, companies wont stop posting on twitter, its too good for reaching their audience. Unless some even more heinous decisions get made along the way

What is actually happening is that noone wants to advertise on twitter anymore. Advertising is what drives income for all social media companies, and twitter wasnt profitable before musk bought it and drove away a significant part of their advertisers. Twitter wont fail as long as its owned by musk, but it also will continue to loose money until he either sells it, pulls the plug or somehow miraculously manages to right the ship, which isnt looking good at this point"
All the content of NYT is locked behind a paywall. They do not produce anything usefull for the Twitter user.
"Lmao, ‚Äúother platforms‚Äù. Facebook is dead man walking, TikTok on the verge of being banned. Instagram? Yeah ok‚Ä¶ Reddit is a dumpster fire of censorship and adolescence. Twitter is *the* platform unless you‚Äôre hopelessly woke."
But what if they lose some content but gain others. And eventually they have all kinds of news. Not just fucking fake ass democrat news but also real news from real sources. Imagine a world where people see two sides of the stories and stop getting brain washed blue.
THE WALLS ARE CLOSING IN

"1 - Who's the state actor? 

2 - What speech is being curtailed?"
"Read the article. I get the title makes it sound like Musk calling NYT propaganda and them loosing their verified status are connected. And that would be antithetical to free speech. But that's not what happened. 

They lost it because they chose not to pay for Twitter Blue. And Musk made an offhand tweet in the aftermath, referring to their stories as propaganda."
They didn‚Äôt chose to pay for the verification. They aren‚Äôt free anymore. A business or celebrity surely has enough money to keep their verified status.
What do you mean ‚Äúwhere this is going?‚Äù  The media broke the seal on ‚Äúdeplatforming‚Äù years ago - the only difference is that they are now getting a taste of their own medicine.
"Like all leftist-infested once-prestigious institutions, they live in houses they did not build built by greater men who would be disgusted at what their creations have now become."

I think it can afford that too.
link for that amount?
"To be fair, Musk stated that Twitter is currently worth half of what he paid for it. ""Still there"" might be too low a bar to dismiss the naysayers."
People like Colbert were announcing its failure so quickly without much in depth info.  People need it to fail and hope it will fail.  It's telling.
"You seem angry about this. When I'm feeling too invested I try to remember that these companies don't care about us aside from extracting money.

As for the culture war, I'm not American so I won't weigh in on that. It's my time for bed. Have a good night!"
This is censorship though. I don't like that.
They might not have enough money.  They are called the failing New York Times after all.
"Im not even sure where the news could even ""be going"" which would be worse than what we have now."
Sounds like Reddit.

"I never cared about Twitter in the first place, so I won't shed any tears if it goes under."
"TBF, this is how Elon operates.  He's not some typical corporate raider, he sinks ungodly amounts of money into things he believes in and doesn't care what experts and the market believe will happen.  Then he has a decent track record of turning them into home runs."
It doesn‚Äôt matter what a company is worth unless you‚Äôre planning on selling it. What matters is cash flow which they have. If he holds on to twitter indefinitely he will make his money back and more.
"The reason twitter is worth half of what Musk payed for it (I will take your word for it) is fraud. A good portion of their accounts were bots. So twitter got a good portion of their ad revenue from Advertisers thinking they reached real people  that may become paying customers when in fact they only reached bots. 

In the long run honesty and truth is the best business policy as the NYT will soon find out."
What's being censored?
"These days I don't have an opinion, but there was a time when Twitter was the only way to directly communicate with utilities during an emergency where I'm from."
"While I love your optimism, I don't know what I can do with you're personal feelings that Twitter, over an indefinite period of time, might be worth more than it was last year.

What I DO know is what Musk himself said about the here and now which doesn't line up with your sunshine and rainbows.

Also, if you think cash flow is what matters, you should scrutinise your numbers again because it doesn't look like there's a lot left after the large debt payments."
Who cares? Twitter is one of the worst things ever invented. If it disappears humanity will benefit.
This has since changed.  There are no longer charges being filed.
"Democrats want you unarmed, banned from protecting yourself, and to have no police.  
Because  Democrats are the party of hate and misery."
Someone please explain to me why anyone votes Democrat.
This is like the third story I‚Äôve seen like this. Self defense isn‚Äôt murder
"I mean, he was shot twice and then fought for his life... what do they want him to do? Reminds me of South Africa where gun laws sometimes wouldn't protect you if you shot an armed home invader."
Honestly kinda scared that I live in canada. Pretty sure if myself or my family were ever in serious danger I would end up in jail protecting myself. My girlfriend and I talked about it. The laws are pretty sketchy. You must be certain there is no other option to defend yourself before you can use lethal force. Seems like it would fall through easily knowing canada
"[Exactly, police initially charged Diarra but after reviewing the case Bragg's office dropped the charges.] (https://www.google.com/amp/s/nypost.com/2023/04/02/bragg-wont-charge-wounded-garage-worker-who-shot-suspected-thief/amp/)"
It's such an **obvious** case of **self defense** that no jury will ever convict him.
">no longer charges being filed.

The fact that they were in the first place is a clear indicator that something is seriously wrong."
"police...  the ones they want to defund, btw.

just a cleanup crew for the next dolt."
Brain dead and gullible
"I suspect they only dropped charges because they want the news to focus on Trump. Otherwise, Bragg would through the book at the guy. In Manhattan, only the good get punished."
"They want to defund the police **for you**.

Democrats themselves want lots of police protection **for themselves**."
If things continue at this rate then we'll have a VERY serious shortage of conspiracy theorists as existing theorists are proven right at an alarming rate.

"Yeah?! No s***! What did you guys think it was doing? Taking landscape photos for their desktop backgrounds?

I just‚Ä¶..HOW?! That f***** should have been shot down the second it crossed into U.S airspace. You don‚Äôt take chances when it comes to National Security. Oops, sorry NOAA. We shot down your hundred thousand dollar weather ballon? Too bad, should have made the proper paperwork. 

This is just another f***up courtesy of the Biden admin that threatens our National Security. Say what you will about Trump but I guarantee that he never would have allowed that ballon to fly over the continental U.S."

"China will move on Taiwan before joe leaves office.  They would be fools not to.  The man, and his administration,  are imbeciles"
"Take this time to consider an alternative perspective of the same argument.

If conspiracy theorists are consistently correct, that means that there is a conspiracy. Conspiracies alone are not that dangerous or problematic, it is the goals and means of achieving them which makes them a problem. Conspiracies tend to remain conspiracies because the goals ands means to achieve them are not seen favorably.

If the ""uninformed"" public is correct more often than trusted institutions with extremely large budgets dedicated to journalism *then journalism has fully become propaganda*.

Now for the worst of it all.

If both of these things are true then we have an immediate threat amongst us. We are heading down a path that will make America not America anymore, that is if we are not already there.

We MUST stand up to this."
Really can‚Äôt even blame China for taking advantage of this shit show. It‚Äôs fucking embarrassing what we consider pressing issues over here in the states
"Lol no we can‚Äôt.  It‚Äôs a great strategy for China to become the next world power. 

It‚Äôs our governments fault. They are corrupt."
The presidency always rotates among the security council. This is pointless complaining by people who have no idea what they're complaining about.
"Doesn't it just cycle around? So this was bound to happen.    

The UN is mostly just fugazi to keep the non nuclear powers of the world under the control of the nuclear powers while giving them a sense of agency on the world stage. The nuclear powers built the UN for their own benefit, not to be controlled by the UN.   

It is not as if the UN has any real authority over sovereign nations. If the UN told us to stop doing anything, we would laugh. 

So who gives a shit what happens at the UN?"
"if you find that government is good only when you or your team is in power, perhaps government isn't ever good."
"UN is a bad joke, dissolve it."
"My question remains, *why are they still on the Security Council at all?*  They invaded a sovereign nation without any credible cause.  They have committed war crimes.  This is exactly what the UN was founded to prevent."
When I saw people posting this the other day I thought it was an April fool's joke but now I see it's the UN that's a  joke.
"This Wachtel guy is just a journalist and diplomatic comms guy. What he thinks is likely quite irrelevant. Koffler is right about this possibly helping Russian propaganda somewhat. I anticipate the session Lavrov will be chairing will get lots of airtime in Russia, China, and on the airwaves and cables of other disreputable regimes."
"The UN has been a joke since it‚Äôs inception. How about just dissolve it, found a new one for only 3rd world counties, and make the super powers only have the same authority as the 3rd world members, this way they can actually have a damn vote, also no super power funds it at all"
"The UN served a purpose when, in the postwar milieu, it was a way to project 1950s American values worldwide with the appearance of international backing.

As soon as it became something other than a vehicle for that, it's a net negative for civilization and should be abolished."
"Hey! Look over here! President Trump slept with a hot chick almost ten years ago. Look. I'm strutting around and crowing like a king rooster jive turkey. J6, War balloon, Tic Tok, global warming....pay attention to me."
"Anyone saying we shouldn't involve ourselves in foreign wars in response to what is happening in Ukraine clearly doesn't understand geopolitics well enough to be a part of the conversation.

Russia is invading a sovereign nation. It's one thing to not involve ourselves in a country's internal politics and internal wars. It's another thing to standby and allow full on offensives into a completely different country. If Russia is willing to make excuses for why they should be allowed to take over Ukraine, does anyone truly believe it would stop there? At what point does the ""don't involve ourselves in eastern European conflicts"" stop? Does it stop after Ukraine? Yeah, right. If you'll turn a blind eye to Ukraine, then you'll also turn a blind eye to Germany, and France, and every other European nation. Next thing you know, ""eastern Europe"" just becomes ""Europe"".  If that isn't throwing off WWII vibes in your head, then I don't know what to tell you. If it is, then you understand why it's important to stop land grabs like what is going on in Ukraine."
If I didn't know better I'd swear the US was being................sanctioned.
"Wait, we give a shit about what the UN says/does? I thought we were just joking"
OMFG
"Agreed, but I will also take my place among the complainers to express my displeasure at how the US disproportionately funds the UN, and further, how the UN often operates contrary to US and western interests."
Will the council investigate the bombing of the Nordstream pipeline?
"The UN is mostly a tool to control the weaker nations of the world. We don't need to dissolve it, we just need to not fool ourselves into believing it has any authority over nuclear armed nations. Like it or not, USA, China, Russia, UK, and France can more or less do whatever we want."
"Because the whole point of the UN is to prevent major wars between large economies. 

Not to stop war, or bring any kind of justice."
"They are on the security council because they are the successor to a victor of WWII which put them on the council to begin with, and they still have a very large nuclear arsenal which keeps them on."
"Because to remove them from the Security Council would require the unanimous consent of all members of the Security Council.

Somehow, I don't think they'll vote for that."
China is still on the human rights council. It‚Äôs all a clown world show
"The UN was founded to prevent World War III. That's it. So far it's doing that no thanks to the leftists and those on the right that think Ukraine is worth armageddon. You sound like a lefty talking about Iraq and Afghanistan when you spout off about ""war crimes"" when what is happening is just plain old fuckin war."
Wouldn't those parameters revoke America's place on the council as well?  Or do those rules apply to everyone else and not the USA
"The UN Chater says nothing about preventing ""war crimes."" There is nothing in the UN Chater (Chapter V) about suspending a member--permanent or rotating--from the Security Council."
"Because if you kick out a nation for bombing another nation the US wouldn't be in it either.

If you kick out Russia they're isolated which can make them more dangerous because there's 'no path back.'

There's still a (albeit slim) possibility that Russia turns a 180 but it will take Putin being killed / tried for crimes + an absolutely massive repayment to Ukraine akin to Germany / Japan post WW2."
"This didn‚Äôt just start with an invasion.  It started in 2013 with the ousting of the pro-Russian president (heavily influenced by the west) and then a civil war started in the primarily Russian speaking areas to break away, this is where the war is still focused.  The war in Donbas started in 2014.  There‚Äôs also been a lot of passive aggressive stuff like building a dam to block water to chimera.

The west has been meddling in Ukraine for some time, and so has Russia.  It has fertile land and is the buffer between NATO and Moscow.

I feel bad for the men on each side, because it‚Äôs essentially a game of puppet master."
Literally all countries on the UN counsel fall under your same umbrella.
"So they did what the US does constantly and you have a double standard‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs fine, but they haven‚Äôt done anything beyond the pale. By US standards they are downright peaceful."
No. Vetos still in play from all other permanent council members

Nah. I think it's for delegates to dine in expensive New York City restaurants.

"Just look at the members of this committee that supposedly fight for ""freedom of association and assembly,[5] freedom of expression,[6] freedom of belief and religion,[7] women's rights,[8] LGBT rights,[9] and the rights of racial and ethnic minorities.[b]"" as taken from Wikipedia.

It's some lingering sense of patriotism I guess?"
"So 1962? And very limited. Sounds good to me. 

Seems like it's working."
"Yeah it's weird to see conservatives say things like ""we"" need to support Ukraine.  Haven't figured it out yet?  To the Biden regime and the globalists there is no ""we.""  They view us no differently than the Russians.

Who do you think they're going to target once they have achieved total world domination?  Us."

Theys
"Yeah, It's just an odd thing to put in a email."
This is the real reason. It's not a professional term in a work environment.
You‚Äôve never written a letter to address a multitude of people addressing them and ladies and gentlemen? /s
Why not? Because u didn‚Äôt want to offend anybody?
"That seems a touch aggressive, but when they don‚Äôt like ‚Äúladies‚Äù, maybe it‚Äôs time to get aggressive."
I'm fine with that.
"Well? That's an ablist concept. 

It's better to say, ""I hope this email finds you fully vaccinated, freely medicated, and your identities have been reaffirmed today."""
I used to say guys but then was told to use ladies when the audience was only females. This was in a tech services sales job.
So now it‚Äôs ok to misgender them?  Ugh.
"I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever said ladies unironically tbh lol. Though to be fair, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever spoken to solely a group of women where I felt ‚Äúladies‚Äù would even be useful. 

It‚Äôs all about context. Did this guy say ‚Äúladies‚Äù in a condescending tone or was it purely to specifically address the women he was talking to?"
"Yes, ladies and gentlemen is so unprofessional.üôÑ"
"If you happen to know that everyone you're addressing is a woman, I don't think I would describe it as unprofessional."
I have never said that in an email.
"He doesn't ""think"" he has."
"I havent because it sounds ridiculous. 

If I email a group of females, I still will say ""Hey,"" or ""Guys,"" so I dont think its offensive."
There is nothing wrong with you and the 14 psychoactive prescriptions you take to null the fucked up situation you have got yourself in.
"Guys doesn't bother me. Ladies doesn't bother me. I wish they would just pick a gosh darn lane or stop being so damn sensitive!

Ladies actually does sound more professional though...I just don't see the issue."
"It was just a header in an email where he was trying to negotiate his contract. It's hard to tell the context though since the email isn't in the article. 

Honestly this is a giant power trip by those women though, pulling an offer that was about to be finalized because of how he addressed them. Sounds like they disliked him and just needed a reason to get the other voters on board to eject him"
They didn't say ladies and gentlemen.
"I wouldn't say it's unprofessional but more of in between, in that etiquette area where 99% of the time it's ok but the wrong audience can get you in trouble. It's always best to remove gender from a business email."
Guys is worse than ladies!
"

>I havent because it sounds ridiculous. 

>If I email a group of females, I still will say ""Hey,"" or ""Guys,"" so I dont think its offensive.

That doesn't sound too professional."
"Yeah ladies is the female version of gentleman. ""Ladies and gentleman"". Its literally being t'd off about being referred to respectfully."
">They didn't say ladies and gentlemen.

What's the difference if its said together? If he or I called just the men, gentlemen. Is that ""unprofessional""?"
"Sure it's safer these days to air on that side of caution, but the general sentiment is there shouldn't be anything wrong with addressing a group of women as ""ladies"". And it sure as he'll shouldn't be grounds for rescinding an employment offer. ""Lady"" is traditionally a very respectful way to address a woman."
"It could be, depending on the audience and the business you are in. You can get away with a ""hey fellas"" email greeting at a small company but I don't think that will fly at large corporations or educational departments like this case."
"So, as for calling the men gentlemen... you ""don't think that will fly at large corporations or educational departments like this case.""

Yeah, sure whatever, guy. I don't care what you ""think.""

Gentlemen is a professional term.

Good day, sir."
You think gentlemen is a professional term? Or do you just like your men to be tender?
"I still don't understand why anarchy = communism in the eyes of the anarachists. Communism is like the least anarachic thing i can think of. ""its okay to break the law until the communist regime takes over that decides everything for you""."

"When trying to overthrow a government, they always go after the educated first. They need their followers dumb. They also don't like feeling dumb by someone smarter than them."
This article is just dead wrong.  It's not academia's fault that a *particular demographic in urban cities* rob and murder each other.  The fact that demographics exist and that they are distinct and different from each other is enough to observe the disparity.
This article is some 1950‚Äôs Red Scare shit
"All elite universities should have their endowments confiscated, their buildings razed, and the earth underneath salted. They are anathema to a civilized society and are turning out generations of spoiled garbage baby communists."
Lots of problems with higher education but listing crime as one is laughable. Do better
It‚Äôs because they‚Äôre brainwashed and think both anarchy and communism are counter culture to americas ‚Äúfascism‚Äù. They also believe under communism everything is free and they can just sit around painting pictures or something.
Yes it‚Äôs a very incoherent philosophy by entitled angry children
"The thinking goes that with no state, society organizes into collective units. Like idk... communes or something. It's not an unfair jump except whoever is the vanguard party of the communists of the nation going through it ends up creating a totalitarian state to enforce its hold on power."
Yes communism is bad
"So in the 1950's when the USSR was at it's very height, there was no attempt to undermine the United States, but today, Russia...Russia..Russia. Mkay. Commies were up to shit back then too. They're literally using the same play book."
What a garbage take
Imprison the staff too
Yeah. The end goal is effectively a stateless society where everyone works for the betterment of everyone. Which is a laughable fantasy because the massive state formed as the prerequisite to setting the ground for the end goal will NEVER give up that power.
So basically just small governments. Wow kind of funny considering many republicans want stronger state governments. They seriously are voting for the wrong side if they want deregulation and less centralized power.
You‚Äôre overreacting to a minuscule issue that happens at universities. 19 year olds have been making rash wild choices since the start of time. You‚Äôre just suckered into thinking that universities secondary objective is creating communists. Even though there aren‚Äôt many entities who pull in more PROFIT than colleges
And the red scare was a terrible way to deal with Russia back then
"It's just his 5 minutes of hate. The liberals aren't going anywhere, they're half the country."
"No. Not governments. You have the ability (in this theoretical society) for complete freedom of association, there's no force compelling your submission to its rules if you don't freely agree to join.
There's still order and justice, it's just private order and private justice."
And I don't think most Republicans are anarchists so idk what you mean?
Yes they‚Äôve gamed the system of government spending (paid for by taxpayers) to bloat their administrative staff and lure students into huge loans while promoting a failed ideology
McCarthy was right
"IDK, I was told that it was terrible the way they vilified McCarthy by people who actually lived during the time and also attended universities in NYC that were promoting communism. Columbia to be exact."
Thank God its only half.  The left has owned the education system and the government spoon for generations. I just remember how hardcore the indoctrination was back in college back in the early 2000's. You couldn't pay me to take classes now.
"Idk i took a political philosophy course in college as an elective and they were talking about how governments are basically the result of how shitty the state of nature is (which is basically anarchy). If you put people in a state of nature (no state) then they become tribes. The tribes are basically just mini governments/tiny countries, with their own rules. Problem is larger tribes go around taking the smaller tribes shit. So the tribes end up going into fuedal times. One of the big dogs essentially instead of stealing takes taxes from the small dogs in exchange for protection. In essence that is what a government is. Anarchists seem to be saying they will go back to a tribal state, problem is in my mind the tribal state is just making smaller governments."
I was with you until you got to the ideology part. When was the last time you had a semester in college?
About what?
Don't worry I'm not going to
"The counter i'd suppose (I'm not an anarchist) is that if you're free to join one (or more) of the new tribes you'd still be more free than you are now. No native born American had any choice in becoming American, and these new mini nations/ gangs/ communes/corporations/ whatever will inherently be weaker and less able to oppress than our current authoritarian republic"
I was a stem major
"In college right now. Big Ten school, Aerospace engineering major. Last Marxist ideologies I heard in class was during philosophy 101 two semesters ago, but I'm not in any humanities courses this semester so that's why.

I've actually got some books on Marxism I took from a ""Free Books"" shelf in the sociology department. Shelf was always full of that sort of stuff; it was books the professors didn't want anymore, so they were giving them away to students. Haven't finished them yet, but they seem pretty pro-Marxism from what I've read so far."
"Yeah where as id say what it really does is let groups that come together with less morals to take advantage of the others since there is no rule of law saying so. The gangs will just end up at war and the cycle will start over until a government large enough to stick up for rules takes hold. 

I know i one day went to the anarchy sub, its wild and misguided for sure"
When was the last time you had a semester in college
"No surprise a philosophy 101 class was left of the spectrum. I had a sociology class like that a couple years back. 

Honestly if someone gets turned radical one direction or another from a single class then they‚Äôre just gullible. People out of college seem to think there are Bernie sanders conversations in my anatomy 101 class lol"
3 years ago and this crap is there there were coddling booths erected when trump won ect it was not in stem yet but it tinted every other class
What college?
TIL offering emotional and mental health opportunities for people is communism.
no it is a clear political bias in ab institution that should work to minimize its bias
"It also depends heavily on the institution. Colleges in general are going to lean very left. You have other colleges which tend to lean very right, usually in connection with faith IE liberty college. At many institutions most of these resources are already there, they just get amplified, used, and talked about significantly more during times of stress like finals or elections."

Candidates from both parties are always groomed and unfairly ushered into the voting booths from behind the scenes. Trump broke that in 2016 because he simply received too many votes, they couldn't shove in Jeb or Ted. That's why they were so hamfisted with the 2020 election fraud."

Do we really think the lack of prosecution of Hillary had ANYTHING to do with a supposed (and unprecedented) show of restraint by Trump of all people?
I am honestly shocked there isn‚Äôt more of you celebrating considering all the Trump hate here.
When the democrats arrest Trump. They are setting the stage for Ron Desantis to arrest Biden in two years
Maybe stop taking the moral high ground.
Lock her up
"The two investigations were night and day different.  In Hillary, they handed out immunities like it was candy in a dog and pony show to hamper any possible indictment.  With Trump, it was a ""show me the man and I'll find you the crime"" type investigation designed to railroad him into a biased court."
"There are no more moderates left in power on the Left, just the extremists and those who don't care what they have to say, as long as they remain in power."
It was such a huge mistake on trump‚Äôs part to not go after her when he could have.
"She ran an illegal email server against the most basic rules of classified info. 

As fucking secretary of state.

She should have absolutely disappeared into a federal pen for a decade or more."
Well the President does appoint the head of Department of Justice and Attorney General.
"Well the Trump hate is because he obviously cannot win the general election.  Whether thats right or wrong, I don't know that anyone cares.  The disgust with DJT goes beyond that.  

The problem is that the left knows what they are doing.  They are elevating DJT so he can easily be defeated in the general election.  Sure... if DJT gets the nomination I will support him, like most here, but we just don't want it to come to that."
You actually believe that?
"Are they though? Biden himself hasn‚Äôt done anything that would be considered illegal. Has he done something Unethical, morally wrong, or otherwise in bad taste 1000% all politicians have. But it‚Äôs hard for someone to find politician that have blatantly violated a US code, law or statute. Most of the time it‚Äôs stuff that is simply unethical.

For instance there is nothing in federal law saying a president cannot lie to the press or people. There is nothing illegal about putting a family member in a position of trust in the government. He could write a pardon for his Son murdering a federal law enforcement officer on federal property and it would not be illegal.

Only illegal thing presidents get involved in is lying to congress which is perjury. 

There are executive level regulations or orders about it, but those orders and regulations were created by the executive branch. According to the courts they can apparently be removed or ignored by the executive branch. 

Trump exposed himself to a lot of legal action simply because he never cared to look before he jumped. Honestly I think the NY will be won y Trump especially compared to the Georgia case. because It does seem pretty clear that he attempted to influence an election official there for his own benefit."
"They don‚Äôt care about Biden - they just care about power and destroying their opponents. What they‚Äôve already done to Trump as a political outsider is the point, ‚Äúif you come to Washington you‚Äôre life will be ruined forever‚Äù"
Biden isn‚Äôt mentally fit to stand trial
"The bigger fish is Obama. Biden is a throw away.

Obama can be arrested for his illegal assassination of an American without due process. Or his illegal foreign campaign contribution from Putin via election help during 2012."
"That‚Äôs if Desantis can win though. My prediction is Biden runs again with a new VP, and if he wins, he‚Äôs ‚Äúdiagnosed‚Äù with some form of dementia and declared unfit for office shortly after."
"Why wait? Hunter doesn‚Äôt have the same protections as his father. If there is incriminating evidence against him, do it now"
"Doubt it. I reckon Biden will be deemed unfit to stand trial after his presidency. 

He‚Äôs very clearly not all there."
Propaganda 24 hours a day has its' toll ...
Are you arguing the merits of the Hillary prosecution that never happened?
"I‚Äôm not the op but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if a Republican DA went after Biden and his family or Clinton. 

Seeing Trump actually get indicted shifted my opinion on this issue. I thought he was being played and there was no way the Dems would be this insane. Now I‚Äôm sick of us playing nice, we have to hit back twice as hard across the board and I‚Äôd wager I‚Äôm not alone in that feeling.

Idk why/how he thinks DeSantis would do anything as president though since that‚Äôs not his job."
"> Are they though? Biden himself hasn‚Äôt done anything that would be considered illegal.

You're missing the point. I'm sure there's some obscure state or federal felony he has committed. Give GOP prosecutors enough time and they can whip something up.

This is the danger of what Democrats are doing to Trump- their desire to get him at all costs is going to force the GOP to retaliate. While the GOP doesn't have control over DC nor Delaware where they have the easiest time prosecuting Democrats, there are certainly a lot of Democratic congresscritters in red states that would be on the receiving end of lawfare."
This is exactly right.  The message here is ‚Äúthis is what is going to happen to you if you interfere with our power.‚Äù  At first they targeted those who worked for Trump.
He is a disposable sock puppet.  You don't really think he is in charge do you?
"We don't have to argue the merits, there's no question about what she did. Comey admitted it. The question is why wasn't she tried for it."
"I'm saying in a just world it'd be a slam dunk. She knowingly used it even if there aren't records showing her demanding jt to be setup. 

She, her aides that helped and her IT hires should all be rotting right now. And they aren't."
That‚Äôs just it. There‚Äôs no such thing as an obscure federal felony. That is the same reason Trump and Biden get an a pass for miss handling classified information it‚Äôs executive regulation in the US code defines It has been under the presidents purview.
"> There‚Äôs no such thing as an obscure federal felony.

Actually, there is. I suggest you read up on [Three Felonies A Day](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6611240-three-felonies-a-day), which is the average number of federal felonies every American commits per day. The laws are obscure because there's an ever-increasing number of interwoven laws, regulations, and administrative opinions across the United States at the Federal and State level, plus all of the international law that we've incorporated into them."

"Oh, hey, it‚Äôs the man who pushed neoliberalism on the world. How‚Äôs that going?"
That‚Äôs what the constitution says I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs even up for debate
How many non US citizens voted in the 2022 election in Texas?
"Jesus. 

The fact that this is something that even needs clarification is terrifying."
"No need, it's in the constitution."
Seems like this should have already been a law! Pretty obvious.
"The DC City Council decided to allow non citizen residents to vote in local elections, which got overturned by the House. The Texas senate is now making a bit of political theater out of it so they can tell their constituents they are ""ensuring election integrity""."
I don't think the constitution says anything about local elections?
"I don't think it is a debate, just some politicians trying to avoid addressing real issues."
One is too damned many. The fact something as basic as this needs to be codified into law says a lot about how things are going.
But noncitizens are voting in blue states which is one of the reasons that keep California from flipping red.
"DC shouldn't even BE a city, they need to gut it and give the extra territory to the surrounding states.

no mayor, no schools, nothing."
Ahh that makes sense. So if they let someone vote in a national election that wasn‚Äôt a citizen and the constitution says you have to be- doesn‚Äôt that open up the doors for potential election challenges?
Oh the usual lol
"It's preformative, since it either didn't happen or was not counted anyway.  the election process worked as intended before they made this new law that fixes something that wasn't a problem to begin with just so they score some political points and look like they are doing something."
*citation needed
LOL.
not for federal elections and not sure about state mostly its regional or local.
Thinking California can flip red is just as delusional as thinking Texas can go blue.
"I believe it was only for local. Like you can vote for city council and stuff, but not house rep or senator"
Texas is closer to going purple/blue than Cali Red.

Seems like this guy just wants attention."
What are we supposed to say?
"Interesting that he claims using ‚Äúladies‚Äù was the reason, and not attempting to negotiate for more than the $150,000 he was already offered. Which seems more likely: having an offer rescinded for addressing women with a term that has, for several generations, been considered respectful, or having an offer rescinded because his desired salary was outside of the range they were willing to pay?

If were something like the former, the email exchange probably would have been in the article."
Definitely no ladies in that organization.
I mean- they might just using using this as a (bullshit) excuse to stop the negotiation when he started to push for a larger compensation package. I bet they had a few candidates and someone else was either willing to do the job for less or they were they correct demographic (not a white male)... So they plucked this nonsense excuse from their butts.
Failed the ideological purity test.  This is how the left wing entrenched itself into an oppressive force

Anyone who unironically uses the term 'microaggression' deserves to be slapped.
"I thought the whole point of micro aggressions was to have a conversation and communicate to the person why it offends you. Blacklisting someone then badmouthing them to the press for a simple mistake (that shouldn‚Äôt really get people offended to begin with) is insane

Clever like a fox.  This will drive the leftists nuts.  Then when a more moderate Republican gets the nomination they will be relieved and not bother to vote.
Kemp would run away with the Senate seat in 2026.  He's the *obvious* choice.

"my opinion of Trump has been going steadily downhill....not sure why he has come out swinging against someone who hasn't even announced yet. It's all good when he's attacking the opposition, but what he's doing now seems childish and undisciplined. If he were to lose the primary against DeSantis, he'll have done enough damage to seriously help whoever would be running on the democrat ticket."
"> DeSantis is taking heat over past votes

*As well he should.* His career as a politician should be a total reflection on how he would perform in office and what policies he would push for. He hasn't had to deal with any flak in his current Governor position from Republicans because the Legislature there has given him softball Conservative bills that all he had to do was sign. It wouldn't be the same if he were President with a hostile Congress in D.C. DeSantis would either sidle up to the Establishment to get things accomplished so that he can appear successful, he would be weak and simply be a lame duck in the role like Biden is today, or he would push for Executive Orders that would serve the public.

We definitely don't want the first two options. And we already have the third in President Trump who I believe would handle the job much better because he knows what to expect and how the system works there already.

I have always been skeptical about DeSantis and his true motives long before Trump started talking about him. I would be more apt to look at DeSantis and consider voting for him if we didn't have Trump who is still eligible to be back in the White House. But as long as Trump is a possibility, then he is the only candidate that I will consider voting for because of his successes that he had when he was in there before, even with the Uniparty's dislike/hatred of him."
"When you officially announce, there are rules and guidelines to follow. DeSantis plans on running, but if he doesn't announce he's running, he can get away with more.

Trump announced he was running because he was informed that he may be shielded from legal action while campaigning. Which if you look back, the RNC gave him the ultimatum that he if announces a bid, then they wouldn't cover future legal costs. Whereas Trump is more concerned about the outcome of the legal troubles than having to pay. Something he's been good at not doing for decades. So he announced his bid."
Ok what bills did he vote for or against as a congressman that has you so skeptical?  Not to mention as Governor of Florida he has line item veto.  So if he has a long track record in congress and ability to remove anything he doesn‚Äôt like in any of the bills the Florida congress oassss. Everything I‚Äôve seen seems more conservative than Trump.   Basically seems like a smear campaign which is highly likely since Trump can‚Äôt shut up about him.
"What donors or agenda? The guys been pretty consistent‚Ä¶ so not sure why you were ‚Äòon board‚Äô but aren‚Äôt anymore. 

Also, the RINOs argument is so cringe at this point. Like Trump is some sort of bastion of conservative thought or something. I liked that the guy governed conservatively but to back him and call out others for not being sufficiently ‚Äòconservative‚Äô enough‚Ä¶ is silly. The former Dem expresses non conservative thoughts all the time. 

We also should embrace the fact that we‚Äôve become the big tent party in this country‚Ä¶ but some want to kick out whoever doesn‚Äôt exactly align with their beliefs‚Ä¶ well buddy, that‚Äôs how you lose elections. And we‚Äôll lose in ‚Äò24 with Trump because no moderates or ‚ÄòRINOs‚Äô will vote for him."
Remember anything that happened when Trump was president he gets 100% credit for. Anything negative is just MSM propaganda. DeSantis gets no credit for anything good about Florida because all he does is sign bills. Anyone that doesn't bow to Trump is a RINO. That seems to be the line for the hardcore MAGA types.
And losing in 2024 isn‚Äôt even a *theory*. Trump already lost in 2020. People need to stop pushing a candidate that LOST already. Absolutely ridiculous.

"Personally, it's too early to know whether this indictment is legit.  We have no idea what the charges are or what the evidence to support them is.
  
What I do know is that the DA who is bringing these charges ran for office with a campaign promise that he would target Trump.  And the same DA has also not prosecuted crimes in his district to the fullest extent of the law.
  
These are factors in my assessment of the validity of this prosecution in combination with the charges and the evidence."

Hardly. Compromises are par for the course in Finnish politics, and compromising with PS isn't somehow inherently more lucrative than compromising with SDP.

I would say that NCP+Finns would have an easier time agreeing on domestic issues, while NCP+SDP would have an easier time on foreign policy issues, but NCP+SDP without Keskusta would still mean they could consolidate welfare regions. Keskusta has demanded an unreasonable and inefficient amount of regions that no one really wanted and no economist thought was a good idea, though opinions on the whole reform (started under the previous agrarian/conservative Sipil√§ government) are rather negative among economists as far as I can tell.

Point being, NCP+SDP might be able to consolidate and cut spending possibly quite easily in some areas, though probably easier in other areas with PS and Keskusta."
Isnt it wild that in Finland that the right-wing party that won is considered the same level in political goals/ideas as democrats in the US but in the US democrats are considered/atleast called far left extremists when on the global scale theyre just aligned with the average right winger?

You should check who was in government in 2016 ;)
The winning party kokoomus is still significantly more left than American democrats. We have a very different definition of left and right in Europe
For an incumbent she did well. Her party grew in popularity during her term which is rare. The other party just grew more as they have a very aggressive pro NATO and Ukraine stance.
She got the second most votes. This doesn‚Äôt compromize her competency.
"SHE did well, and her party also grew. But other parties grew even more.

The Greens are the big losers."
Has been disproven
"The party that won strongly supports Ukraine and NATO, so it must be more economic in nature. Cutting spending seems to be the main driver."
"In the Nordics the coalition in power tends to change every or every other election regardless of policy or world events etc. The party in power will always be blamed for problems, people want change, new party in power, change is hard, cycle continues. 

Most of the work that made the Nordics so highly developed and revered internationally  was done in the 60's, 70's and 80's or earlier when the Social democrats often had a majority government. Nowadays basically nothing is done by the government."
This was not where i imagined to find a reasonable multi perspective opinion on the election but ill take it.
"I wouldn't call Finland a good indicator of politics on a ""global scale""."
Democrats in America dont want to solve problems. They want to blame others. Much easier.
Important distinction between her and her party SDP. She is really popular and I think she got the second most amount of votes overall but her party is not that popular
Still her party came in third place. Would be interesting to see which parties Marin's party's gains came at the expense of. I'm thinking some of those would have been parties that were in coalition with her government.
"It is generally like that throughout the world. Almost all parties in the western europe, asia, Autralia are economically left to democrats. But many of them are culturally right."

I mean youre correct but I had more meant overall Europe. The countries that are in the same category as ours are all similar in this notion. In most developed countries the right-wing support and generally accept what in America is a tooth and claw battle. People in the average political right in other European countries wouldnt dare to run on a platform of removing universal healthcare or free college or unions or ‚Äúlivable wages‚Äù  because even their base support those notions and would throw a fit if the politicians tried removing them. Whereas here some politicians sole selling point is literally ‚ÄúI will fight for your right to pay 100s if not 1000s of dollars a month towards insurance you still better not need cause youll still be put in debt or paying for your 6 year degree 25 years later‚Äù and people legitimately are like ‚ÄúOmg thank you so much for fighting against socialized communist fascism as hard as you do we‚Äôll elect you for the next 40 years‚Äù

"The NCP are culturally left too. Pro LGBT, pro abortion, even pro immigration. They're only economically right"

The US isn't anything special here, other countries have this bs too."
"Which is why in the US, poor people vote for the party whose politics is ""f*ck poor people"" - because in the US the cultural narrative overrides the economic one."
The party is left leaning and only leans right on economically aspects just take a look at what the support.
You have lived in the country of Europe?
"I'm not an American, but I seriously doubt your right-wing voters would ever vote for a party that is pro-LGBT, pro-abortion, pro-welfare state, pro-immigration, wants to fight climate change, wants to increase funding for higher education and science research, accessible healthcare, etc. 

All these things are what right-wingers are always fighting against. American right-wing is systematically fighting against all of this. And suddenly you think they would win in a landslide? I thought we were all commie europoors here?"

"I knew you meant Europe, but Europe is a tiny fragment of the world's population. And I don't think every country in Europe has ""fee"" college or ""universal"" healthcare (however you define that term). [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_countries\_with\_universal\_health\_care#Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_with_universal_health_care#Europe)

Looks like the health systems in many countries are the same as they are in the U.S.: a mix of public and private insurance options. Though some European countries actually run the hospitals instead of paying for them."
"The losses were mostly other parties in Marin's coalition. Which is easy enough to predict: her party gained seats but lost power, ergo most of her gains came at the expense of her allies, which the chart confirms."
"That‚Äôs how most of the world is. People have to stop looking at other country‚Äôs from their countries lens. Modi is called far right fascist but he has extended abortion from 20 to 24 weeks, increased the minimum age of marriage from 18 to 21 so that more girls go to college, have been doing on free and direct transfer of money, free housing for the poor, increased free food grains to the poor etc.,  


There is a running joke we have at our uni in the UK. If Biden was British, he would be conservative. If he was Indian, he wouldn‚Äôt be elected because he will be considered economically far right."
So you are saying that being ‚Äúpro personal rights‚Äù is the opposite of what conservatives want.
You mean Economically left? Makes sense.

"Haha sorry I was typing quick. I meant due to travel for work I spent about 15 years living in Europe, specifically Greece/UK/Germany and the majority of the Balkans.

No economically right. The only part if their platform that is right wing is their economic policies but even that still has left wing elements to it.
"Hate to burst your bubble, but not every country works like US and UK. In fact, most don't. Idc whether you believe me or not, but most countries do in fact measure the direction of their policies by cultural aspects. The thing is that culture and economy are extremely intertwined to begin with. The way an economy is shaped is often decided by what kind of society you have, or wish to cultivate, makes sense aye? You can have a neoliberal economy and a culturally left-leaning state - Germany being the best example (and perhaps France, if you consider Macron as left-wing)."

"I think small government could mean different things. If it means, local and state governments make more decision without federal interference (or local governments make decisions with less state interference), I think that'd be popular. If ""small government"" means big cuts to social safety net, or getting rid of protections for the environment or worker's rights (including worker's rights not to be ""woke""), then that would be drastically unpopular.

For example we saw numerous conservative states try to override local governments to ban mask mandates."
"Oh ok, misunderstood. thanks."
"Macron is definitely not left wing. He is right wing in both economically and culturally.

In Germany all major parties are in the Right compare to the Left. Olaf, Angela, Baerbock all of them in the so-called 'centre-left/right'. 'The Left' party is a leftist party in all aspects.

Liberals are Right wingers."
"Yeah pretty much. The Balkans are a much different political atmosphere than most of the rest of European continent countries. If I‚Äôm being honest, I truly believe Greece is much closer to Balkan politics than the  European Union politics as a quick example, which is why I distinguished between Balkans VS EU locations! And neither is relative similar to the US. Personal responsibility is much more intense here VS communal responsibility"
"Regardless of what level of government interferes with individual liberty, it is stil the government interfering with individual liberty. Which, again, lots of state and local conservative governments have engaged in. Using 'states rights' to stick any government nose into other people's business ain't my bag."

"They truly hate conservatives, but I think they they nor only completely misunderstand what conservatives are and how they think (the ole conservatives are evil) but they don't even get the evolution of politics.  For example they often go on about how they can't wait for all these evil old conservatives to finally die without realizing they are being replaced by new people becoming conservatives as they age.  Most people start out left leaning and become more conservative as they age, but another thing is that people have goals and when those goals are achieved they will tend to stop and usually that means becoming conservative.  For example loads of people could have been roped in with the progressive antislavery camp but once slavery ended many effectively flipped conservative because they did not care to push further social reforms.  

The liberals seem to think that they can ""win"".  Nobody can just ""win"" the game of politics there will just be new things to be pushed for and against."

"Stop implementing the 2040 Plan and cities will stop spiraling into dystopias. The 2040 Plan is the main reason all these woke cities are falling apart. After spending billions and billions to build these aspiring utopias, tax payers will pay double or triple trying to repair the damage."

"Here is how this plays out: The obvious/expedient answer is to convert the space into housing, but that would require cutting regulation which will be a challenge. If converted into housing, property values would decrease from the increase in supply paired with the massive layoffs hitting the city. Businesses no longer bound to office space leave the state and all of that housing ends up used by remote workers in the tech industry. Without SFs insane business tax revenue, state income/property taxes would skyrocket to offset the difference. Remote workers would be priced out and opt to move to a lower COL area. San Fran becomes the new Detroit"

"McDonald‚Äôs has been going downhill for years.  I can‚Äôt do them anymore. They‚Äôve had their ups and downs over the decades, in terms of menu and food quality, but lately it seems they just said ‚Äúscrew it. We don‚Äôt care anymore if people take us or leave us. Cut corners, cut quality, remove items Willy nilly, whatever‚Äù

And this kinda sucks because we haul a lot of their perishable food stuff"
So this is where 'fight for $15' has come to. You get paid more but there will be fewer of you.
"Who still eats at McDonalds when you have Whatuburger, Chick-filet, Zaxbys, Culvers, or any ""higher quality"" fast food."
I only go to McDonald‚Äôs if they have an app coupon that‚Äôs basically free. Free bacon ranch Mccrispy with $2 purchase? That‚Äôs a sandwich and 2 apple juices for $2 as a lunch. ü§£ü§£
"I can't even remember the last time I have been to McDonald's. I have never really liked them, not even as a child."
"1994, traveling for a school track and field thing. Bus stopped at McDonald‚Äôs, so I had to eat there. As I took the first bite of the mushy whatever it was burger, I remember thinking: yup, I‚Äôm never going to eat here again. And I lived happier and healthier ever after."
But that Steak Egg and Cheese Bagel mmmmmmm
"This is EXACTLY the answer.  They'll pay the ones they have actually working for them MORE (not just talking about their excessive number of locations either), but there will be far less people staffing those operations.  Human capital has become too expensive for a lot of businesses in America now.  Some can press on through price hikes, which we've seen, but this doesn't work well for a lot of businesses.  Their entire business models are based on ""value"".  They rely on VOLUME to make up for the profit per ticket.  When and if the volume drops, the business goes into the toilet.  

It's a battle of the only the strongest, as it should be.  Trouble is, so many businesses are propped up by cheap borrowing costs and underpaying labor for the past generation.  A hard reset is needed for the US economy, and it's medicine that no one wants to take or be a part of."
"To be fair, this is regarding **corporate jobs** and not restaurant employees. Having said that, I do feel that fast food as Americans have known it will be largely unrecognizable in the future due to rising costs across the board, including labor. 

I meet a former work colleague for lunch about once a month and we usually go to a Wendy‚Äôs nearby. My last stop there I think there were two menu item meals under $10. Also, due to labor shortages and high turnover for these low level jobs, the quality has never been more hit-or-miss and often takes much longer to prepare, so you‚Äôre paying more for a worse product.

How does fast food as a category survive when it‚Äôs no longer affordable, fast, or as well prepared as before? These corporate layoffs will just be the next wave of this new reality. I think fast casual restaurants will start to be the new normal and that traditional fast food chains who compete primarily on pricing will bite the dust.

EDIT: also, I‚Äôm originally from Pittsburgh, and the last McDonald‚Äôs located in the downtown footprint has or is about to shutter its doors, and locals on the sub-Reddit are cheering about it as if the largest global food chain and its affiliates deciding that your major city is no longer a viable spot to have a business is somehow progress and positive change. Utterly delusional."
Last time I went to a McDonals I ordered a 1/4 pounder and chicken sandwich.  I was completely covered in mud from an all day hiking trip and it was the only drive through.  The chicken sandwich was so bad that even after hiking 9 hours and suffering from exhaustion it was still too horrible to stomach.   Ended up getting chucked after two bites.
"I'm  surprised people didn't figure this out earlier.  That's what has always happened.  I used to bring this up on Reddit and I would get flamed pretty hard.  

Corporations don't care about people.  They only care about keeping shareholders happy by making profits.  They will always cut jobs to save a few bucks and put the work on whoever remains."
Well mcd is like subway. It's everywhere and that includes tons of places that don't have anything else. People forget that locations outside of cities are real.
"> Whatuburger, Chick-filet, Zaxbys, Culvers

Those aren't nation-wide. In the Northesast there's just...Five Guys, I guess?"
"I don't eat at Mc D's and prefer 5 Guys for burgers.  There aren't many other options nearby. A burger and fries at 5 Guys is almost 2x the cost at Mc D's.   Sure, 5 guys tastes better and is fresh.  Their fries are cut from sacks of potatoes from local farms.    I know a few people who choose Mc Ds because it's cheaper, not better."
Sometimes I gotta have a quarter pounder. and there‚Äôs a mickey dee‚Äôs very close to me.
"That really has been the tale of fast food transformation the past two decades. People will willingly pay a minor increase in price for a major increase in quality, particularly if costs keep escalating overall and make substitution choices even more viable.

The sub sandwich is a great case study. Jersey Mike‚Äôs and Jimmy John‚Äôs are eating Subway‚Äôs lunch‚Äîpun intended. Old brands that stayed stale, raised prices, and decreased quality are going to have a hard time rebounding when newer brands with better customer satisfaction are now competing."
"whataburger is gross, more grease than food."
"I find these app-exclusive coupons to be unfair. Not everybody has a smartphone. And many that do, don't want to load it up with apps."
I rarely go to them anymore.  Maybe once a month.  I used to go when they had the chicken selects but once they got rid of those I stopped going except on the rare occasion where I crave some chicken nuggets.
For real.   Best thing they have ever had at their menu.
"I absolutely love me some McDonald‚Äôs, but when I tried that steak bagel it felt like I was eating a giant grease sponge. Is that expected?"
"yeah, whatever your version of ""good"" fast food. Rural areas is mainly McDonalds. But not everywhere."
"Word. Subway is so gross compared to any other sandwich place. There meatballs used to be actual ground beef, compared to the bouncy meat paste balls they have now."
"As apposed to McDonald‚Äôs? More paper pulp and unknown filler than meat. Lower grade beef than dog food. Buns so preserved they won‚Äôt mold for decades.   

Grease comes from actual meat. I‚Äôll take the grease."
Pretty much lol. Not something you wanna eat every day that is for sure.
I agree mcdonalds is gross as well hell it's much worse. i just have had bad experiences at whataburger.
"To be fair, the whataburger by my house is pretty gross too. Ya gotta find a good one. I‚Äôd take in-n-out over it. The fries taste super weird but it‚Äôs aways clean at least."

Much better details in this story. This isn't some random rape story. 

New York, NEW YORK!"
But it was a mostly peaceful abduction and rape.
"So when will she be arrested ? Bragg is on a roll arresting victims, well get to find out what this one did wrong."
So now will she be charged with possibly giving him a std.
Thank goodness they didn‚Äôt have guns or she would have *really* been in trouble.
"Huh, they've moved on to mobile sex dungeons. I'm sure he'll get it out of impound minutes after his charges are substantially reduced or dropped."

"They don't have time for that in NY, too busy going after Trump."

"NYC seems like a great place, I gotta get out there"
"Where is the rise of vigilantism? I‚Äôm sick of reading headlines about these tragedies where the victim ends up fucked over without any justice, because our judicial system is a friggin dumpster fire? Honestly makes me wanna take to the streets at night and hunt despicable people like this."

But what if the criminal also has a gun? Rape at gun point?
She'll be charged with trespassing and harassing the RV's owner.
I‚Äôm sure Fat Alvin is on the case. Trying to get it dropped to a misdemeanor now. Kamala is ready with the bail money if they decide to hold him.
"Democrats cried out in unison: ""We need to harness the full power of the government, corporations, and the media, in order to get rid of this fascist! (who peacefully gave up power despite a evidence of election fraud, and didn't prosecute his political opponents while in office)"""
Bragg is in Manhattan. This happened in Staten Island.
I don‚Äôt understand. Can‚Äôt a law enforcement agency focus on more than one crime? This argument doesn‚Äôt make sense.
"Next week: The alleged attacker claimed she had mumbled something racist, so the attack was justified. The state later declined to prosecute."
"Why would the GOP allow this to happen to this girl?

EDIT: I'm joking!"
How is that relevant
"Well first of all, she resisted arrest."
Sounds ridiculous but it‚Äôll probably happen!üòú
"You mean good thing she didn't have guns, so she only got raped by the criminals and not also the NY justice system."
"Republicans could make a play for suburban women by pushing the death penalty for rapes with aggravating factors. Rape during the commission of a felony (break-ins, abductions, felony assault, use of a weapon) could be easily separated from date rapes, statutory rapes, and the occasional false accusation."
Rape should be treated with crucifixion it's the worst possible crime
"It‚Äôs essentially an RV. The thumbnail is a photo of the rapists bus, he lives there and it looks stationary for the most part."
The feeling is mutual: Democrat leaders love criminals!
"I can‚Äôt wait for Soros to bite the dust, just a shame we gotta wait for it since people don‚Äôt have the balls to go after him."
"It was a private RV, not a city bus. Perpetrator lived in it as his mobile home."
Not a public bus.

"Hey, hey, hey! It‚Äôs Fat Alvin!"
Fat Alvin üòÇ
Close enough. They arrested a guy recently for shooting aa robber who was shooting at him and a few weeks back arrested a shop keep for stabbing someone trying to rob and murder him in his store.
"Today: rapist arrested, released without bail /s"
I like how any morals go out the window as soon as something racist was said. Two wrongs don't make a right but for some people when they feel wronged they have to take revenge.
: update he kills 10 cops and the jury than rapes 20 more people
You‚Äôre a sick person
What are the odds that the guy was already released on no cash bail for at least one crime and has been earlier also charged with similar crimes that were reduced to misdemeanors?
"Amazing the idea of force equalizers is so foreign to so many people.

Criminals benefit **significantly** more from the removal of firearms from a situation, since they are going to go after smaller and weaker targets. 

A 90lb woman with a baseball bat protecting herself may as well roll over and give up against a 250lb criminal with a baseball bat.

"Clearly YOU WERE.  The Cops killed 1 person who was not armed.  The only other death was from natural causes.  There was no destruction of property, like there was in 2016.  After Trump was announced the winner.  Or did you magically forget the businesses that were burned, cars overturned and burned.  And RIOTS that ensued.  Because Killery wasn't elected for Obama 3rd term."

"Fair comment, but that would mean the headline is a guess no ?

Look, it's an awful crime, but the title suggests it happened on a city bus (to someone with my UK eyes) when it seems it happened on a private bus (an RV).

Hell of a serious crime, but it probably didn't happen in the place the title suggests.

That was my only point.

I'm sorry if we misunderstand each other."
"Yeah, screw that. My family didn't live in poverty or work as hard as they did for me to vote back in the same shit that we ran away from. That would be the most dishonorable thing I could do to my parents and ancestors who worked as hard as they did just to give me a fighting chance."

"I get that the title is misleading - didn't mean to say it wouldn't have been. I also though first it happened in a city bus. My point was just that the crime wasn't any less horrible, for the reason that ""The girl should have known not to go to some random person's RV"", because she was abducted and taken there."
"This is why their ideology will eventually be self-defeating. They want to both maximize immigration while also not recognizing the trend that their rhetoric is unappealing to people who have actually lived under their ideology in many of the places these people emigrated from. It's also why they're pushing younger and younger for indoctrination and harder and harder on censorship.

You should know though, failure to adhere to the ""oppressed minority"" set of standards they've built for you is much more likely to get the Asian community simply lumped in with the ""oppressor"" group, rather than trigger any kind of self-reflection or questioning of the underlying ideology."
That‚Äôs not the fucking point. Did they or did they not steal a computer from a congressional office and then try to sell it?
"The problem with your theory is that as long as we have open borders and a generous welfare state, there's no way to guarantee the people coming in aren't just going to vote for the same shit that wrecked their country of origin.

I've heard that Pelosi's laptop was stolen but not that anyone had tried to sell it. Got a link for that? I wouldn't be surprised if someone tried to sell it but why China or Russia. There are a lot of Americans who would like to see what was on that laptop.

"This title is incredibly misleading because Japan went and received permission to do this from the United States. The reality is that Russian oil was important to global supply and the world can't live without that oil without serious pain.

"We could always try another oil embargo on Japan.. /s

"Japan has only two incentives to side with the Western bloc here and a huge one to break. If Ukraine wins, Japan may be able to get Kuril Islands back. Also, they‚Äôre allied with the US. However, they import the 2nd most oil in the world and with Russia‚Äôs oil prices collapsing, they can get a lot of it for much cheaper than the middle eastern oil they usually get."
Imagine if we didn't have to beg these countries for oil. We were becoming that way under Trump but Biden came in and screwed it all up...
So can someone ELIM5  why Japan is doing this?
No cap.
"We are in serious danger of completely destroying our relationship with Japan. They've been one of our closest allies since the end of WW2.

"And with that, we have officially lost our status in the world. With the incoming BRIC trade currency, our lack of energy production and the inability to exert any measurable control in the world stage, we have slipped out and let China/Russia/Saudi take the lead collectively."

This sounds like a an attempt by the opec and china and russia to undermine the US and the dollar and force a recession
So Biden has driven India and Japan towards Russia? Democrats are doing amazing on foreign policy.
A surprising amount of electricity generation in Japan is directly oil fired. Perhaps now they wish they had kept a few more nuclear reactors running.
Now that the ice is broken more will follow.
What an unmitigated disaster this admin is.
"Misleading title, Japan spoke with US prior."
This title is misleading. Japan ‚Äúasked‚Äù the U.S. if they could buy above the cap. as they have high dependency on Russian oil.
Japan is just taking care of Japan. Maybe America can learn something.
"We always knew once it got going, it would move fast."
We should be.
"We're too busy trying to supply Europe (after blowing up nordstream, change my mind) to make up for the Russian imports they cut themselves off from with sanctions. 

Aside from that, Western countries are making sure that ship sails by going green asap, which in turn is leaving developing countries and countries like Japan which rely heavily on oil and LNG imports no other choice but to turn to those who will still supply them."
"We are even more of a net positive energy exporter than at any previous time. For all that Biden has messed up many things, the oil companies are doing their thing.

">The key insight here is that this move indicates that the US values Japan over Europe.

I gotta disagree. What this actually indicates is that in East Asia, unlike Europe, there are major industrialized countries which are not aliged with the West (read: China) and would be willing to buy up this oil and LNG if Japan/SK don't want it. (The supplies we're talking about here are produced in Russia's Far East.)

In Europe, there are no nearby alternative customers the Russian's could turn to. Instead, they now have to ship the oil and natural gas which were previously going a short distance to Europe (from oil and gas fields in the European parts of Russia!)  half-way around the globe to China or India, increasing the shipping and insurance costs and restricting the capacity.

So the key difference is that the West/the US/NATO have hegemony over all of Europe to the west of Belarus, while East Asia is geopolitically divided between our adversaries (China, NK) and our allies (Japan, SK)."
Kind of disagree. The politicians in the US are catering  to climate activists and not acting with common sense. It is hurting both the US and the world.
thanks for sharing
"> and the world can't live without that oil without serious pain

I'm willing to incur a little pain to defeat Russia."

"Also now that Japan is increasing their military budget, slowly they will become stronger and soon maybe in a decade ask US to leave Japan. If they do US will lose any influence in the region.

Chinese will take Taiwan that way. For people who think they will land troops in Taiwan like US did in Normandy, they don't understand Chinese. 

Chinese will bribe people in positions of power to gain influence. They may bribe enough politicians in Japan to ask US to leave. Similarly they will get Taiwan to merge with China by bribing almost all the politicians in Taiwan parliament.

Only answer is maintain US influence in the region of South China Sea. And bribe more. But Brandon has slowly destroyed US influence in the region. I was excited when Trump announced China as the real threat."
They need oil and the Russians have cheap oil. end of story. If there were scientologists operating a gas station down the road from you selling gas for half price do you think people would buy it even though it is supporting a pretty evil organization?
We're not in danger of destroying our relationship with Japan.
"Some context for those that didn‚Äôt even bother to read it

*Japan has almost none of its own fossil fuels, heavily relying on imports for much of its energy needs*

*Japan has begun purchasing Russian crude oil above the $60-a-barrel cap, breaking with western allies thanks to an exception authorized by the United States*

*Despite the concession, Russian natural-gas imports to Japan are relatively small, accounting for around one-tenth of Japan‚Äôs supply and a fraction of Russia‚Äôs output*"
The US allowed the exemption for them how are we hurting our relationship?
Cap is a Gen Z thing.
Started with? That‚Äôs exactly what Ukraine is asking for
"They were given an exemption to buy $52 million dollars worth of oil over 2 months at around $70 per barrel because it was a byproduct of a natural gas contract that was already signed. It's literally nothing. Japan bought about $4.6 billion in natural gas in the contract year 2022, the oil is just something that is also produced alongside the natural gas, so they buy it as well. Japanese companies also own 22.5% of the company supplying both the LNG and oil, so there's certainly some lobbying there."
We could be too...
We would have plenty to go around if not for Bidens terrible policies.
"Those green activists will kneecap any chance West has at getting the influence in the world. China will overwhelm US soon, with all of Brandons China first policies. I am saying it as a citizen of a country, worried about growing Chinese influence."
"> after blowing up nordstream, change my mind)

It would mean the end of our alliances in Europe. Seriously, if any evidence came out to support this conspiracy theory, NATO would be done. Biden and his administration are incompetent, but not that incompetent.

It's more likely (though not very likely) that Germany went and bombed it so that they could make their country fully green with all that solar electricity they are generating (or not generating)."
OPEC production cuts are not going to help with the Russian sanctions ether
"It‚Äôs very misleading if your understanding is based on a single article.

They have to ask *Turkey* permission to join NATO... lol
"The US, and Japan have a completely different relationship than most nations."
"Yes, but I couldn't pass up the sarcastic reference. 

And no, it's not really that different. In the end, both countries are doing what they need to do to survive. One just happens to be a much closer ally than the other, though we were well on our way to bringing India into our sphere of influence until Blinkin showed up."

If faced with an existential threat, I think Germany would begrudgingly overlook its largest NATO ally taking out infrastructure, especially if that NATO ally is in turn supplying it with what the pipeline was providing.

And you assume that Biden is more than a mouthpiece. I think it's fair to suggest that more than one person currently holds the power of that particular office.  They just need Biden to publicly back it.  I could be wrong, though, and that's ok."

"One thing about this is China has lesser time than US. I mean US can wait forever, but Chinese degraphic collapse is inevitable in 2-3 decades. So before that they need control over countries which can grant them a lot of slave labour."
The US keeps pushing Taiwan down the same path as the Ukraine and there will be war. China will win and a lot of Taiwanese will die. If I was Taiwan I would be looking at the Ukraine war and be like we need to start negotiating. China just needs to save face and have a win even if it is just on paper.
Yeah. Sure.
If only there was some way to do it...
"Canceled new permits in productive areas, lowest lease sales since ww2, tons of new fees and regs, ESG discouraging investing in energy - in addition to pumping all cash into Chinese solar etc. with more to come. He said he would destroy it and is."
The deep state holds NATO as paramount to their global power. It's part of the reason they turned against Trump in such an extreme way. Look at how much the DoD whined and complained about Trump pulling out of Syria and leaving it to the Kurds.
"So this wasn't an American conspiracy, but a NATO conspiracy? To what end? European countries could have just turned the pipe line off. Europeans in general are fairly complicit about energy and think the world is going to end due to climate change. They wouldn't have had that much blow back from their populations.

I would agree that a NATO conspiracy is more believable than a US solo operation. Though I think they would have had better options than blowing it up."
"Ukraine doesn't have the capability. But they are benefiting from it all the same with their pipeline being in use. So is Biden.

Thing to remember is that for a short time last year, as the German protests started picking up steam (they just wanted things to be affordable again), Olaf Scholz was starting to waver on the sanctions. Germany being a kind of defacto leader of the EU, this would mean other countries would perhaps follow suit.  The attack on the pipeline basically ended this possibility. We also can't discount that the Swedish Navy claimed it spotted an underwater drone near the pipeline a short time before the attack."
"That's possible, definitely more so than the US doing it at massive risk to itself with no real benefit. Even a Chinese covert mission is more believable.

The DoD would have really have gone completely brain dead if they supported such an act. Look at when Trump decided to pull out of Syria and leave the Syrian Kurds to Turkey and how the brass acted after that. This would be infinitely worse than that. They would be flipping their shit and resigning in mass. NATO means everything to them."
We could be much more dominant if he wasn‚Äôt trying to fulfill the campaign promise to destroy the industry.

not how japans politics work at all. Very different politically than america by a lot.
"Oh, you're implying a vast corruption scheme within the Japanese government. I'm not familiar enough with their politics to know how true that is. If it's anything like the United States, then that could be believable. Japanese culture is way more insular though, where the US is more integrated into global governance and power plays. A corrupt politician in Japan probably doesn't have the same world view as a person like Bloomberg."
"China wouldn't ever need to take over Japan.  That would create a forever proxy war between the rest of the free world's submarines/drones and any Chinese ships that dare to sail within 20 miles of the Japanese coast.

Even Russia would join in to protect their access to the Pacific, though they would always lie and say the American navy did it."

Excellent summary.

That's were you're wrong imo. The more wealthy classes were okay but lower middle class citizens, especially in poorer countries, were not. They already had protests to turn the pipelines back on in the first month after the war had begun after energy bills went thru the roof."

"Yes i agree. But Japan is not a poor country by any standards. If Pakistan can maintain nukes, Japan can certainly do it. All it needs is a will.

"Trump was what we needed in 2016. Someone who was willing to call out all of the bullshit on the Left and wake people up a little. 2020 election chicanery aside though, that element of his platform isn't unique anymore and his baggage is significant, even if not entirely fair. DeSantis, at least in my opinion, combines Trump's attitude with a more principled conservative stance but drops most of what made Trump such an easy target. Plus, DeSantis wouldn't turn 80 while in office.

Will I vote for Trump if he's the Republican nominee for the general in 2024? Yes. But will I probably vote for DeSantis in the primary? Also yes."
"In the end, while I prefer conservative values, people are cult-like on both sides of the aisle. There was a lot to like about Trump but also a lot to hate. A portion of the Republican voting base has gone so deep into being on his ""team"" that they don't care about any other logic like the fact that he will lose after they nominate him.

We all either know or are these people. The ones who define their personality over being a Trump supporter. They feed off the energy of saying screw you to the Trump haters. They act rude to people and then call them snowflakes. They will deliver another term of Biden which should be unthinkable."
It‚Äôs not that people think he‚Äôs a better nominee it‚Äôs that Trump has made an emotional connection to people who feel the political class has betrayed them for generations. That connection is why the witch hunt or all the real flaws things that Trump has don‚Äôt matter. Not that most voters really care about policy issues and debate points. Emotion is usually the reason people support their candidate.
"He was the original wake up call. He got a large swath of Americans to care about politics for the first time in decades. If people are still riding with him, it‚Äôs likely because they were part of that group. I myself have plenty of family/friends that didn‚Äôt care at all till 2016."
"The left is correct that some people are a bit too cultish about trump. He puts his pants on every day like everyone else, and his recent displays imo make him unfit for another run. I think he did great in 2016 but I think he is losing it a bit. Leave romanticization and overdramatizing of candidates to the left."
"I don't.  I would like a true fiscal conservative who pushes congress critters to balance the damn budget for once.  Trump's strategy is lower taxes AND increased spending which doesn't work long term.  

That said, I like that he calls it like he sees it.  I like that he talks directly to his constituents even if it's off the cuff and a bit cringe at times.  I'll take cringe over carefully crafted bullshit delivered by an ivy league communications team. I don't like that he's supposed to be an expert at surrounding himself with the right people, but failed at that during his presidency.  

Like many people here, I'll vote against him in the primary and for him if he wins the primary."
The popular vote is irrelevant. New York City and Los Angeles ensure that a Republican will never win the popular vote again. It‚Äôs not just a Trump problem.
"I‚Äôm pro-DeSantis, but I think a big argument is that Trump has better odds in the rust belt, which republicans NEED to win to have the presidency. Trump is the only Republican in a few decades to win any of WI/MI/PA, and even in 2020 he was within a few % points of all 3 states. He has more appeal to that white working class rural base, which DeSantis may not really have 

Those WWC rust belt voters are usually more socially moderate and economically populist. So the fear is that someone like DeSantis who is strong again the anti-woke stuff won‚Äôt appeal to them as much, and he‚Äôs more of a traditional conservative on issues like trade while again protectionist Trump may be a better fit for that region 

Overall I still think there‚Äôs a lot of great arguments for desantis and against trump too, but from electoral math perspective we NEED to win at least one of WI/PA/MI to have a chance even if we secure GA/AZ/NV still. So I think the best argument for trump is he just has a special emotional connection with those rust belt voters which transcends normal policy debates or whatever, since emotion always motivates voters more anyway"
"Trump may have lost the popular vote but no Republican in history has gotten 74 million votes. Bush 2 got 50 and 62 million, Bob Dole and HW got 39 million each, Reagan himself got 43 and 54 million. Even Obama, the DNC's favorite, only got 65 and 69 million. Trump was more popular than Barack Obama and let that set in.

Not only that, but people believe Trump did a good job, he only got 62 million votes in 2016, which went up to 74 million in 2020. Can DeSantis do that with Trump working against him? I doubt it."
I don't know but Trump will lose again in 24 if he's the nominee.
"It seems to be that your premise is simply he can‚Äôt win the majority vote. Since we do not have a national popular vote - merely a number that media and the left like to tally from State vote totals - it‚Äôs difficult to know where to begin. That is, unless the purpose of this was simply to allow space to shit on Trump. 

I personally believe both are qualified and capable and would excel in different ways for different reasons. I struggle with Trump‚Äôs attacking of DeSantis as it leaves a bad taste in my mouth being so far out from primaries and DeSantis is not even an announced candidate. Not all, but many of the arguments against Trump can be boiled down to likability. In Trump we had a person, not just q candidate, who had a national recognition before running. It was mostly positive. To think that any other candidate - assuming one that is not of the McConnell wing - won‚Äôt be made to be as loathed and vilified as Trump is naive, in my opinion. If that‚Äôs the case, why does it matter? I grant there are other arguments, too."
"Scorched Earth on the Administrative State (Schedule F)  
The permanent fixtures in D.C. are the greatest threat to this country as we know it."
"Idk, but the only way to get 4 more years of Biden is to run Trump. Don't do it."
"Because:

1. Some people are stuck in denial about 2020.

2. Some people believe that the 400-500 Trump signs in their town of 4,000 is an accurate representation of how the rest of the country feels.

3. Some people are obsessed with getting revenge for 2020 and not thinking clearly about the best option.

4. Some people believe Trump has a better shot than DeSantis of attracting blue collar workers in the northern Rust Belt (Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin‚Äîthe Republican basically HAS to win at least one of them to win the election, barring a very narrow path that includes Virginia).

I‚Äôm willing to at least listen to point #4, but even then we don‚Äôt have much data on DeSantis‚Äô appeal or lack of appeal to blue collar workers, and we know Trump brings out a LOT of anti-voters in those key states as well.

Personally I think DeSantis has a much better shot of winning back Arizona and Georgia than Trump does (the former Trump basically poisoned with his anti-McCain rhetoric, and the latter his anti-Kemp rhetoric isn‚Äôt helping). If DeSantis can just do better with suburban women (which I think he objectively should) he has a shot of grabbing at least one of those northern Rust Belt states and the election. That‚Äôs just my high level analysis/opinion, though."
"I don't believe any Republican can handle the national media aside from Trump. Definitely not in the style of DeSantis who chooses to ignore them. They will invent and create their own narratives. Seen it time and time before. That said, if he can survive Trump in the primary, it's an okay litmus test for what's to come in the general."
"Because the coalition Trump brings in is unique to Trump. There are voters out there that voted Obama that flipped to Trump or voters that don't normally vote, vote for Trump and Trump alone. You don't gain 12 million new voters in one term by bringing the same base, you create a new coalition. Trump speaks plainly, he speaks straight to people. Is he brash? Yes, but he speaks to a lot of forgotten voters.  I'm not saying DeSantis can't eventually bring those types of voters in, but I think it would be a lot easier to do that by running in 2028 when he becomes more established to the nation and the baton gets passed. I just think he is making a grave mistake if he runs in 2024. Like I say all the time though, I will crawl through hellfire to vote for Trump or DeSantis."
We need younger candidates for the next election. It's going to be the most important election in our lifetime next year that will determine the fate of the nation. DeSantis should be the nominee. All we have to do regardless who gets the nomination is make sure the party isn't divided by these attack ads on DeSantis and also make sure that we send our Republican friends to important swing states to make sure our election isn't stolen like it was in 2020 and 2022. Get all mules that try to cheat arrested and thrown in prison til 2031
I personally think we need someone like Trump to go after the Dems hard. They have been going very extreme and we need someone to shut it all down. He seems to be able to fight the fight. 4 years of him and then let Desantis take the reigns for 8 more.
"I hesitantly voted for him in 2016. I gladly voted for him in 2020. Now I‚Äôd begrudgingly vote for him in 2024 if he becomes the nominee. Because he keeps getting in his own way and his rhetoric alienates people (‚Äúabolish parts of the Constitution‚Äù DOES NOT jive with those who care about it). He‚Äôs not going to win hearts and minds of Independents or non-Republicans that aren‚Äôt already polarized.

Plus, he‚Äôs not going to overcome the current system. I say this as someone who believes fraud played a major part in the Safest, Freest, Securest Election Ever ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, what‚Äôs changed since 2020 to plug up the holes? Georgia‚Äôs the only state of 6 that shored up their election integrity or dialed back mass mail-in ballots. Why should we expect different results with the same candidates competing in a system identical to that from 2020?"
"No Republican will win the popular vote.  I don't think a Republican has done it since Reagan who won states that Republicans can't realistically win in today's political climate.  And it doesn't matter who the candidate is or their platform.  If there's an ""R"" next to their name they will lose too many states and cities to win the popular vote.  The cities carry too much of a dominating voting block.  That's why we have the electoral college system so cities can't run rough-shod over the rest of the country. Let's not forget that polls indicate potentially millions of voters would have changed their vote had the Hunter laptop story not been buried.

Regarding Trump's age, it is somewhat of a concern, but comparing his cognitive ability to Biden is laughable.  There were clear and obvious red flags with Biden's mental health from very early on in his campaign.  Trump has more energy than many people half his age.

To the main point of your post, I think Trump (and most people on the right) were woefully unprepared for the level of corruption in the non-political positions within government, particularly departments like the DOJ and State Dept.  And I think anyone stepping into that position will be similarly unprepared if they haven't personally faced it before.  I don't think anyone besides Trump (because of what he went through) could come into office with a full understanding of how harshly and radically these departments need to be treated.

DeSantis on the other hand will have the same exact mentality Trump did.  Things like firing the people who undermined him like Fauci, Rosenstein, Eric C., etc. are not easy to do for someone facing re-election.  Trump can go scorched earth on anyone undermining him without fear of re-election consequences.  After the numerous fiascos he went through he has a clear list of who's on his side and who isn't.

Aside from spending, Trump has a stellar track record from a policy perspective.  DeSantis is doing great on the state level, but Trump has a proven track record on the national level.

In no way would I be upset with DeSantis.  But I think if Trump were to roll over or primary voters chose someone else, it sets a dangerous precedent that if Democrats work hard enough to conjure up fake controversies and smear Republicans with fake crimes that they can sway our vote.  

Case in point that you cite Jan 6 when we now know there were numerous undercover LEO's in that crowd one of which was on tape inciting violence.  Even with incitement I am all for reasonable charges on anyone who engaged against police or damaged property.  But that doesn't mean that Trump did anything wrong there.  And I think it's foolish to let an event that looks more and more like a false flag by the day be used to sway your vote.  

**If we allow our votes to be swayed by propaganda and clandestine operations by intelligence agencies then we are inviting more russiagates, more Jan 6's, and more bogus impeachments**. 

Remember how Trump's popularity changed over time.  He was unpopular because of his antics, but as the media turned on him the primary voters turned to his side.  Then he was elected and Russiagate hit.  His approval numbers plunged.  But his approval rating slowly recovered because of policy and as truth came out about russiagate.  Then the impeachments and covid came and he lost approval ratings, but they rebounded by the election.

So it seems that he only lost approval ratings when completely manufactured stories came out.  Once the truth was revealed his approval ratings recovered.  Every time his approval ratings fell, he was eventually proven to be right and his ratings recovered. He lost approval ratings for being right. 

**Trump wasn't targeted for his personality.  People loved him when he was a Democrat.**   
 **They hated him for his policy.  If DeSantis turns out to be as much of a threat as Trump from a policy perspective, you can expect the exact same results from him**."
"He‚Äôs more popular, he‚Äôs done the job before and well, the demonic left hates him, best economy under his watch, no new wars, actually ran business‚Äô ‚Ä¶.etc‚Ä¶."
"Well my question is why do you think desantis will do better? Sure he is great in Florida, but I don't think you can extrapolate that to say he will be popular in other swing states. There are a lot of ""trump or no one"" people out there jist how there just like how there were ""bernie or bust"" people in 2016. Also sure he lost in 2020, but bidens popularity has only fallen since then. Personally I'm still not sure and fine with either one at this point"
"Desantis does not have Trump‚Äôs charisma or a national support base that‚Äôs anywhere close to Trump‚Äôs.  Maybe he can change that but time is running out to prove it.   Though it‚Äôs true that Trump attracts a lot of voters that are more interested in voting ‚Äúagainst‚Äù the GOP than voting for Biden I am highly skeptical Desantis (or anyone else) will be able to dodge this effect either.  

I guarantee they will run the same playbook smear campaign they did against Trump (and Kavanaugh) against whoever the GOP nominee is.  They will find some bimbo to make false claims about Desantis or invent some other scandal (Russian collusion probably) just like they always do.  Most people cave under that kind of pressure and negative press - Trump won‚Äôt, but not sure if Desantis can handle that."
Because they‚Äôre in a cult
"Short answer:  One guy has already done the job, has experience with it and one guy hasn‚Äôt."
What is DeSantis‚Äô take on the Iraq war? Seems like he doesn‚Äôt call out these illegal wars. Seems to me DeSantis is trying to walk a fine line but needs to make his stance clear on this.
"Because Trump was wildly successful as a president. He did what he said he was going to do, and he fought some hard-won battles to get that done. DeSantis, while he's done some amazing things as governor, it's apples and oranges. When you're governor of a state, there's very little actual opposition to what you do. There's no guarantee that DeSantis will be as good at being president as he has been as a governor.   


Worse, right now if Trump wins the presidency, we get him as president AND we get to keep DeSantis as the governor of a monumentally important key swing state. If DeSantis becomes president, we lose Trump entirely and we lose the governor seat of Florida, all on the hope that somehow DeSantis might be Trump enough to be an adequate replacement for Trump."
"January 6?  Give Me a break. And if you think brain dead Brandon really got 81 million votes, more votes than  messiah Barry, you are very naive. Zuckerbucks alone proves the election was  rigged. Ron seems great for Florida and he might be great for America but it's Trump's turn for many reasons. One is to literally make the leftists' and deep state's heads explode. Ron has an iffy Seanate record that he needs to explain. He is young enough to wait until  2028.

"Conservatives need to distance themselves from the uniparty ""republicans"". As long as it stays the ""1 party masquerading as 2"", nothing will change and we keep spiralling toward their unified agenda. They sure know all of the right things to say to get elected, but it never comes to fruition, and the agenda continues full steam ahead."
"Because he is a better candidate.

Popular vote doesn‚Äôt matter.  Don‚Äôt you know that?"
Biden got 81 million votes at a time when many states legalized ballot harvesting and mass mail out ballots. Republicans need to understand the amount of people who intend to vote on Election Day and the amount of people who actually show up is two totally different things. Democrats are able to capitalize on getting people who don‚Äôt even know when Election Day is and just walked by ‚ÄúRepublican is a Nazi‚Äù poster to immediately turn in a ballot days and weeks before an election. The big red wave did hit in the midterms but it only hit in Florida where republicans showed up early in big numbers to vote. Unless people get this it doesn‚Äôt matter who the nominee is in 2024. The democrats hope it‚Äôs Trump because they can get a lot more miles out of their pumped up anger and fundraising.
"If you actually believe 81 million people voted for that senile old coot, I've got ocean front property in AZ. I don't doubt many voted against trump just to spite him, but I am damn sure no 81 million voted for this potato in chief. I'm down for Desantis in 24 though all the way. We needed Trump in 16 as others have said. Now time for some new blood and someone that can align well with what Trump was trying to do but with a bit more tact."
"The narrative that people ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt vote FOR Biden, they voted AGAINST Trump!!!!‚Äù Is really tiresome. 

First, there was way too much suspicion with the election. Second, Trump received the most votes of any incumbent ever in the 2020 election . Third, Trump GAINED 10 million votes in 2020. You don‚Äôt receive 10 million more votes and the most of any incumbent by alienating people, or causing people to hate you so much that they vote for another candidate, one which never even campaigned or could string a sentence together. I‚Äôm so tired of trying to point these facts out to people just for it to get brushed by the wayside. No one lives in a factual world anymore and it‚Äôs really sad. 

Add in the facts that DeSantis hasn‚Äôt even said he‚Äôs running but people keep living in their own false factual world by acting like it‚Äôs a done deal, despite him flat out stating he won‚Äôt run against Trump, and he‚Äôs already getting the backing from every RINO like Romney, McConnell, and the Bush‚Äôs.

Look, I‚Äôll vote for DeSantis if he‚Äôs the nominee, but I and many people already know what we got with Trump who I have full faith in that could actually start to clean up some of this shit mess we‚Äôre in. Everyone else would just seem business as usual."
"Neither one will win imo. Idk who else could get the nom but I‚Äôm really hoping someone emerges, can‚Äôt have four more years of this"
He served a purpose. At this point I feel like he's just running for the memes. Or ego. I would like to see what US politics looks like without a cartoon mascot as president. It's been a while
Trump never went to high school parties as a grown ass man
"I believe Trump to be the more genuine of the two candidates. He speaks his mind. DeSantis has shown himself to allow for government overreach in order to punish political adversaries. If the shoe were on the other foot, conservatives would be yelling from the rooftops. 

Regarding foreign policy, Trump is willing to make hard decisions in regards to NATO and America-first policies, whereas DeSantis has shown willingness to continue to fund proxy wars (Ukraine). This is less than ideal for those of us with conservative libertarian ideals.

Joe‚Äôs been such a disaster, either Trump or DeSantis will win and will get things back on track, comparatively, I believe. Vote, vote, vote!"
"If you think DeSoros could stand the pressure of political prosecution for 5 minutes without cracking you're kidding yourself. He flipflopped on UKR in a day, same on Trumps prosecution. Didn't the statue of limitations run out on this thing & the typical punishment (what Hilary got) was just a fine. This isn't Trump creating drama it's a level of political prosecution that is unavoidable to anyone that puts up any resistance to the permanent uniparty establishment."
"Because Trump is more popular, started no wars as president and kept his promises. Plus he negotiated peace with North Korea and made other deals. He was also able to keep money in people's pockets without sending billions overseas as well as keeping gas prices low. And him not winning the popular vote is irrelevant, that doesn't decide the presidency. 

Regardless of you saying that the votes against Trump are for ""not Trump"" and don't count towards Biden is all lies. They were definitely for Biden. You're also delusional if you think Biden got 81 million votes..."
"1. **Let DeSantis continue to develop Florida as the conservative role model.** He would be practically unopposed on the Conservative ticket in 2028. It avoids infighting and gives us the absolute strongest position.

2. The vast majority of peoples‚Äô view on Trump is controlled by what the mainstream media says, and they‚Äôre obviously not trustworthy.

3. **We know things were actually GREAT under Trump.** Lower taxes, much better economy, the ‚ÄòTrump‚Äô effect on immigration, and respectability on the world stage‚Äîother nations actually took us seriously.

4. **There needs to be a massive sweeping of federal agencies.** Trump‚Äôs treatment from them has given him the perfect reason that they are weaponized political batons that need to go. After what‚Äôs happened to him, he would now do that.

For those that say Independents overwhelmingly dislike Trump, my response is this: where do you think they get their news, their worldviews from? The entirety of left-wing media is dead set against him, and they control a vast supermajority of the media in totality. The media will make ANY nomination into the next Trump, DeSantis included (and they already are with him!). So voting for DeSantis is placing one ‚Äòmedia punching bag‚Äô with another. IT MAKES NO SENSE."
"My only concern with DeSantis is he is moving back towards the old Republican mode where democrats say something / do something and no one fights back - kind of like what Romney did during that debate with Obama and Crowley knowingly pushed a false narrative to help Obama, only to later ""correct"" it when the debate was over."
Desantis is now backed by the Bush wing of the party. That's a huge red flag.
Because he is
Why not both? A Trump DeSantis ticket would be powerful.
A Republican presidential candidate can lose the popular vote by a huge margin nationally only by losing California.  Trump lost the popular vote in California alone by 5 million votes.  Trump lost the popular vote nationally by about 7 million votes.
It‚Äôs a very strange dynamic.  All of the attacks from the left some of which are fair and some not have created this situation where it seems Republicans reflexively support Trump.  This most recent story.  Republicans are rallying behind his paying off a porn star for having sex with her while his wife was home with their young child.  I get that this shouldn‚Äôt be a crime though why does being charged for it help Trump in the polls?  Would we not prefer someone without these sorts of moral issues?
"Y‚Äôall still in here pretending it matters who we run? As if we won‚Äôt just have another ‚Äúsafest and securest election of all time with no irregularities at all‚Äù? Dems will do their thing and it won‚Äôt matter if Trump or Desantis pulled in 100 million votes, Biden or whoever will magically get 110."
I'm not convinced that Biden had 81 million legit votes.
"DeSantis supporters are putting on such a petulant show, complete with DNC talking points, that I'm becoming reluctant to vote for DeSantis even if Trump isn't in the picture. They are definitely staining his brand."
"Well, judging by Trump's track record, he got done what he said he would get done."
A certain presidential candidate got rid of everything that linked him to homosexuality and that is something you can even compare to stormie. Another presidential candidate always cuts her loose ends to this day and you can‚Äôt compare it to anything Trump has done. He is a saint compared to the majority of current or former politicians.
Exactly this. Not to mention that ever since 2008 it seems like the general election has become a popularity contest as opposed to people actually voting on the candidates' policies. Trump is just too unlikable. I prefer both over Biden but lean more to DeSantis cuz I think he has the better shot of winning.
Well said.
"My stance exactly, thanks for sharing."
That sums it up pretty much exactly.
Well said. I 100% concur with this assessment
Bullshit on the Left and Right*
"I'd also point out that the ""Biden Coalition"" is 100% anti-Trump. As in it stands for nothing else. Remove Trump from the equation and his campaign is done for. I could actually see if Trump lost the primary or step down that Biden would suddenly disappear as the candidate. 

Biden spent the 2020 election hiding in a basement the entire time and won. Democrats would have elected a rock instead of Trump if that was their alternative. It's a movement based on hate. And yes, they can generate hate about any candidate (DeSantis would be next and is already under fire). But the moderates also hate Trump. I know countless apolitical types in the 2020 election that never voted and only voted so they wouldn't have to hear about Trump anymore."
"Agreed. But I'm a Virginian and so I figure the GOP nominee will be a done deal by the time I get to cast a primary ballot. So I don't argue about Trump vs. DeSantis. It's pointless. Waaaaaay above my pay grade.

I was really pissed about that in 2008. McCain. Barf."
"As others have pointed out, you‚Äôve read my mind and thoughts to a T."
One of the things I've heard said on a radio show I listen too. He said something that makes a ton of sense to me. He explained that if Trump were to also win the primary. That people that normally don't ever vote. Will vote once again. Because the hatred for Trump. I believe this to be true.
"I still maintain Trump would make a far better Secretary of State under DeSantis, but his ego wouldn't let him take the step down."

The baggage is the most important part. It's specifically because of the baggage that it has to be Trump.

">Trump has made an emotional connection to people who feel the political class has betrayed them for generations

I can't agree more"
"Unfortunately,  Trump has also alienated as many voters as he has connected with. It doesn't matter how good his policies were and how well the country was doing, many people were turned off by his bravado and name calling. Negative emotions are just as powerful as the emotional connections he created."
Add the recent shenanigans in New York. People are pissed. I think this is heating up to be a crazy primary. Followed by a nasty presidential run.
"They aren‚Äôt wrong. Trump, for all his faults, was (and is) unafraid to say something politically incorrect. A LOT of people like someone who doesn‚Äôt do ambiguous ‚Äúlawyer speak‚Äù when asked a question. Conservative candidates can use these tactics‚ÄîESPECIALLY when they have factual high ground. Speaking plainly scores big points."
"Exactly, any person who prefers Trump over DeSantis is not thinking about who can actually win an election, they are just dooming Republican candidates for the sake of their ideological conviction. They would rather see Dems in the White House for the next 40 years than support a more establishment candidate.

The fact is, a plurality in the US still identify as moderate and independents, and at this point in time, that group hates Trump, even more than they hate extreme liberalism, and they always will. The winner of the next election will be the candidate that is seen as less extreme, and that will not be Trump."
"Does balancing the budget include significant tax increases? It‚Äôs hasn‚Äôt been done without some tax increases..ever. 

I don‚Äôt think many of my fellow Republicans give a damn about a balanced budget, all they want is to cut spending where it doesn‚Äôt touch their billions in sacred cows."
"What, you want it delivered by a non-Ivy League communications team? Would that make you happier? Ok, bro. I‚Äôll try not to take it personally. :("
"They said that after the 2000 election. Then Bush won the popular vote in 2004. Blacks and Latino voters came out in bigger numbers for Republicans in the last 2 elections, showing a very dangerous trend for Democrats.

What changed to make it so Democrats still won? White women swung hard against Trump, hating him. Anti-Trump. 

If the GOP can stabilize those demographics a popular vote is fairly easy for a Republican. Even with mass mail in ballots in California padding the numbers. California Republicans also hated Trump. Polling in 2016 showed that even though Trump had the band wagon effect going, had the California primary still made a difference the state was going to overwhelming vote for Cruz to stop a Trump candidate. My brother in California (big conservative for his entire life) voted Independent in 2016/2020 as he would not vote for Trump."
"I think it‚Äôs possible but it‚Äôll take two things:

1. A Republican nominee not named Trump.

2. A Democratic nominee that is extremely awful (like, Maxine Waters level of awful‚Äîmaybe Kamala or an 82-year-old Biden fits the bill, I don‚Äôt know).

If Ted Cruz was the nominee in 2016 instead of Trump, he probably wins the popular vote. More than 5.5% of voters went third party that year."
"Trump has near zero odds in AZ and GA and very low odds in NC and NH. 

I also think MI and PA have completely turned on Trumpism. I mean PA literally elected brain dead socialist rather than the Trumpy candidate."
"DeSantis will bring in independents and Trump voters will vote for DeSantis over Biden anyway. Many swing voters refused to vote for trump because he is morally repugnant and not based on any policy issue. 


The funny part is talking with swing voters most had little to no idea Biden was a pedophile that sexually abused his daughter, that he used the secret service to cover for his sons crime, and the level of corruption the Biden crime family has committed. 


They watch CNN and to the best of their knowledge Biden is a respectable elder statesman and Trump is a dirty angry old man that bangs prostitutes and abuses women (which he is)."
"This is the one pro-Trump argument I‚Äôve heard before and I‚Äôm willing to listen to, but I‚Äôm still not so sure I agree with it.

What‚Äôs to say DeSantis wouldn‚Äôt do well in any of the northern Rust Belt states? I get that the data with blue collar workers is minimal but Trump attracts a *ton* of anti-voters and did abysmally with suburban women; I think DeSantis should objectively do better in both categories. DeSantis also did so well in his re-election in Florida (won Miami-Dade by 11 points and Southeast Florida outright) that one has to think he can attract *some* moderate voters that Trump wouldn‚Äôt.

Also, isn‚Äôt Trump anti-woke, too? Dude literally said ‚Äúeverything woke turns to shit.‚Äù"
"You‚Äôre forgetting arguably the biggest part of the equation: anti-votes.

Yes, Trump had the most votes ever for a Republican. He also had the most people vote *against* him than any other candidate ever. You think all,
or even most, of the 81 million people who voted for Biden did so because they liked Biden? Not a chance.

It‚Äôs debatable if DeSantis would get 74 million votes in a general election. But I can guarantee one thing: if DeSantis or basically anyone not named Trump is the Republican nominee, Biden sure as hell wouldn‚Äôt get 81 million votes again."
"Well, there are two problems with this. It's not how many votes you get, it's how many votes you get relative to the other guy.

No Republican has gotten 74 million votes, but no Republican has had an opponent getting 81 million votes either.\*

If Trump's 74 million votes makes him more popular than Obama, then Biden's 81 million votes makes him more popular than Obama too, and there's just no way in hell he is. Can't compare Reagan to Trump either because in the 1980s the US population was 68% what it was in 2020 -- adjusted for population, Reagan got the equivalent of 76-78 million votes in 1984.

\* I don't want to get into the whole ""election rigging"" discussion because assuming that it was rigged does us no favors; even if it was, what's the alternative? Stay home and not vote?

And also assuming 2020 was rigged, then let's use 2016 as the example where Trump won -- Clinton got 65 million votes to Trump's 62 million even though Trump won more states; does that mean Clinton was as popular as Obama in 2012? I really don't think so."
"IDK, I know many people that went to vote that are casually political vote for the first time, specifically against Trump. I think Trump's issue is that he is specifically a Pop culture icon. In the realm of pop culture, the left has so much strength. So if you have someone so much in pop culture, they can garner a movement against him. It became a cool thing to flip off Trump Tower, or vote specifically against Trump because it was a cultural thing."
"Yep. Primaries are a means to an end. If your nominee cannot win the general, then the primary has not served its purpose and we all might as well sit out and to continue the metaphor being thrown around in recent days, put a ham sandwich forward and save on billions of dollars in election funds that would be otherwise wasted. 

It doesn‚Äôt matter if Trump is voted in by 90% of the Republicans if he can‚Äôt get control of the White House and get any meaningful legislation passed. This isn‚Äôt an opportunity to say ‚Äúoh well I like Trump so much it doesn‚Äôt matter if he loses‚Äù but should really serve as a reflection point as to why the Republican Party preferred candidate is anathema to the rest of the country."
"I used to judge both of them based on their policies. What I realize now that is that more than a strategic policy maker, we need a conservative warrior. This is obvious from the Trump indictment. Trump is the original warrior and he gives zero fucks for the establishment. For example, he started his election campaign at Waco. lol. He is the ideological leader of the conservatives and I prefer him over anyone else."
"Democrats will hate whatever candidate we put forward. But they have already won the narrative game against Trump. Moderates by and large hate Trump and went out to vote to ensure he wouldn't be president again. He also has the Establishment GOP hating him, allowing him to hang out to dry while Democrats lied and cheated via impeachments and January 6th. He also has the DC bureaucracy that hates him with a passion, and are going out of their way to sabotage him every chance they can. Even the brass in the DoD turned against him as he scared them about pulling out of NATO, so they want him gone.

You have every elite institution and entity stacked against him. Pfizer literally sat on their vaccine until after the election to help ensure Trump would lose. You couldn't be anymore obvious that there was a cross the board effort from Social media companies to the FBI that they were willing to do just about anything to see him not be president.

If that type of vitriolic reaction is going to happen for every GOP president going forward, yes we are truly screwed. But I think Trump kicked the hornet's nest a bit more than you are giving him credit for. And as it stands, the powers that be are not going to allow him to win again. Yes that is screwed up, but that is the reality of the situation. He has united numerous power factions to oppose him. He was also incredibly ineffective at fighting them."
"I don't get too worried about them attacking each other in primaries anymore. Kamala called Biden a rapist in the primary and then she ended up VP lol.  

It's all theater anyways"
"Have you seen a single press conference with DeSantis? He handles the media just fine. Sometimes even better than Trump does.

Trump usually just says ‚Äúno no wrong wrong you‚Äôre wrong. Next question.‚Äù

DeSantis usually says ‚Äúno you‚Äôre wrong. And here‚Äôs WHY you‚Äôre wrong. And here‚Äôs why you‚Äôre going to BE wrong when you report on it tonight.‚Äù

This distinction alone makes DeSantis a way more attractive candidate to me. We badly need a Republican who has a spine with the media but also knows how to properly maintain that spine."
"DeSantis has not ignored the media. He just doesn't rant about it and name call. Just a few weeks ago he announced he would no longer do interviews with a major network because they out and out lied about his stance on a particular issue. The networked rolled out a half ass apology for their slander, but didn't fully correct themselves.

Trump was successful at tanking trust in MSM. Their polling is nearly as bad as congress due to his war with them. The trick is rising above that to the point it is clear the GOP candidate is above their mudslinging. Call them out for the slander while being presidential. This will appeal to moderates who very much care about appearances."
"> I don't believe any Republican can handle the national media aside from Trump

It's more than that. Anyone who runs from this point on, better have tens of millions for all the lawsuits the democrats will toss at them. We're talking dozens of concurrent lawsuits AND democrats will pressure any good law firm from representing him, so they get garbage representation. 

I like that Desantis isn't someone who got wealthy while in public office, but that also seems to be a gaping hole in his defenses."
"Florida was very strict on election integrity. Do you know why Miami flipped red in the past election cycle why is that? Because Florida has strict laws on voter ID, they have an election police force which arrests people for committing voter fraud so they have very strict penalties for voter fraud. That's why. Every Republican trifecta state needs to enact those same laws."
"Bush did it in 2004. That‚Äôs the only time since 1988 it‚Äôs happened though.

The Democrat is basically a shoe-in to win California and New York by a combined 7 million plus votes even if they run a half-eaten slice of bologna as the nominee, so I agree it‚Äôll be a long while before a Republican wins the popular vote again. Fortunately it‚Äôs clearly not needed to win an election though."
"Yes, it‚Äôs not about their popularity in Florida or even nationally, it‚Äôs about their popularity in Georgia, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan."
"DeSantis didn‚Äôt just get re-elected in Florida. He won re-election by 19 points against a candidate that was only 1 point away from the Governor‚Äôs mansion 8 years prior.

He won Miami-Dade county by 11 points and won Southeast Florida (Miami-Dade + Broward + Palm Beach) outright, which is bonkers for a Republican. Southeast Florida is usually a 20-point D safe zone.

He won Hispanics by 15, and Independents by 8. He got 45% of the moderate vote which is insane for a Republican.

You don‚Äôt do any of that without appealing to *some* moderate voters. Which is the key to winning swing states."
"> time is running out to prove it

The primary season hasn't even started yet. Only people trying to make names for themselves start campaigning this early (Trump being the exception to this rule). These type of arguments of ""running out of time"" are non-sense as in 2016 Scott Walker was the obvious leading candidate at this point in the election cycle. This will not get serious until the summer."
"Attacking the Iraq war just makes him enemies within the Republican Party and in the Establishment in DC. Peoples entire careers were based on that conflict, whether you liked it or not. Taking dumps on the war is a good way to make enemies with no real benefit. 

If you want him to address his position on interventionism. He has stated recently he thinks Ukraine (the current issue) needs to be resolved and peace be brought to the table. Similar enough position to Trump. Which is not in line with the Warhawks in the party that want to use Ukraine to bleed Russia dry."
His turn?  Sounds like the BS thr Clintons spouted
"Forever living in denial about the 2020 election is just going to result in Democratic Party wins in perpetuity.

Why is it hard to accept that Trump was simply unpopular to 55% of America? A night or two of watching the MSM or looking at the top stories on Google should‚Äôve made that obvious. A couple windows with cardboard covers is not proof that anything illegal happened. At most, some rules were bent. But ultimately Trump is just too polarizing to ever win again. 2016 was lightning in a bottle and‚Äîregardless of whether or not it‚Äôs his fault‚Äîhis baggage has only gotten ten times heavier since."
I don‚Äôt like Trump. Personally I think he‚Äôs a prick and absolutely do not want him as President. But I support the Conservative Party more than I despise him. The problem is that I cannot see a correct route that Trump can take that will equal winning in 2024. The guy produces way too many anti-votes regardless of how they won in 2020.
"Interesting, thanks for sharing"
"Okay let‚Äôs say 2020 was stolen. Why wouldn‚Äôt they just steal it from Trump again in 2024 then? Why would you just re-run the same matchup?

Trump isn‚Äôt gonna fight the deep state he literally appointed the FBI director Wray who has been a disaster. Trump had 4 years and the deep state got the better of him the whole time, he couldn‚Äôt even fight back against Mueller. DeSantis wasn‚Äôt in the senate either. You have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about lol"
Do you dislike Desantis or just like trump more?
">Biden got 81 million votes

#HA!"
I think you can go back a bit further than 2008 to find elections like that heh. JFK would be another example
You haven't been around politics that long if you think this ends with Trump. The insane Left will demonize anyone who calls themselves a conservative. Trump was just the last and best attempt we've seen the Left try to silence for political reasons
"> It's a movement based on hate.

...and election fraud. Nobody - esp. the media - will ever convince me differently."
"> I know countless apolitical types in the 2020 election that never voted and only voted so they wouldn't have to hear about Trump anymore.

And how‚Äôs that going for them? More than 2 years later and Trump‚Äôs name is still superglued to 5 times as many headlines as Biden."
"It‚Äôs still important to talk about it. The more Iowans and South Carolinians who understand, the better."
And he's made the same emotional connection to all the people who HATE him and will do everything in their power to make sure he is unelectable. That's exactly the crux of the issue.
"It takes significant cuts. More specifically it would take entitlement reform. Which seems to be a sacred cow that not even Republicans will touch. Any conservative that talks about a balanced budget has to admit the Mandatory Spending would need to be throttled. They would also have to admit that the majority of the electorate will throw a hissy fit about it and Democrats will run ads of them pushing Grandma's off cliffs.

I'm sorry to break it to conservatives that think the deficit is the most important issue. Americans by and large don't care and will react negatively to any serious effort to address it. There isn't enough responsibility among the general population and you can see it among our culture (most Americans live way outside their means).

Tax increases do not fix it. Laffer curve and global economy. People are tapped out, there is no excess money floating around and our economy is almost in a stagflation. You increase taxes, you watch as economic growth stops completely or goes in reverse, and revenue streams from the government also go in reverse."
The Bush tax cuts effectively got there by 2005/2006/2007 when the deficit was so low it was effectively zero.
"lol!.  My first thought was ""What's this guy's problem?"".  Then I saw your name.  Touche."
"Just like 2020 was an outlier of a year for politics due to Covid, 2004 was an outlier of an election because of what happened on September 11th, 2001 in New York. The U.S. was still a fairly united country at that time. So, it is absolutely no surprise that the President at that time would receive the popular vote.

As someone who did vote for Bush at the time, today I certainly regret how blindly I was in casting my vote for him. I am sure he was better than John Kerry, but not by much."
"No...they came out for Trump...not the GOP.  Most people think of the GOP as a party full of McConnell's and Lindsey Grahams...and they're not wrong. 

Trump is an outsider, just like journalist Matt Taibbi.  He showed them for the corrupt people they really are and now they want to shut him down along with people like Taibbi (a liberal), Bari Weiss, Lee Fang, and authors Michael Shellenberger, David Zweig and Alex Berenson.  The establishment in Washington doesn't like the boat being rocked, and the defense contractor lobbyists along with Wall Street are the ones calling the shots and they hated Trump because he was a wild card.  

&#x200B;

I'm for Trump again, I was on the fence and like DeSantis and will vote for him if Trump is out.  DeSantis has his own issues that will come out soon enough and I don't think he's a real outsider."
"I think that‚Äôs overstating it. He lost AZ and GA by 12,000 votes or 0.2-0.3% in 2020, they were razor tight, I don‚Äôt see how that means ‚Äúnear 0 odds‚Äù. Those states are drifting left and will be a challenge, but definitely not impossible. NH is def out of the picture, but he won NC by 75k votes in 2020, and his candidate won NC in the midterms too

The Midwest is interesting. Republicans COLLAPSED in the midterms in 2022 (and 2018) in the Midwest, and largely in the rural areas which just didn‚Äôt turn out. If you look at a county-level swing map, even a super trumpy candidate like Doug Mastriano who was a disaster and sucked did far worse relative to trump in the rurals rather than the suburbs surprisingly enough. The argument here from Trump people would be that his base are WWC rural voters who only show up in presidential years, that a ton of these voters ONLY show up when trump‚Äôs name is on the top of the ticket basically."
I agree with your entire comment except for NC. I live here. Ted Budd won his Senate election by 120k+ votes against a fairly strong candidate. One of the few 2022 Senate candidates that didn‚Äôt get poisoned by Trump‚Äôs endorsement.
"Yep. Biden's political coalition is based around anti-Trump. They need Trump in order for them to be relevant and to get votes. If Trump is not there, then Biden's political coalition is dead."
"> You think all, or even most, of the 81 million people who voted for Biden 

If you think 81 million people voted Biden on their ticket then I have a bridge to sell you"
"No they don't.  And most think this with-hunt in NY is disgusting.

https://www.politico.com/news/2023/03/31/donald-trump-indictment-00090001#:\~:text=Similarly%2C%20in%20the%20pre%2Dindictment,%E2%80%9Cnot%20serious%20at%20all.%E2%80%9D

More than 6 in 10 Americans (62 percent) think the Manhattan District Attorney's case involving former President Donald Trump is mainly motivated by politics, while 32 percent think the case is mainly motivated by the law.  
  
Republicans (93 - 5 percent) and independents (70 - 26 percent) think the Manhattan District Attorney's case is mainly motivated by politics, while Democrats (66 - 29 percent) think the case is mainly motivated by the law."
"It‚Äôs not just about press conferences.  It‚Äôs the endless accusations, bogus investigations, frivolous lawsuits, and fake news stories that will really test one‚Äôs resolve. Most people could not handle what Trump has been subjected to and I‚Äôm not sure DeSantis (or anyone else in the GOP field) could either.  

And don‚Äôt think they won‚Äôt try what they did to Trump on DeSantis - look at what they put Judge Kavanaugh through.  All it takes is a few people willing to make false accusations to create a huge manufactured scandal."
I'm not saying he doesn't handle the media fine; I'm just saying he doesn't handle them very often. Also nuanced points aren't going to go very far vs them because they will just invent the next story. Attacking their credibility is the best route. He does go down that route but Trump is a master at it.
"This is 100% correct, sadly.  Anyone serious about reforming the system will need a massive war chest  and a rock-solid support base to survive the onslaught of media slander and bogus lawsuits that will be thrown at them.  Trump has this - DeSantis doesn‚Äôt (at least not yet)."
Hardly
">Why is it hard to accept that Trump was simply unpopular to 55% of America?

With the press he got, it's not surprising. Ask those 55% *why* they didn't like Trump."
"Denial is a river in Egypt. I deal in  truth. If you have some facts,  explain Zuckerbucks to me and how that did not fundamentally change the results."
"Oh my gosh, you got me  -  he was in Congress. Saying Senate invalidates everything. LMFAO"
"I‚Äôm skeptical of DeSantis.  He seems decent on the surface, but I doubt that will continue if he became president.  His voting record supports that, and he will likely be beholden to the same bad influences as people like Mitch McConnell and company.

Trump is very far from perfect, but he is also the best president of my lifetime beyond early childhood when I wasn‚Äôt really aware of politics."
"If you‚Äôre saying the 81 million weren‚Äôt perfectly legitimate I‚Äôm totally open to the concept. But if that‚Äôs true and now they‚Äôve doubled down on the procedure then it‚Äôs totally hopeless. I mean, what are you going to do next time, vote harder? If the vote was stolen in 2020 then the Republican establishment is complicit and McConnell would rather lose all Republican elections than to let outsiders win. 

Florida gave us the roadmap to victory. Play by their strategy and win big because we do have the numbers. But saying it‚Äôs hopeless discourages people from participating and they win. Like the 2 million registered republicans in Georgia who let Walker lose by 38,000 votes."
"No, Trump isn't ""just the latest"". The movement of moderates against him his unprecedented. Trump lost the narrative battle against the propaganda of the left. He isn't winning that back no matter how much you want him to."
"Yes the left will try to demonize any conservative candidate. *But* it doesn't have to as easy as it is with Trump.  Yeah they've been smearing DeSantis for a while, but it appears to be far less effective."
"They did cheat, but not in the way you think. The obsession over fraudulent ballots made the vast majority of the Trump base miss what actually happened."
"They are apolitical, they are whining about gas prices and inflation and are confused on why it's so bad. They catch the occasional headline from the leftist MSM."
">And he's made the same emotional connection to all the people who HATE him and will do everything in their power to make sure he is unelectable.

The media? You're naive if you think *any other republican nominee would be treated any differently.*"
"Laffer‚Äôs curve states only that at some point higher taxes leads to reduced tax revenue. It does not state all tax cuts leads to sustained higher tax revenues 

We should be using this period of inflation to both cut spending and increase taxes while maintaining low interest rates and reducing our debt growth. (Nothing will explode the deficit like higher interest rates on refinancing outstanding debt and mandatory inflation increases in Social security and other programs.)

Every one wants to use stimulus in the form of tax cuts or more government spending in a recessionary environment, but no one wants to do the opposite when the economy needs to slow down due to inflationary pressures. They let the Fed do the dirty work because the Fed doesn‚Äôt have to run for reelection.

Taxes equal to the dividend  tax on stock buybacks and large mergers and acquisitions would be a place to start, but there are many areas where tax policy can actually benefit the overall economy by driving new investments."
Elections are always about lesser evils. Bush ran on being a moderate pro-business president. He didn't plan for 9/11 and was manipulated by Cheney and neo-conservatives to do what he did. After 2004 he obsessed about his legacy and realized he had been manipulated and went in complete reverse which tanked the Republican brand completely.
How did Trumpism do in those states in 2022?
"Ted Budd wasn't super 'Trumpy' though.  He was more so a normal mainstream republican who was also endorsed by Trump.

NC to me is similar to GA, but just a few years behind."
Yes most people think the DA is doing a political prosecution. That does not translate into people wanting Trump as president. While this recent witch hunt had increased support among the Republican base for Trump. It isn't moving moderates or Democrats towards him at all.
"""Don't say gay"" was a national campaign against DeSantis. He lost no support within Florida even though he had Disney and every other left wing major player coming after him with hatchets and lying about the law.

That's a fairly good indication he can weather the fire."
"Narrative control is strongly against Republicans. 2016 we were able to get around the Great Filter using social media. Democrats shored that up with their Russian Interference BS, and Social Media is now apart of the great filter (besides Twitter). 

Whoever our candidate is in 2024, they will need to have a strategy specifically to get through the filter the left has constructed that keeps the general population from hearing conservative narratives."
">If the vote was stolen in 2020 then the Republican establishment is complicit and McConnell would rather lose all Republican elections than to let outsiders win. 

Sadly, that's not outside the realm of possibility.

> Like the 2 million registered republicans in Georgia who let Walker lose by 38,000 votes. 

Which is weird; he's a state treasure."
Because Trump is his own worst enemy.
"It's not the media, it's the people. Trump gives the media ammo in the form of crass comments, mean tweets, and  ill-advised off the cuff remarks. The media reports it with spin, then people hear it and hate Trump on an emotional level. I do not think DeSantis will make the same mistakes. While the media does try to spin DeSantis in the way they do with Trump, it will be (and so far is) less effective. The media did the same with previous republican candidates, but no one has driven out the hate vote more than Trump."
"You‚Äôre not wrong, but Trump was something different. You had tens of millions of people who didn‚Äôt even care about politics dreaming, sleeping, and living 24/7 about beating Trump. You‚Äôre not going to get to that same level of hate with DeSantis in just 1.5 years. There will be *some* hatred, yes. That I (and all DeSantis supporters, I can assure you) are very well-aware of that. The point is it takes years of widespread national attention to get to the level of anti-voters Trump achieved."
"Laffer curve suggests that as you approach 100% taxation that revenue goes to 0. That each increase in taxes has diminishing returns, where there comes a point where you go over the bell curve and start heading back down again.

Our economy is on the brink. And between regulations, taxation, inflation, etc there is no way increases in taxes will result in more revenue. There might be a spike for 6 months then a sudden collapse.

>We should be using this period of inflation to both cut spending and increase taxes while maintaining low interest rates and reducing our debt growth. (Nothing will explode the deficit like higher interest rates on refinancing outstanding debt and mandatory inflation increases in Social security and other programs.)

You want to reduce interest rates with inflation going out of control? You typically want to do your type of measures doing good economic times. At least the Keynesians claimed that.

I don't see tax increases as ever a solution. You would need to get the states to reduce their taxes and get other economic impacts under control or you're looking at a full blown recession bordering on a depression."
Did you read my comment?
Neither was Oz or Laxalt but they both blew what should‚Äôve been easy races.
"Thank you so, so much for calling it what it was: a **lie**.

So many Redditors were crying ‚Äúwhy is authoritarian fascist DeSantis in a conflict with Disney over a political opinion! They‚Äôre allowed to have an opinion! üò≠üò≠üò≠‚Äù when it wasn‚Äôt simply an opinion. It was a lie. Completely false. Anyone who read the 4-page bill knows that there is *nothing* restrictive against LGBT+ rights. At all. 

Disney didn‚Äôt say the little tree was too big. They said the sky was purple. There‚Äôs a massive difference."
">You had tens of millions of people who didn‚Äôt even care about politics dreaming, sleeping, and living 24/7 about beating Trump

Only because of democrat controlled media. They'd been told to hate him since the escalator... Even though he was previously a media darling.

If you think that same machine wouldn't turn on anyone else, you're living a fantasy."
"Our economy has been on the brink in every decade for the past 240 years. Some tax avoidance schemes (like the previously mentioned mergers and stock buybacks) increase  individual or corporate wealth without increasing investment into the economy. It is overly simplistic to be dogmatic to say all tax reform that increases certain tax levels is bad and all spending is bad. 

When taxation laws allow corporations and individuals have a unnatural focus on tax avoidance vs wealth or sales/ income growth then the laws allowing the avoidance needs to be addressed. 

Carl Icahn has a video floating around about how he bought a poor performing railroad company because it had a decade of losses to carry forward to reduce his conglomerates total tax debt. Bad policy driving economic decisions needs to be addressed."
"No where do you address GA and AZ in 2022. 

Also, election after election election in 2022 showed that normal republicans won and Trumpy wins lost or significantly under performed.  Mike Dewine as about as generic Republican that you can find and he pulled Vance across the finish line in the Senate Race."
"Oz was 100% Trumpy.

Laxalt was facing an fairly popular incumbent which is what sunk him."
"You're not understanding. Trump ALREADY has almost a decade of hate built up around his name. It's not a matter of the fact that the media will pull the same shit, it's that Trump ALREADY has significant momentum going in the wrong direction."
"Vance won by a large 6% bro he wasn‚Äôt dragged lol. Ohio is a safe R state by now, that race was never in doubt

AZ in 2022 had the super trumpy Kari Lake who was awful in many regards lose by only 17,000 votes. Masters got fucked though by a good well funded incumbent. In GA Kemp easily won but the trumpy candidate Herschel Walker who could barely speak only lost by 40k votes or 1% in the main election (runoff was worse). In NV Republicans actually won the governor and lost the senate seat, both very narrowly 

Again, I‚Äôm not claiming personally that Trump is the best option or will win all of these states. I‚Äôm just being reasonable enough to understand that narrowly losing states by >1% or tens or thousands of votes doesn‚Äôt mean that the states are lost forever and trump has 0% chance of winning them. And Republicans for the past like decade or two have a terrible track record in the rust belt usually not even being close except for 2016 and 2020, Trump seems to have some sort of appeal there when he‚Äôs on the ballot that drives out working class rurals.

And also again, there‚Äôs a difference between trumpism and trump. In 2022 we saw candidates who were not Trump face all the downsides of him without the upside of juiced rural numbers. The pro-Trump idea is that 2016 and 2020 show that when Trump himself is on the ballot it goes much better than weak midterms in 2018 and 2022"
Oz was absolutely not Trumpy lol. This sub complained for months about how he‚Äôs a RINO. Dude had a history of supporting gender transition for children below the age of consent.
You're not understanding. DeSantis will have just as much hate ginned up against him by election day.
">Vance won by a large 6% bro he wasn‚Äôt dragged lol. Ohio is a safe R state by now, that race was never in doubt

How did Dewine do? In pretty much every single election the Trump candidate underperformed normal republicans.

>AZ in 2022 had the super trumpy Kari Lake who was awful in many regards lose by only 17,000 votes. Masters got fucked though by a good well funded incumbent. In GA Kemp easily won but the trumpy candidate Herschel Walker who could barely speak only lost by 40k votes or 1% in the main election (runoff was worse). In NV Republicans actually won the governor and lost the senate seat, both very narrowly

All of this happening in the best mid-term environment for the GOP since 1994.  Those loses should have been lay-up victories.  Not close loses.

>Again, I‚Äôm not claiming personally that Trump is the best option or will win all of these states. I‚Äôm just being reasonable enough to understand that narrowly losing states by >1% or tens or thousands of votes doesn‚Äôt mean that the states are lost forever and trump has 0% chance of winning them

They are not lost for forever.  However, we have 3 straight elections of them rejecting Trumpism, and when available accepting/embracing normal Republicans.

>And Republicans for the past like decade or two have a terrible track record in the rust belt usually not even being close except for 2016 and 2020, Trump seems to have some sort of appeal there when he‚Äôs on the ballot that drives out working class rurals.

Bush did pretty good. Trump has also cost the GOP the suburbs which will hurt long term in the growing areas of the country.  Trading for states that are losing population for growing states is not a good long term bet.

>And also again, there‚Äôs a difference between trumpism and trump. In 2022 we saw candidates who were not Trump face all the downsides of him without the upside of juiced rural numbers. The pro-Trump idea is that 2016 and 2020 show that when Trump himself is on the ballot it goes much better than weak midterms in 2018 and 2022

If that is the case, then why did we win the house in 2022 but not 2020?  Election after election since 2016 shows that Trump does more for Democrats than he does for the GOP."
"especially after years of economics recession, wars, IRS Gestapo agents, witch-hunts and more coming to light about how the Biden administration is actively spying on people and censoring them.

&#x200B;

Trump had a great economy, no wars, low cost of living and even with COVID still managed well despite having an  entire branch of government, the mainstream media and deep-state actively conspiring against him the WHOLE presidency."
"Trump is also a RINO.

Oz is a rich former TV star who continually flip flopped on previous policy views and came off like a snake oil salesman.  It doesn't get much more trumpy than that."
That's speculation. Trump is a known quantity. Desantis MIGHT have a chance.
"\>How did Dewine do? In pretty much every single election the Trump candidate underperformed normal republicans

Dewine did great but governors races are much less polarized than senate races, way more prone to blowouts. And again, who cares how much you win by if it's already a safe seat. DeWine was a disastrous governor on COVID, I much prefer a very conservative candidate like Vance to win by 6% in a Republican seat than a moderate win by a landslide in a seat that Republicans were always gonna win anyway. A win is a win, and 6% is more than a comfortable enough margin anyway, you don't gain much of anything by going past that. Vance was also running against a great Dem candidate in Tim Ryan, DeWine ran against nobody it wasn't a real campaign.

\>All of this happening in the best mid-term environment for the GOP since 1994. Those loses should have been lay-up victories. Not close loses.  
\>They are not lost for forever. However, we have 3 straight elections of them rejecting Trumpism, and when available accepting/embracing normal Republicans.  


I don't disagree, again I'm a DeSantis guy lmao. I'm just saying it's definitely very possible for Trump to win those states that he narrowly lost by, it's not an impossible task. In your original comment you said he basically had 0 chance in these states which I disagree with. I don't think he's the best option but I also don't think a 10,000-20,000 vote loss in some of these key states is impossible to flip.

\>Bush did pretty good. Trump has also cost the GOP the suburbs which will hurt long term in the growing areas of the country.  
Suburbs have been shifting democrat long before Trump, he definitely accelerated the trend but you can't pull Bush/Romney suburb margins when the suburns today are significantly less white and more college educated, two demographics that heavily favor dems. Look at the Atlanta or Virginia suburbs for example, Kemp/Youngkin's #s there despite being excellent candidates were still worse than the Bush days.

Also for Bush and the original question, despite winning 2 elections he never one one of those PA/WI/MI rust belt states which Republicans need in 2024 given how the map has shifted. He came very close in WI tbf, but again Trump is the first Republican since HW in 1988 to win any of those 3 states.  


\>If that is the case, then why did we win the house in 2022 but not 2020? Election after election since 2016 shows that Trump does more for Democrats than he does for the GOP.  
Again, I was talking about the Midwest in that comment, the white working class rural areas that are Trump's base. If you just look at the Midwest in 2018 and 2022, the House and Senate races are complete disasters because the rural voters simply didn't show up. And that'll be the question for DeSantis, can he turn out those low-propensity voters that Republicans need to win those states?"
">Dewine did great but governors races are much less polarized than senate races, way more prone to blowouts. And again, who cares how much you win by if it's already a safe seat. DeWine was a disastrous governor on COVID, I much prefer a very conservative candidate like Vance to win by 6% in a Republican seat than a moderate win by a landslide in a seat that Republicans were always gonna win anyway

I don't think Vance wins without Dewine personally.  Also Vance is more populist than Conservative.

>I'm just saying it's definitely very possible for Trump to win those states that he narrowly lost by, it's not an impossible task. In your original comment you said he basically had 0 chance in these states which I disagree with

2022 gives us more evidence.  The only chance Trump has in those states is a completely collapse of Biden that makes those states meaningless anyways.  

> Suburbs have been shifting democrat long before Trump, he definitely accelerated the trend but you can't pull Bush/Romney suburb margins when the suburns today are significantly less white and more college educated, two demographics that heavily favor dems

Historically college educated was the core GOP Demographic.  The upper middle class bachelors degree family were the most reliable GOP voters.

>Also for Bush and the original question, despite winning 2 elections he never one one of those PA/WI/MI rust belt states which Republicans need in 2024 given how the map has shifted.

They were disasters only in places where Trumpy candidates were nominated.  We walk in AZ for both Governor and Senate if normal people are nominated.  We walk in Georgia if a normal conservative is nominated instead of Walker.  PA should have been a lay-up in the Senate if we didn't nominate the worst possible candidate for both of those races."

That criminal hit a high school volleyball player from out of state that was here for a tournament and she lost her legs.

My view is this is about creating a crisis.  People who are being preyed on constantly and don‚Äôt feel safe will want the government to do something.  Take away some more freedom for protection.  Another chunk of 2A gone. 

But fighting back yourself undermines this.  So they want to discourage people from doing it by prosecuting them.  Even if they don‚Äôt get a conviction, the point is to ruin them one way or another as a warning to anyone else thinking of doing likewise.

The bigger question is why do they need to get rid of the 2A.  The CCP Virus lockdowns in other disarmed Western countries should have given you some idea. 

Beyond that, at some point not too long from now, maybe 1-2 decades, the entitlement and welfare system will collapse in bankruptcy.  Take a look at history for what happens next to the ruling class.  Our rulers already know the answer to that question."

Remember when he said in an interview the time his country was under Nazi occupation, and when he served the Nazis to confiscate property from Jewish citizens, was ‚Äúexhilarating‚Äù and ‚Äúthe happiest time of his life?‚Äù  We took all of that away from him - and maybe this is his revenge."
Or we just build a big containment wall around the place and let them have at it
"> I still have hope that even in NY a jury won‚Äôt be able to find you guilty for self defense,

This assumes it goes before a jury. Too often in our system, abusive prosecutors like this fat scumbag (or practically speak in this case, his subordinates) overcharge (which in this case is bringing any charge) and threaten and intimidate the accused into making plea deals. Since they often cannot afford to fight back, and public defenders are grossly underfunded and overworked (they are just about the only government employees whose jobs should exist and be well funded) compared to prosecutors, their free representation usually prods them into signing said plea."

"Brings up the question for me: Who actually does the initial charging in a case?  I googled, but didn't come up with anything useful.  I though you had to be charged with something to be arrested, which would mean that the police officer would be the one doing the initial charging.  But then I read they only need probable cause to arrest you and then you can be held for some period of time before  you are charged.  One result suggested you get charged in your initial court appearance.  But if you get shot and go to the hospital, seems like you wouldn't be charged for some time or for that matter even arrested.  Anyone actually know how this works?"

As others have stated...I was responding to what was written in the linked story....not simply the headline.  Looks like things have changed.  Just like the DA charged the clerk for murder before dropping the charges from what was most likely a public outcry.
The fact that he was arrested and there was even a consideration of charging him is outrageous. Bragg is scum of the earth
The entire article reads like an opinion piece against Bragg. And here I thought hotair.com was a reputable news source lol

Soros took advantage of this position.  historically a lot of trust was placed in these people.  And it was basically assumed that they were pro law enforcement.

There is some stage between the police making an accusation and a formal charge.  It's actually when the handoff from police to DA occurs.  I don't know what it's called.  Maybe this was interrupted there.

For one, I just have doubts the current house GOP coordinated enough to even accomplish this, or how legally feasible it is. They also have a habit of saying they'll do big things, and then never getting around to the doing them part. This could be pure theater.

Then there's the question - Are right leaning prosecutors going to be comfortable with this? Generally it seems like prosecutors are more politically right or centrist than defenders that tend to be more left leaning. 

Comparing it to the left's strategy against the police, well, how did that go for the left? Might want to think about that one. Hasn't that backfired on them?"
Good. Prosecutors and by extension judges should be completely and utterly impartial. Leave your politics at the door and do your job according to the letter and the spirit of the law.
"Incorrect judgment in a case, like when someone is charged and the DA loses the case in court, it's not the issue. The real issue is malicious prosecution by a DA and abuse of prosecutorial discretion AND not periodically reviewing their track record for abuse and bias.

There is no mechanism to have their decisions reviewed for how they arrived at the decision to charge in the first place and what led up to that.

I believe qualified immunity is necessary.  But I also think people are missing the point of the term. It should be ""qualified.""

In the case of the police, I used to think that qualified immunity should not be taken away because without it, it inhibits the way they go about their job. Without it, it can negatively influence how they do their job. 

But at the same time, qualified immunity needs proper and aggressive oversight because as we've seen many times in recent years, it can easily be abused and it's use can easily be rationalized. This is what has been coming to the surface and we've been finding out recently. There is a great lack of proper oversight that must accompany
qualified immunity for it to be effective.

So now I'm all for, in the name of balanced justice, figuring out in great detail exactly when qualified immunity should not exist or when it should be taken away in cases, even temporarily.  And maybe this is a case-by-case thing until a cop or a DA shows a track record of misuse and bad judgment?  Then I'm all for having it removed 100% for them permanently.

I'm NAL, so I don't have nearly the informational background needed to even begin to solve this problem.  There may also be other possible solutions that I'm completely unaware of like some kind of renewable insurance or bond or accreditation that needs to be put in place when police and DA's are given their authority?

But I also recognize that doing so after the fact could put a lot of cops and DAs in jeopardy for judgment they used. Removal of qualified immunity, even temporarily on individual cases, must be done with lots of advanced notice and training as well."
"Good, end Qualified Immunity all together, it is an abomination created by the Supreme Court that we survived without for over 206 years. After 41 years it can go in the trash were it belongs."
"I watch Steve Lehto on youtube. He often does videos on the absurdity of qualified immunity. To have QA removed, there has to be a similar case where QA was struck out. But you can't have QA struck out if there is no similar case. It is completely bloody bananas."
The supreme court we have is unlikely to go for that proposal.
"Which is why it needs to be done legislatively, they can go kick rocks on this issue for all I care."
Now... if we turned around and increased production to compensate we could spit in their faces and make some fucking money while reducing energy costs at home... but that's too damn smart for the absolute fucking morons we got running this sideshow.
Not surprised. If we utilized our own oil we could pay down the debt and make this country a better country and then use that opportunity to combat ‚Äúclimate change‚Äù or utilize cleaner energy.
">f we turned around and increased production to compensate we could spit in their faces and make some fucking money while reducing energy costs at home

The global oil market is complex, and increasing U.S. oil production might not directly lead to lower energy costs at home. Prices are influenced by numerous factors, including geopolitical events, economic conditions, and technological advances.

Increasing oil production in the U.S. can also have significant environmental consequences that contribute to climate change. Moreover, there are risks associated with oil spills and damage to ecosystems.  Oil spills can lead to increased taxes due to the expenses related to cleanup, environmental restoration, and economic losses. Governments may need to allocate additional funds for cleaning up spills, rehabilitating ecosystems, and compensating affected industries like tourism and fisheries. These expenses can result in increased taxes or shifts in budget priorities."
"Don‚Äôt kid yourself on paying down the debt. Neither party is willing to be fiscally responsible now, not when being irresponsible allows them to line their own pockets."
"Listen... I know how oil prices work, simple supply/demand. I don't need a basic econ course.

And I *don't fucking care* about ""environmental consequences"" when I have to pay through the nose just to drive my car to work.

We had fuel prices, pre-plandemic, below $2/gallon while being a net exporter of crude. We could *easily* do that again... if we had someone at the helm that was actually *voted* into office... not installed as a fucking puppet."
Complete BS.
"What a short sighted view. The world has energy needs. The energy needs will be met somehow. At least when we produce in the US, companies are held to strict environmental regulations that minimize impact to the environment. When that production is done in places that don't have strict environmental regulations instead, the amount of pollution is astronomical comparatively. And saying ""But that doesn't affect us because the pollution is not being generated by us"" is ignorant. If you truly cared about the environment, you'd want the US to increase local regulated production so we decrease the dirty unregulated production being done elsewhere in the world. Something to think about."
except everytime we have significantly increased production prices have gone done.  law of supply and demand.
Yea yea yea.  The climate boogeyman man strikes again!  He's a useful tool facilitating oppression.   Real oppression.   Not the imagined oppression many people victimize themselves for

They have their own little office inside the main office. Once the tardy bell rings, all doors to the school are completely locked. The only way in is a separate door(installed after Columbine), where there is a security camera that goes to the main office, you buzz your way in and go directly to the main office."
If armed guards at the entry to every school is what it takes to ensure the safety of the children inside...so be it.
"Good. 

I went to HS in Detroit in the 90s. Metal detector at the main entrance, armed school cop always there - and, this was at one of the ""good"" schools. You know what didn't happen? People didn't get shot in the school. Random fights (rare, but did happen), yes. But, zero shootings. Still to this day, it doesn't happen."
"We defend our president - with guns.

We defend our Congressmen - with guns.

We defend our Governors - with guns.

We defend our celebrities - with guns.

We defend our sporting events - with guns.

We defend our jewelry stores - with guns.

We defend our banks - with guns.

We defend our office buildings - with guns.

We defend our factories - with guns.

We defend our courts - with guns.

We defend our children with a worthless sign that reads:

""THIS IS A GUN FREE ZONE.""
‚Ä¶AND THEN CALL SOMEONE WITH A GUN IF THERE'S AN EMERGENCY

Remember, all of the political vermin and elites who push for gun control are surrounded by security armed with guns to protect them, paid by your tax dollars. But they want you defenseless."
"Great idea, but locked security doors are also a must.  

People badge in at work every day at the office, it's not an unreasonable thing for kids.  I don't understand why leftist parents don't want their children to enjoy the same security level they themselves have at work.  It's unforgivable, they're monsters who don't deserve children."
Liberals: ‚ÄúNoooo that‚Äôs not what we meant when we said make schools safer!‚Äù
"This worked quite well at Parkland, Columbine, Uvalde‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs theater."
Good!
"Pointless. See Uvalde.  Armed guys wait for shooter to run out of ammo.

Pointless.  Make schools impregnable.  Mass shootings at hospitals become new norm.

Guns are now the number one cause of death for kids in the US.  Number one.  Any sane culture would would use laws to stop the number one one cause of child death."
"Or crazy idea here, maybe less security is better. I never had any of this bullshit growing up. Nobody shot up my schools. No metal detectors, no locked doors, no security , no oversight, no fucking police state in a school which is what these damned schools are. They are mini police states. No wonder we are getting authoritarianism in the USA. Did you know kids now have to wear an ID at all times at school? They get in trouble if they don't have it. I never had an ID. Never needed one either. It's a joke, we're teaching kids that authority should be monitoring them at all times. No wonder they all have anxiety, big brother is always watching"
"Wasn't the school in TN a private school? This will be great for public schools, but private schools need to do the same...

It is also my understanding that the shooter entered through a door that was supposed to be locked, but wasn't.

Implementing greater security measures, armed resource officers is great and the right way to go. Insuring that all policies are followed is critical to the success."
"Went to high school in California, had several security guards on regular patrol (unarmed) and 1 county sheriff assigned to the school (dedicated, not rotational)."
"Shit anymore you gotta have a cop at school at all times just to deal with fights, drugs, theft, etc"
Not a single one of those schools had what is being suggested in the story.
"> Any sane culture would would use laws to stop the number one one cause of child death.

We do, we have speed limits, seatbelt laws, drunk driving laws, high driving laws.

You were talking about the actual number one killer of children being car accidents, right?  Not the study that included young adults in order to make guns the number one killer."
"I get it, for you guns must be a euphemism for abortion, clever!"
"Good idea! And maybe if we get rid of the police, crime will go down! And maybe if we spend more money, inflation will go down!!! /S"
"We had a cop on campus and the ID requirement, but that was about it, the doors weren‚Äôt even locked if I recall correctly.  

Even the ID thing wasn‚Äôt heavily enforced, and mostly used when checking out a book at the library or when going off campus for lunch which you could only do if you were a Senior.  We could leave the ID in our wallet.  It was a decent security measure though, because of gangs they had a few incidents where someone who wasn‚Äôt a student came on campus to sell drugs, or to start a fight with a rival gang member.  The ID ended up stopping this.

The cop was just there.  He wasn‚Äôt even allowed to get involved in situations that fell under school discipline.  He only got involved if there were drugs or weapons, or to help break up a fight.  He was armed, but that‚Äôs because he was a cop."
"Also California, and pretty much the same setup.  The sheriff‚Äôs deputy got to know kids too in order to generate a good relationship with the student body.  He was on campus all day every day from when the first students showed up, to when the sports teams ended practice.  All the high schools in the area had this"
"‚Ä¶ What? The one at Parkland is infamous for doing nothing! The one at Columbine traded shots. And I don‚Äôt think I need to mention the unless at Uvalde.

Uvalde had 40+ armer officers in the building and somehow this was not enough until border patrol arrived.
Nothing you say will ever make a police state more safe. We are overburdened with authority. Don't be so ignorant
They had 40 officers at the school everyday? That had to cost a fortune.
its not called a police state when people have armed guards protecting banks and other places of value eh?
"LOL you cannot be this dense (or can you?)

Let's see buddy. Must ID yourself at all times. All means of egress locked and tightly monitored. Armed guards/security presence. People roaming halls looking for kids? You know what that sounds like? A fucking prison. Enjoy having your kids raised in what amounts to be a prison. It's authoritarian to the core what kids are being subjected to in schools now. Pretty fucking sad a conservative sub can't grasp this. I mean did you really just suggest a bank and guards? That has nothing to do with this at all, a school isn't a bank it's not even comparable."
"Just sayin'...  If President Donald John Trump didn't say another word til after the November 2024 election.  I want him to know I voted for him.  And I'll be certain that my entire family will have done the same.

There is nothing the Left or anyone can alleged will shake me from my support for President Donald John Trump."
I think it's a safe bet he'll say another word.
Worshipping false gods is very cringe-worthy.
Ask Robespierre how the French Revolution turned out.
They don't think that far ahead.
"They're counting on it, and my bet is the supreme court is in the crosshairs. I figured this was just about making sure Trump wins the primary, but that might just be icing on a bigger cake. SCOTUS has been a thorn in the left's side for a long time now, and Trump is the perfect weapon against it. Forcing the conservative supreme court to choose Trump's fate would be absolutely perfect for the dems."

"Hopefully they‚Äôre partying just as hard when the Biden Crime Family has to charter a bus to get them, their lawyers and their relatives over to the courthouse.  Fat Franky, Hunter, Uncle Jimi, ‚ÄúDr.‚Äù Jill, Hallie (The Merry Widow) and the Big Guy himself will all eventually have their day in court!"
Lesley Stahl also balked and rolled her eyes when Trump told her the Dems spied on his campaign‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and it was all true. Her credibility is zero and her opinion means even less.
There is no evidence ???  Maybe check the flight logs on the Lolita express.
"I mean, if you believe children are competent enough to consent to permanently altering their bodies/reproductive abilities, it‚Äôs not exactly a stretch to think that you would also believe they are competent enough to consent to other ‚Äúreproductive‚Äù choices."
"I guess Lesley is not shocked at Democrat Governors creating sanctuaries for underage children to go and have irreversible treatments to change their gender without their parents approval. How about the CRT brainwashing of children to hate they are white, to instill guilt for their supposed racist advantages they were given at birth?  Is she shocked at the Drag Shows displaying Lewd & Lascivious behavior in front of children?   Her raised eyebrows are all show. MGT did not give an inch. She may be extreme at times but it‚Äôs better than traitors like Romney and Mitch."
"Would Lesley have been happy if MTG walked her comments back to the Dems being a party of pedophile enablers? Not every D is a pedo, but at this point every D is a pedo enabler."

"Banning tiktok is 1 thing

Introducing an unconstitutional ""patriot act 2.0"" bill that greatly impeads on freedoms for everyone and can be used to willy nilly ban so many other things and trying to use that to ban tiktok is a whole other thing"
"The issue is the bill to ban tiktok does a lot of heinous shit and then ""oh and restrict tiktok a bit"".

Usual political horseshit."
Just ban data harvesting and collection by tech companies.
That Restrict Act is cancerous
"The Restrict Act is NOT the way to do it.

Take away your kids' phones, delete TikTok from your phone."
Slippery slope guys
"It doesn't matter if the sheep are leaning left or right.

Sheep are still sheep"
"how about introducing a law that outright prohibits any data collection at all of U.S citizens‚Ä¶it‚Äôs an invasion of privacy to begin with..

i‚Äôm not googles,apples or anyone else‚Äôs beta tester or test subject‚Ä¶there‚Äôs absolutely no need to utilize my data,i pay a lot of money for phone service and my personal property (data) is being used for profit and i‚Äôm not receiving any dividends for it‚Ä¶.this is called theft of intellectual property..

i‚Äôm curious if one could copyright their personal data?"
"Same people were in favor of patriot act. Doesn‚Äôt take much to convince Americans to give up their freedoms. 

The real reason is that TikTok is the only mainstream platform where conservatives aren‚Äôt instantly censored for stepping out of line. Due to the way TikTok works it‚Äôs impossible for the ‚Äúfact checkers‚Äù to keep up."
"I support a clean bill to ban companies that illegally sell our data to China.

I don't support the Patriot act 2.0"
Rather have tiktok than the bill they are trying to pass.
The TikTok ban should be a one paragraph bill. But no... the uniparty thought it was a good idea to introduce the patriot act 2.0.
How very small government of them
I would like to ban the people who proposed that bill from the US. Kick them out.
2 to 1? Aren't there like 150million us based tiktok accounts?
"People are being short-sighted about this. I'll admit that I initially fell for it too, but it's become clear that the reason banning TikTok has such bipartisan support in DC is because the American tech cartel wants more pie. The moment TikTok is banned, a US company will create the same exact app with the exact same content. In fact, it'll probably be even more woke."
banning speech is okay if the majority supports it. /s
Here's to hoping the Supreme Court upholds its duty and protects America by upholding the Constitution should this unconstitutional law be passed (heaven forbid). But considering how they haven't taken down the Patriot Act... We can only hope and pray at this point.
The use of any software or tech that can and will be used to gather information on the general population is always suspicious. There is no reason why either of them can be produced safely and securely.
"The gov doesn't care about internet usage/data, this is big tech trying to eliminate a competitor."
I don't like the idea of banning anything outright. Makes sense to ban it for government/military though. Reaching government hands into even more of our lives is never gonna end well.
How is banning TikTok not a 1st amendment issue?
"Banning Tic Tok is reasonable objective, but doing it via the Restrict Act is not.  Another example of the government using something that is reasonable as the justification to the public to enact a far broader and harmful policy."
Only reason tictok came up to band. So they could slip a bill that allows the gov to spy on your phones comps ect. If you used a vpn to block them it would be a million dollar fine and 20 yrs in prison. Look it up. Look that way and they slip in.
"I dont want China spying on us through TikTok, but I also dont want our government to have the power to put us in jail for 20 yrs because we didnt go to an approved website"
"As much as I dislike the CCP, making our govt function more like the CCP is not the answer."
I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs the same percent who are unfamiliar with the 1st Amendment. Probably also the same percent who have no idea what TikTok is.
"RED HERRING. 
that act is worse than the 9/11 act."
I dont like the add ons in the bill ID rather have tik tok then allow any of that. Then again the Chinese use it to ruin us.
Not with sb686
"It's foolish. I don't like TikTok, but if America starts banning social media platforms for reasons of misinformation, political manipulation, or psychological wellbeing, mark my words, that's not going to be where it ends.

Rumble will be next, then maybe Truth, and Locals, and Substack, and ultimately any other platform that doesn't isolate, quarantine, and/or ban alternative viewpoints on sight."
big govt is being a parent and taking our toys away. Government is forcing a parental role when it should be us and our own devices. I'd rather freedom over safety. Keep tiktok if I keep my freedom for christ's sake.
Make sure we read the full bill before we get ourselves excited about a tik.tok ban.
This is the opposite of freedom and Liberty
Why does it need to be banned?
"I would love to see who they actually polled for this, because everyone under 40 that I know loves tik tok."
This poll is bullshit. Half of America uses TikTok. I bet they only interviewed boomers.
Tiktok influencers seething rn
Get rid of tic tok..
"i would LOVE tiktok to be banned, along side most other social media, but this recent bill that was introduced is NOT how it should be done."
"Please do!!!!


Then again, i see a US big tech company buying TikTok"
These numbers don't add up.
"The headline is misleading to the point of being false. **50%** support a TikTok ban, and the other 50% oppose it or aren't sure."
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs realistic tbh. With 150 million active account even if a third of those are people with multiple accounts. That‚Äôs 100 mil people on it. Literally 100% of people who aren‚Äôt using it would have to be against it. Maybe if you polled only people 60+ you might get that number.
"I bet they won't support all the other shit in that bill. Instead of asking them to ban it, we should just uninstall it and block it from our routers."
There are other American companies harvesting data as well. TikTok isn't an outlier.
"If you find yourself agreeing with the majority, then rethink your stance/"
We really need to get the word out on this
"The core issue is the trade war with China.

The ""Great Firewall of China"" blocks Facebook, Twitter, Google, Gmail, YouTube, Netflix, and other US-based services from Chinese consumers.  That's billions of dollars in lost income for these US-based companies.  China wants that revenue and profit flowing to China-based companies.

The US needs to ban all Chinese Internet services until they open that up.  Free trade only makes sense if it's two-way."
"The machiavellian dialectical maneuvering here is just incredible. 

Let our citizens be infected with an open and obvious data mining scam, refuse to do anything about it until everyone is furious and wants it banned, THEN using that hate to secretly pass a bill that takes a way freedom.

Evil, but you gotta give the devil his due."
"I am know fan of TikTok.  Primarily, I think it's algorithm's are deliberate attempts to propagandize Americans  and likely other western countries' citizens into believing harmful lies.

All that said, had I been the CEO of TikTok, I would have walked up to the desk, opened the checkbook, and said, ""All right, we all know this comes down to ""campaign donations"", so how much is it going to take for this to go away?"""
TikTok is a Chinese information steal - try not to buy Chinese made stuff. Buy American
Nobody asked me
"Once Americans get off this party line, and realize that most Americans want the same thing and that they distract us by hating one another then we will get stuff done.   Hear me out.  Whether your right or left the other side ain‚Äôt screwing you. THEY are screwing all of US."
Not when our online privacy is the price we pay.
"You gotta question the 2 to 1 statistic since i
Tic tok is as popular as it is.  Our government would never "" juice the stats"" would they?"
"This shouldn't be a question, it should just be done. The west needs to stop its addiction to Chinese tech."
"Right, the bill doesn't ban TikTok, it hands the executive broad authority over the internet which can be used to ban TikTok (amoung other things)"
"What, you don't want 20 years in prison for using a VPN? What's wrong with you? Boot not heavy enough on your neck?"
"Is the better solution not to force companies to limit, or at least disclose the information they're collecting about you? Require the data to be stored in America, deleted upon your request, and able to be reviewed by you at any time?"
I call it call it the ‚Äú Disappearing Citizens Act.‚Äù
Banning tik tok isn't a good move as it opens the door to more shit.
Shocking everyone has overlooked this. Google/Insta/Tiktok all do the same data harvesting
"This should also be done to counter Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, etc. But the main problem with TikTok is that when they inevitably continue to do it all they get is a slap on the wrist because they're China."
">Just ban data harvesting and collection by tech companies.

""Sorry, the best we can do is instituting 20-year prison sentences for using a VPN""."
"Hey, it's only okay when the USA does it.

/S

It's all bad but the lobbyists run Washington."
RIP every tech companies revenue. Would collapse the economy
"Ikr, they sit there and talk about how awful tiktok's data collection is as if they don't do it themselves. Only mad since it goes to a different government."
Every day we surrender more and more parental responsibilities to the government.
Never had it
Slide into the water and get it over with.  Everyone needs a lesson.
How about a bill that bans companies from collecting your data at all without an optional and clear opt in
Yup. I agree. It‚Äôs super easy for me to not have tik tok on my phone.
"Only 50% support it, the other 50% are a mix of against it and unsure."
">The moment TikTok is banned, a US company will create the same exact app with the exact same content.

I still am bewildered that musk hasn't taken vine out of Twitters attic, brushed the dust off of it, and seen how it can take off again."
">even more woke

Tiktok has more conservatives and conservative content than any other platform im aware of."
"Whenever there is significant bipartisan support on an issue, you can bet your ass something is not right. Patriot Act, Iraq war, Israel, Ukraine, etc, etc. The list goes on and on."
"There are other reasons too. People get their news and learn from TikTok. People discuss all sorts of topics, by doing stitches to other videos and doing video replies to commented question. It is both a social media platform and also a search engine. With user generated content/news/information, it eliminates the need for media and government narrative. They don‚Äôt like this."
"You mean following the will of the people, like a democracy?"
"How is preventing Americans who want to get an app/site from getting that app/site a ""reasonable objective?"""
Here's the kicker...you don't have to use TikTok...like just don't put it on your phone.
"Because it is a CCP company, and China is notoriously known for spying and data breaches. 

They are not to be trusted, and they literally steal everything to further their country."
"It's Chinese Spyware. 

Obviously the answer should be keeping it off all government devices and introducing a consumer privacy bill that limits all phones and apps' ability to harvest data not just while using the app but just when the app is on a phone (tik tok for example can see all your keystrokes just by having it on your phone)"
"Essentially TikTok does the exact same thing that Google, Facebook, etc use. 

We just don‚Äôt like how we have no idea where the data is going and what‚Äôs being done with it."
"because it's spyware, packaged in a social media app, and unlike Facebook, twitter and others, where the US could at least enforce some rules, it's uploaded and offloaded to china. 

I work in engineering and we can't use it or install it on dev devices.

Not saying that meta or twitter are any better, but if something truly bad were to happen at least you could sue and there would be repercussions"
"You don't even recognize Pew lmao, just google it."
"Yeah, and we're just told the first thing they will do with it is ban tiktok and that we should just trust them not to use all that power after that.

Even then it's unlikely they will fully ban it but instead will force a sale of the company to some ""good, honest American businessman"" who is friendly with the politicians."
"For a group of people who hate communism and promote freedom, they really are following right in their footsteps..."
"They can ban VPNs, and have every FBI agent tapping into your IP address to making Sure you can't meme or tapped into your router to see who's on the internet."
"Gotta be honest‚Ä¶if the internet went away, the entire world would be a better place."
"20 years in prison for using a vpn to access banned sites... but how exactly are they to know you accessed a banned site? Lol, now they need given a backdoor to all vpn encryption because I guess they're too lazy to keep trying to crack it themselves, and there goes the last bit of internet privacy as even if you're a weirdo who trusts the government and ""has nothing to hide so nothing to fear"" will be getting spied on by foreign governments and bad actor hackers who gained access to the backdoor as they always do and will do"
"I mean on the surface this sure sounds nice.

The biggest thing is the data that's harvested is currently seen as the company's data and not yours.

All these services are free to use and as the saying goes, if something is free that means you're the product."
"Eh, this bill aside, banning tik tok while still good really only opens the door to Instagram and YouTube swallowing up that market share with a fraction of a percent chance musk goes for some of it with vine (Twitter owns vine)"
Yeah to the point console brands will be forced to limit everyone to what the government say.
Damn good thing we're a constitutional republic [with democratic institutions].
"Tell that to the Jews in Nazi Germany. Will of the people my butt. Even if the majority of people want something wrong, it‚Äôs still wrong."
I mean we aren‚Äôt a Democracy though we‚Äôre a Republic.
Those people can just not use TikTok.
"The will of the people is to not use if they don't like it. I don't even have it installed I don't think. I checked it out once, so maybe it is still on my phone."
"Tik Tok is a Chinese communist party owned spy service, similar to Facebook being an American communist spy organization.

The Feds would prefer you use Facebook, their spy organization, not the Chinese version."
"How do you feel about reddit being partially owned by a Chinese company? 

(Tencent)"
But US companies already sell our data to china. Feels like TikTok is just the scapegoat for the restrict act.
In what way can they use tik tok to spy?
"Facebook goes farther than that already. A former coworker of mine was paranoid about ""big brother tracking ever move"". Oddly he had a Facebook account. He used only flip phones, claiming they were harder to track things on, and since it wasn't a smart phone it could be anyone. Ended up running into him at Walmart. Walked though a portion of the store talking about upcoming work junk. Suddenly my Facebook app popped up with a 'people you may know' and it was him. Facebook some how knew my phone was near his phone. Even odder, he did not put his phone number into Facebook, and being his phone was not a smart phone did not have the Facebook app.
If Facebook can figure shit out enough to spy that closely on someone intentionally trying not to be spied on, then the government has to be a lot better."
"It‚Äôs not just spyware. It‚Äôs a tool to mold the minds of youth in America. This is straight from Mao‚Äôs playbook. When you mold the youth in America to commit violence, you will win. 

That‚Äôs why Douyin (TikTok) is banned in China for those younger than 18."
Do they harvest data legally or illegally? What kind of data do they harvest?
I know pew research. But this poll is not accurate.
Exactly. Facebook (and other Meta shite) and Google will be fine because Zuc and Pichai are in their pockets.
If that passes can you imagine the attack on Conservative speech the Dems would make if they controlled both houses and the Presidency?  They'd make the Russians and Chinese look like saints.
The longer I live the less I view politics as a straight spectrum and the more I view it as a circle.  The further you go in one direction the more you adopt positions associated with the other side
"Under the act VPNS are criminalized. 
20 years*"
Got it. Just making sure we're all on the same page that the majority opinion doesn't matter.
"Nazi Germany was a dictatorship. Do you want a system in which one person decides for everyone, or in which the majority rules? I am not saying it is a perfect system, far from it. But it's better than a dictatorship. 

What do you propose we do instead?"
"So if a majority of Americans want it banned, and the officials they elected* vote and ban this app, that's the will of the people through elected officials. That's a democratic republic, right? What am I missing here?"
"So *against* the will of the majority? That's not very democratic, is it?"
Or...and hear me out...don't use the apps you don't want to use.
The difference is TikTok is owned by a government (yes technically...) while reddit isn't.
Partially owned is different than majority owned. It‚Äôs also different when your company is required by Chinese law to remain Chinese.
This 100%
"Simple, first I can think of right off the bat is the password credentials. Hpw many millions of Americans have the same password for Tik that they do for other apps"
"They know when I post from the diner about my spam & eggs!

Ohhhh the freedom hating communists!!"
"Facebook sells that data to the feds so they can spy on us without warrants. That's the only reason Congress gives a shit. If it was actually a principled stance against spying and supporting privacy, then they could have just passed a law protecting Americans from data collection, not some Ingsoc 1984 shit like the Restrict Act."
You don't even need a Facebook account. They have shadow profiles of everyone who doesn't have them.
"Facebook knows when you poop.

Yeah if I had my way Facebooks ability to harvest data like thay would be greatly reduced too.

Also side note even if you don't think you have a Facebook profile, you do.

Facebook utilizes shadow profiles by getting the contacts list from those who use it and getting a surprising amount of info off of that

>then the government has to be a lot better.

And on this note, did you know the government was working on trying to create a social media a lot like Facebook shortly before Facebook? But as Facebook started to succeed they gave up on it and a whole bunch of investment went into Facebook"
"Legally as well... we have practically no consumer protections in that regard.

And some reports have said they've lowered how much they harvest and how much China has free access to but it was everything you did on your phone and typed at one point."
"It's hilarious that this comment is downvoted. No one can tell you what data is being harvested, but everyone says it's bad."
"well they would continue to make china look like saints, but they would still paint russia as the bad guy."
What makes you think Republicans won't do the same if they get a chance?
"Connections to malicious services controlled by one of our (6) foreign adversaries, including VPN connections, yes. Unless the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence start adding everyone to the list of foreign adversaries (currently China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, Cuba, Venezuela) the impact will be non existent. In no way can VPN usage be affected outside of connections that meet these criteria. It‚Äôs also up to $1m, and up to 20 years.

Disagree with the bill if you want, hate it if you want, but at least try to read it and understand it before you do anything else.

I know the bill is unpopular and headlines are terming it ‚ÄúPatriot Act 2.0‚Äù, but as someone who‚Äôs spent COVID contracting for the government and battling these powers in the cyber space, I support it and see it as necessary action to secure our currently most vulnerable attack vector. The powers of the legislation are being insanely misconstrued, and it‚Äôs really not a long or confusing document to be able to see that yourself.

The only issue I do have with it is FOIA exemption. If we can be prosecuted for connecting to certain malicious systems, we have a right to know how they were deemed malicious."
"It doesn‚Äôt. It should be considered. But this is just another attack on free speech. You know, an enshrined right for all Americans."
">the majority opinion doesn't matter [when individuals' constitutionally protected rights would be violated]. 

FTFY and welcome to understanding what a republic is! Sorry that middle school social studies didn't already help you with that."
Did majority opinion matter when minorities were fighting for equal rights?    Just want to make sure that you really understand what would have happened if America was a true democracy 100 years ago
"Hitler was voted into power. Nazi Germany became that way because of the people. Dictatorships do not win without the will of the majority of people. That‚Äôs why you didn‚Äôt see a civil war amongst Germans during WWII like you saw in China, Vietnam, Korea."
"The people voted for Hitler and his evil regime because they felt like VICTIMS after WWI.  They embraced it, proudly gave up their kids and flew the flag to show their support.  Huh, why does that sound like today I wonder."
"Nah that sounds about right. Our government is a two part system. 

I don‚Äôt personally have an opinion on the ban, I haven‚Äôt read enough about it and I try not to give opinions on topics I‚Äôm not we‚Äôll versed in. Just chiming in about the Republic thing, many Americans think we are a pure Democracy when we aren‚Äôt."
Just so I'm clear... you're in favor of literally anything as long as the majority of people agree to it? Is that your idea of democracy?
TikTok is already mandated to house their user data on Oracle servers in the US
"Hell, tik tok could see what you typed in for password credentials when logging into other apps or sites (and what they were) if you just had it on your phone"
"Newsflash on this one, but every internet provider, cellular service provider, etc. Does this. They don't even sell it. Obtaining user data from providers is not legally considered unlawful search and seizure, and it is not considered 'your' data.  If the providers refuse to give the data up, the government will need a warrant, however they don't really put up much of a fuss about it and will give law enforcement pretty free reign over the your data."
They are nowhere as evil as the Dems.
What would you recommend we do instead? Sincerely curious. That's a slippery slope.
"So we have elected officials, if those elected officials decide to ban this app, as is the people will, that's a democratic republic, right? I've seen both sides of the aisle support banning Tik Tok, and I was curious as to other people's opinions. Thanks for sharing yours."
[Yes. A majority of Americans approved of the Civil Rights laws in 1964](https://news.gallup.com/vault/316130/gallup-vault-americans-narrowly-1964-civil-rights-law.aspx)
So what do you propose we do here if you don't want the will of the people? Sincerely curious.
"Also, In the final two free elections before Hitler‚Äôs rise to power, in July and November 1932, the Nazis received 38% and 33% of the vote, respectively ‚Äî a plurality but not enough to bring them into government. In the 1932 presidential election, Hitler lost to Hindenburg by a wide margin.

Hitler came to power not through elections, but because Hindenburg and the circle around Hindenburg ultimately decided to appoint him chancellor in January 1933. This was the result of backroom dealing and power politics, not any kind of popular vote. It is true that after Hitler was already ensconced as chancellor, the Nazis subsequently won the March 1933 elections. But this was in the wake of the Reichstag fire, when the government had passed an emergency law that sharply restricted the activities of left-of-center parties (including the arrest of many Communist leaders). Thus it is difficult to claim that these were ‚Äúfree and fair‚Äù elections.

[Source](https://lobelog.com/no-hitler-did-not-come-to-power-democratically/) How he came to power is actually incredibly interesting."
What do you propose we do instead?
"Yeah, I guess I could have worded my original comment better, but it did lead to some interesting conversations on the will of the people."
That's the definition of a democracy. Lol.
Sorry but that's not true. That's not how iOS or Android operating systems work. Each app is separated by design.
Sketchy shit
Thank you for agreeing with me.
Not let the government pass a bill allowing them full rights to ban apps because people can say things they don‚Äôt like.
"Pure majority opinion is oppression of the minority. To prevent this, we have restrictions of what exactly the majority can use the government to do, the most fundamental of which are what the constitution recognizes as our rights."
"No. The elected officials can not violate the constitution. If they do, it would be the responsibility of the judicial branch to strike down that unconstitutional law. 


Honest questions: are you a US voter and have you been through a US school system?"
Go back further than that.
"Also does this democracy only apply to federal level policies?  Because there's probably some states and towns that would democratically vote for some pretty racist policies.  But what, federal law supersedes that?  What if they voted they didn't want that?  Where does the democracy begin?  

America is part of the UN.  Should that be a democracy where the mass of the world votes on policy?  So we would have billions of Indians and Chinese dictating world affairs?

Where does your democracy start?   At what ""mass"" of people"
"There were pretty good measures to ensure voters were well-educated on issues back when this country first started, but if I listed the criteria I think you'd have a meltdown."
"Neither is a good system, power should be distributed optimally to the lowest level possible.  Our current system (A constitutional republic) is pretty damn good, unfortunately people continue to push power to the federal level and into the hands of cronies."
"So you have no complaints if we all vote that you should have all your possessions taken from you and you be locked up?

I mean, if the majority of people vote for it afterall."
"Yep, and the reason that democracy is trash."
Idk if Android is. I know it‚Äôs a feature of iOS though.
It's not anymore but a few years ago they had the ability to do this
"The government is not banning any apps.  They are making it legal for the government to have access to all private posts and conversations, encrypted or not."
"This survey wasn't about RESTRICT, but solely about tik tok, and I think that's a simplistic explanation as to why they want the app banned when there are sincere national security and privacy concerns expressed from both sides of the aisle."
"Why is there a discussion on both sides if this is unconstitutional? Why worry? Why do so many republicans support banning it if it's unconstitutional? Citing the article:

""Support for a government ban on TikTok is higher among Republicans and independents who lean toward the Republican Party than among Democrats and Democratic leaners (60% vs. 43%). It‚Äôs particularly high among conservative Republicans (70%) and less so among moderate or liberal Republicans (46%). Among Democrats, conservatives and moderates are more supportive of a ban than liberals (49% vs. 36%).""

I am a U.S. voter and college graduate. I'm trying to understand why some people are so against this in this sub, while overall party-wide it seems to be popular."
To the civil war? You realize The Union *was* the majority?
"If you don't know how federal and state laws relate, I can't really take the time to explain that to you dude. Absolutely I'm not entirely sure you understand the function of the United Nations."
"I'm aware of many of em. Do you think that's the best way? Or at least a better way? To revert back to that criteria?
Essentially land owning white males only? That's a relatively small portion of the population."
I think we definitely agree there.
"Of course I'd complain, that doesn't mean it wouldn't be the will of the people? Who ever said nobody is ever going to complain?"
You don't like the idea of a people's government?
"Sorry but that's still not how it works. They could steal information if you are using tik tok's browser to go to other sites within their app. They never had the ability to simply steal info from other apps by being installed on a phone. By design, iOS and Android doesn't allow this."
"Simple solution. Don't ban it outright. Ban them from requiring names, phone numbers, addresses or any other personal information or accessing unnecessary priveleges/data from u.s. consumers. Also require third party, U.S. security/compliance audits.Then fine them into bankruptcy for non compliance and provide consumer warnings. Let users choose to make informed decisions. Allow users to sue when their data is part of data mismanagment etc."
"Liberal Arts major, eh?"
"Social media is speech and protected by 1A. Congress has no right to ban a particular service because they don't like what is on it. If the discussion was about banning particular data collection practices or mandating consumer warnings, it may be different, but the RESTRICT Act was outrageous and offensive, and so is the idea of banning a particular company."
"Here we go guys, first guy to bring up race. Lol"
So you'd complain but you'd comply and go along with it as to not defy the will of the people?
I don't like the tyranny of the majority... allowing what  everyone likes and prohibiting what everyone doesn't like is a very bad way to govern.
Do you know what's included in liberal arts or is this just a joke because it contains the word liberal?
"This survey doesn't seem to be about RESTRICT, but Tik Tok alone. I guess I'm curious why so many republicans support the idea then? People like Hawley and Vance support it, so this isn't only laypeople. Im trying to understand that.

It seems very popular with Republicans who aren't on r/conservative"
"I mean, who else was allowed to vote? Excuse  my ignorance if I'm wrong."
You can defy the will of the people (laws) if you like. There are always repercussions (like jail time).
"Tyranny of the majority is an interesting phrase, i like that. 

So you're also against abortion laws, anti-lgbtq legislation and book banning and such I assume?"
"I do know.  I switched from being an English major to business. I realized I needed to be able to make money to live.  I am a great conversationalist, though."
"Most people don't seem to give a crap about civil liberties. Not sure what to tell you. 


To be clear, I don't use TikTok. I hate TikTok. I hate it when my family members use it, and I tell them all to stop. But I don't believe in banning everything I don't like."
Well clearly you‚Äôre melting down‚Ä¶ lol I‚Äôm a POC btw.
"So to be clear you wouldn't defy the will of the people? 

Personally if it was me the person coming to enforce it better catch me by surprise or at least be wearing lvl 4 plates"
I'm against most laws.
"If the majority of people wanted those laws, would you support it? Just because something is the will of the people but that doesn‚Äôt make it right"
"Business Admin, myself."
Thanks. That's the closest I've got to an answer and I'm just kinda dumbfounded by the bipartisan support for it. It doesn't seem to be that way on Reddit though. Appreciate you responses!
"That's what's up. I'm not melting down, I just asked who else was able to vote at the time? Lol.  

From what I know, it was only landowners, and excluded everyone under twenty one, all slaves, and all women. I also think there were restrictions on Jewish and Catholic voters? That I am admittedly less sure of."
"If banning tik tok is that important to you or a sign of something you don't like, by all means do you. I can think of things I feel similarly about, this one application is not it."
Fair enough.
"I don't think a majority of people would want those things because they are immoral. And studies show a majority do not support those things. 

And you don't have to support something, you have to support the system that lets the majority of the populations will be done. 

I do not expect every single thing I believe to be the law because there's not another person on the planet i agree with 100% on everything. But I also think the will of the majority is important."
"By ensuring that only white male landownerd could vote at the time restricted voting to people who were the most educated, because they had the **means** to be educated. 

I don‚Äôt think having some sort of literacy criteria is out of bounds given that we publicly provided education today. 

If you wanted to gripe about the state of the education system I would agree, and I have two suggestions on how to improve it. 

1. Prioritize curriculum which trains students‚Äô *critical thinking skills* Conservativism isn‚Äôt about rejecting science or expertise because to do so would mean rejecting the very skills and knowledge thst not only drives innovation in the free market, but which is responsible for the progression of Man from the horse and carriage to the aero plane. We don‚Äôt hold onto the traditions of American Ideals and the proven ways because *they are old* but because *they are true*. Our task then is to work to understand how modern technologies fit within the Constitutional Framework balancing necessary government authority with the duty of government to maximize our liberty. 

2. Institute a civics curriculum which not only teaches the Constitution in an **Originalist** manner in order to understand the document, also teach natural rights philosophy which is the school of thought  which had a massive influence on our Founding Documents. And also teach that our rights and freedoms are predicated on our execution of our civil duties. 

For example: everyone in our country appreciates their rights to a lawyer and a *trial by a jury of their peers*, but for us to have the right it is our *duty* to serve others on Juries. In other words to enjoy our rights we have duties and responsibilities to uphold. 

The Constitution is the law of the land and I‚Äôm willing to bet most Americans don‚Äôt know what their rights are beyond the 1st, 2nd, and 5th Amendments. And anyone who claims the Constitution is a ‚Äúliving document‚Äù is not only delusional about how documents work but is in effect saying we are a nation ruled by men not laws. No thank you. 


In short I say: Bring Back the Party of Goldwater!"
Why do you refuse to answer the question?
"So in essence, you would support it in this hypothetical scenario because you believe whatever the majority of people agree on should be the highest law, regardless of its morality. Is that correct? I don‚Äôt want to put words in your mouth"
"Well the OP didn't respond, but that was what I'm curious what he meant. I wonder if he meant someone must have a high school diploma, or pass some sort of comprehension test to be able to vote. Or own land. They sort of beat around the bush on what they meant so I can't really say. 

I do agree an informed opinion is incredibly important, and that begins with a good education."
"The question of what I would do if the majority of the US decided to strip me of all my possessions and lock me up? yes, if that imaginary situation happened, I think I would attempt to defy the will of the majority. 

However, banning tik tok is not my line in the sand."
"I believe in the system we have in place in which we elect officials to do the will of the people. And if that system is functioning properly the will of the people is done. 

That being said, the will of the people is not always what I agree with and support. I *do*, however, agree with the process in which the results are achieved. Unless you have a better process hiding somewhere."
Im just trying to keep the conversation going with my own views on the matter.
"Huh. So as long as you aren't personally affected, you're fine with violations of other people's constitutional rights. This is why simple democracy is a horrible idea and why the founders worked so hard to set up a system that was not a simple democracy."
"I think that representative government is about as good as we‚Äôve come up with. However, it requires a constitution/bill of rights that sits above all the other laws and a judicial branch, like we have, to ensure laws are in line with that constitution. Some rights, like self defense, property ownership, or freedom of religion, are inviolable, no matter what the majority of people want. There has to be a higher authority to protect those rights from infringement. I think a majority of people would eventually trade them for the promises offered by tyrants."
"That's what made me so curious about this poll, it has huge support on both sides, and prominent Republican officials have said they support a Tik Tok ban. Outside of Reddit, it seems popular amongst republicans and democrats alike."
"I would support it if the law just prevented TikTok from being downloaded and forbade the company (an arm of the CCP) from doing business here, but it goes far beyond that to give the government an absurd amount of power to get rid of anything they dislike. It would provide extreme levels of discretionary power that the government does not deserve."
"> Within a month of taking office, Bragg faced backlash from police officers, small business owners, and public officials over a memo that instructed prosecutors to avoid seeking jail time for certain crimes including robbery, assault and gun possession.

This is insanity.  Deliberate destruction of society."

He doesn‚Äôt deserve to hold the last name of Bragg.
"That is one way to lower crime, don't prosecute."
"Well, ""Shitbag"" probably wouldn't work well in public forums."
That ought to go well with CMTs audience.
CMT as in country music television? They‚Äôre aware of who their audience is right?
Must have disappointed all ten viewers...      /s
Country music and its industry has turned to shit so this is not surprising.
Country music is forgetting where it came from and who their listeners were.
"Look at what Budweiser did too, i.e.: They don‚Äôt know their market."
You think Starbucks white girl is watching or cousin billy?
They know. They‚Äôre going to intentionally antagonize.
I haven‚Äôt listened to country forever but I remember there being real country and pop with a twang. So if cmt is mostly the latter then I‚Äôd say Starbucks white girl
"Joke is going to be on Budweiser when they:

Not going to happen.  The FBI is going to destroy the manifesto and claim her motive is unknown.
Just call it terrorism.
I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll get right on it lol
"Better yet, just eliminate ‚Äúhate crimes‚Äù altogether."
The fact that nothing about the manifesto is being revealed is telling onto itself.
Silly GOP.  It's only  a hate crime when the victims are a Democrat voting minority.
"Fuck hate crimes.  Call it left wing terrorism, it's what it is."
"And that's assuming they haven't done so already. All the 3 letter bureaus NEED to be dissolved, not remade/reformed."
"Or more likely claim that she had an obsession with an old basketball team she was a member of and probably wanted to shoot up areas that she was familiar with because she was suicidal.

To me that's the easiest way to avoid drawing too much attention to her gender identity."
"The only reason to not release the manifesto is that its exactly what everyone suspects it to be - the truth that trans and leftists hate Christians and see them as oppressors that must die.  That the shooter believed this to be a righteous action, meaning liberals and the LBTQ community would have to address this ideology head on in the public sphere."
The republic has failed. There's no confidence in the voting system and most people on both sides are uninterested in restoring that confidence. The justice system is a joke and literally everybody knows that politics decides who gets prosecuted and who goes free. All we're waiting for now is for enough people to realize it and that things need to change.
Same as #metoo I think you got to do a few to point out the hypocrisy then move on
"Tit-for-tat actually, should be easy enough I'm sure..."
Then it doesn't deserve to survive.
The problem is you have no choice but to match them or one side will club the unarmed side to death. Imagine if only one party did this and did it regularly. There has to be a counterbalance
"""The final results were 442,210 for ‚Äòyes‚Äô and 423,418 for ‚Äòno‚Äô, a narrow majority for yes of 51% vs 49% of those who turned out. However, with just 18% showing up to vote in favour, the support fell far short of the quorum of 25% of the population of 2,430,000 that was needed, so the motion failed.""

So, did people just not care or did they count on not reaching a quorum?"
"I really struggle to understand why anyone would vote in favor of a Net Zero economy. The vast majority of the population will be forced to live under a 19th century economy under such a plan.

(Unless you go nuclear, but Germany and the rest of the green movement refuses to do that)"
"Title is misleading. Makes it sound like 82% voted no, rather 82% did not vote. Either way the referendum fails, but they are not the same."
They just spent their winter watching their energy bills skyrocket.  Might have dawned on them just what 'net zero' is going to entail.  And that was just a taste.
Net zero can‚Äôt exist. It‚Äôs almost practically impossible.
Horribly misleading title
Sure would be helpful if someone would explain this to me like I'm 4
Watch as it's implemented anyway.
"Be-ut-iful. Warms the cockles of my heart that they'd reject this in Germany of all places. They've been under this green energy spell for so long I thought they were pretty much written off.

The energy crisis following the Ukrainian war and the complete lack of reliability of the green infrastructure they've instituted has apparently caused them to wake up some  This gives me hope for the rest of the world."
82% of Berlin's voters like having jobs to go to and warm houses to come home to.
Stories like this give me hope.
"This is dangerous voting practices.... Eventually I foresee the left everywhere removing quorum requirements, thus making voter atrophy no longer a ""no"" vote. 

Leftists are collectivists, they vote when told. If a majority of them end of saying yes to things, odds are it'll be more than the quantity of people who decide to vote no on the same things. That being said as leftist governments do not get their way, in the future, I'm afraid the quorum requirement will be removed.  

If you disagree with something, you need to go vote No, not just assume enough other people will vote no for you. This diffusion of responsibility is going to end up killing any chance for center or right leaning voters, policies, and ideas if we don't pay attention."
"On a related note, I like the idea of a quorum for democratic votes. Worth considering in the US."
"I know its just weather but it‚Äôs supposed to be highs of 6-10 degrees celsius where I am right now and it‚Äôs -10.

Where I am it feels like we are on the dawn of another fucking ice age."

How about we don't."
"You know in America, you'd have the opposite where over 82% would turn out to vote and you'd be banned for finding that suspicious."
"Only the 'yes'-side was holding rallies and buying ads and billboards promoting this referendum. Given the disparity in expenses and effort between the 'yes' and 'no' side, it's actually quite shocking that the 'no's almost got a majority of the casted votes."
Yes
"&#x200B;

Man imagine the world if there was no Chernobyl that changed the view on nuclear power plants so hard it will be hard to recover i mean the other disasters was the cause of natural disasters i mean you can't say a tsunami or a earthquake did not have any effects on the power plants"
A lot of bullshit out there to scare people - being told only the negative effects of fossil fuels and not the much WORSE negatives of not having them. Like War and poverty. Too bad they lost their industrial base to learn it.
"I work for a German company - they are smooth brain to the max when it comes to climate change and how to solve it. They consider nuclear to not be carbon neutral. I had a guy with a 100% straight face tell me ‚Äúall of your carbon emissions will be offset when we purchase carbon credits, this is how we will achieve carbon neutrality‚Äù‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶."
Vast of majority of people don't. Ask them. They all disagree. Not kidding - go to random person and ask them.
The title is horribly misleading. This would be like saying 250M voters went against Trump when the reality is 200M didn‚Äôt or couldn‚Äôt vote at all.
"Welcome to fringe media. Doesn't matter if it is right wing or left wing, don't let the truth get in the way of the point you're trying to make."
"Can it not exist? Or almost practically impossible?

Edit: I‚Äôm just making a joke, guys. Chill üòâ."
Three Mile Island scared the pants off people too.
"Basically every major oil and gas company has a net zero by 2050 or around there timeframe now. The way net zero is calculated is flawed though because getting delivered pricing would mean you have zero delivery emissions soooooo it's not at all accurate.

Personally I don't mind the net zero mindset, but only if it doesn't impact overall quality of life and cost, which is unlikely."
"There is no question about the fact that the enormously massive amount of fossil fuel we are using are causing massive problems to our planet, but the other fact is that with our current technology and our current infrastructure, the alternatives of going 100% renewable on both housing, appliances and vehicles are either near impossible or way too expensive. 

I support dropping petroleum, gas and coal for everything but the barest of the bare minimum, but currently it's not entirely feasible and we should be looking at things in-between instead of directly switching from one to the other in all matters.

For cars for example most german brands are developing synthetic fuel with zero emission as an in-between because electric is just not there yet if you don't live your whole life inside a 1 hour ride circle. I'm sure better infrastructure and pricing will follow for solar panels for homes."
"That‚Äôs impressively short sighted; and it saddens me greatly people don‚Äôt see through it.

We have a similar problem in the USA where blue states shut down all their coal plants and then buy energy from neighboring red states‚Ä¶ which have coal power plants."
Sad thing in Germany. I always marveled at their incredible engineering capabilities and collective tenacity of the nation. 82% not turning up to vote shows that the German population no longer care as they knew they will be screwed regardless.
"It can exist, just not alongside civilization. Even cows fart, so you can't even live like a second century farmer with net zero carbon. That is, if it's truly net zero and not some statistically cherry picked abomination of data."
"AFAIK, It‚Äôs based on carbon credits, which is a scam in itself."
It‚Äôs a terrible philosophy based on nonsense. The poorest will suffer from it and the corrupt will get richer. And weather won‚Äôt change
"How do you know synthetic fuels are less harmful? 

The harm is minimal compared to the massive advantages of having ample energy for clean water, reliable heat, shelter, medicines and treatments, etc. you really havent studied it in any depth at all if you think ‚Äúthe barest minimum‚Äù use of reliable energy won‚Äôt cause extreme misery. Some non scalable study isn‚Äôt going to change facts."
"There is no conflict between farting cows and a net zero economy. The carbon that they emit by farting has been taken from the atmosphere by the grass using photosynthesis, and this is a natural process that has been going on since life began on earth.

The only thing that is in conflict with net zero carbon emissions is taking carbon that was locked deep in the earth for millions of years and releasing it into the atmosphere.

If we stop using fossil fuels, we automatically become carbon neutral. 

(Except using oil and gas for creating plastic and other chemicals, this is where carbon capture and storage are necessary to achieve net zero emissions. Those emissions are far less than the burning of fossil fuels releases every year though.)"
"Net Zero is a scam just to get enough proletariat to off themselves. The globalist elites will be fine polluting the air with their breath, farts, and private jet emissions if enough of us starve or freeze to death."
"I mean, you‚Äôre kind of glossing over the word ‚Äúnet‚Äù there. Net zero means reducing emissions and also working on ways to remove carbon from the atmosphere"
They aren't... But they hurt the fossil fuel industry
"How do you know this? Synthetic fuels require more energy and processing, and the widespread impacts of burning them are unlikely to be less harmful"
That's what I'm saying... They are a giant scam.
Sorry misread your post.
No problem
"They were and the libs are jumping for joy because of it and have justified the shooter for doing it.

It's pretty disgusting"
The timing of Trump's arrest after this tone-deaf handling of a tragedy is very suspicious.
Anytime anyone turns these events into some sort of political ‚Äúvictory‚Äù I‚Äôm fucking disgusted. It just so happens the left does it significantly more.
In one of the articles I thought it said that the first target was the mall across the street from the school but she wanted something with less security. I know they‚Äôre not releasing the manifesto but does anyone know where I can go for more details on this?

Bingo.  Deflecting from the trans murderer.  And it‚Äôs working.
Pretty sad that a mall has more security than a school.  Aren't those mostly abandoned wastelands at this point?
Hopefully the made-up word was Huminuherzwits. I got that on my Bingo card.
"Nah, they only see 1 victim.... They only see the shooter as the victim.   They feel the children were just late term abortions and the adults deserved it because they were christian."
"I seem to remember a LGBT club getting shot up in Colorado Springs and no one rioted, but hey that was just one shooting right???"
"A bunch of trans activists just rioted in 3 different state capitols but sure, if there was a mass lgbt/trans shooting a few days before when they insist they‚Äôre the subject of ‚Äúgenocide,‚Äù I‚Äôm sure that wouldn‚Äôt affect anything /s"
"Yes but I was responding to your original comment regarding mass shootings and if  the situation was reversed what would it look like. I provided a real life example of a community coming together in a positive way instead of rioting and because you‚Äôre arguing in bad faith you brought up a red herring to distract from the fact that I countered your point. 

Also, people tend to get upset when you dehumanize them. Also, nobody died at these so-called riots so your argument fails again."
"how did you counter my point? Had a bunch of trans people gotten killed last week, the riots in the state capitols would be much more severe, that was my point? If your point is that once upon a time there was an unrelated shooting and people didn‚Äôt riot, okay I guess? That‚Äôs good."
"Read your own handwriting you are speaking in hypotheticals meaning it hasn‚Äôt happened. Also, see the Pulse nightclub shooting, transgender people were killed. In the Colorado Springs at least one killed actively identified as transgender. Stop using a tragedy to spread hate."
Democrats.  Democrats are the reason.
I have a whole [list of reasons why here](https://imgur.com/a/QAmtmdN)
"Oh, and the guy he shot at had gang ties and is getting released.  Yep.  That's liberal lunacy for you"
It‚Äôs all on purpose
This isn't lunacy. This is the left trying to shackle the American public to fear and violence.
"well, sadly this is where we are going as a people.

Like the deli owner a few months ago that was robbed and he stabbed the perp to death.  The locked him up for  4 months before the news broke the story and got him out."
Now they care
This is why Biden won't go there.
"Worth mentioning that it was like seven people who had symptoms for a few hours only and continued working afterwards without issue.

At any rate, a guy jumped me for my wallet, nothing fancy moreso typical NYC mugging.  

BUT because I‚Äôm built, honestly, better than the average able bodied person, I beat this man down.  Down bad.  And when I got him on the ground I used the wheelchair as a weapon to stomp on his chest and neck.  

Turns out he was homeless and NYC is responsible for the hospital bills of homeless people (somehow).  

I was charged with excessive self defense as I went above and beyond with no care that my fight or flight instincts kicked in. My goal was to stop him.  He wound up on life support.  

It took a LOT of money and a great lawyer to ask the DA if they really wanted this story ‚Äúin the news.‚Äù

This was 2008 or so.  

I‚Äôm not shocked by this post at all. Imagine if I couldn‚Äôt afford that lawyer."
Move the F out of blue areas if you're not down with the blue antics.
This is totally a banana republic
"You get what you vote for, New York."
NY is speedrunning being a bigger shithole than California
"Other charges aside, charging someone with criminal possession of a firearm after they wrestle away a gun from someone who just shot them is completely insane."

No, HE valued my property more than his life."

"Bragg cares more about prosecuting Trump than he does about taking violent criminals off the streets. Soros funded DAs, like my own DA in upstate NY, don't care about prosecuting criminals."
NYC is such a shite hole.
"Not again. And once again it‚Äôs NYC. No surprise there.

So, this unfortunate parking attendant was shot in the stomach; he tried to fight the perpetrator, and shot him. He obviously was trying to save his life, thinking the criminal would most assuredly, finish him off, especially since he could identify the shooter?

What a state, what did you all vote in?! The ones who voted for NYS‚Ä¶aka Dodge City aka Wild West wanna-bee.

Is not a man to defend himself‚Ä¶is that the message? Must men no longer feel upset when they are attacked, hurt? How docile does this state want men‚Ä¶or women?

Should one just take the hit and die?

What the government is forcing people to do is stop calling the police after a self defense scenario.  There is no advantage in being honest in this situation when you can be sure you will be charged anyway.
"Well if they can't take away peoples guns, maybe they can make them afraid to use them. Keep in mind this case is anecdotal, and it may be highly publicized for just his purpose."
"Wow imagine being shot twice, getting the gun from your would be murderer and shooting him only to be charged.  Sorry not sorry but if you‚Äôre seriously wounded all bets are off and you have every right to permanently put down your aggressor.  Democrats are pro crime and cases like this blatantly prove it."
The NY system clearly works for criminals.
"Good news, the prosecutor is not pursuing the case against the garage worker.  Both men were initially charged because they were trying to figure out what happened since both men were on the ground with gun shot wounds.

"Welcome to bizarro land. 


Criminals have more rights than victims"
Wife and kid loved to take long weekend trips to NYC. Too bad they will not see another penny of our money for years to come.
"Visitor here, have lived in Manhattan for 10 years now, trying to get some perspective, let me lend just a bit of context given i am close with a number of NYC ADAs. 

This incident occurred at 5:30am Saturday. Outside of normal working hours, ADAs work in something called the complaint room, where the police bring in suspects, police report and suggested charges and the ADAs ‚Äúwrite them up‚Äù, or make a decision on charges based on available evidence. 

This garage attendant couldn‚Äôt have been indicted yet because grand juries don‚Äôt work on the weekend. My guess is NYPD brought both in having written up attempted murder on both, ADA agreed on initial pass of available evidence (which 
 would likely only be witness accounts / hospital reports because there‚Äôs no way they get security video that quickly).

Do I agree with the outcome as it currently stands? Of course not, but I do think that cooler heads will prevail once people get a chance to sort through. On the other hand, I think that certain news outlets are jumping over a yet-incomplete situation to drive clicks."

"I live in the NYC area. About 10 years ago, I left my house to go to a job interview and when I came back I found the house broken into and was ransacked. So I didn‚Äôt know if they were still inside so I grabbed a giant chef knife from the kitchen and called 911. They told me to run outside. The police showed up 15 minutes later and they tried to take me in because I had the knife in my hand. ‚ÄúWhy do you have a knife?‚Äù Is what they asked me. Like wtf. It‚Äôs a city where victims are criminalized. It‚Äôs been this way for a while."

"It‚Äôs terrible but they kind of get what they deserve. Decades of electing really horrible leaders who told them ahead of time what they wanted to do has consequences. Also, any self respecting human would have left NYC years ago. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôve been to NYC multiple times and it has/had many great qualities. But in the last 7 years it has sunk to a shell of its formal self and I‚Äôm not sure how or when they can right the ship. Do feel bad for this guy though.

"That makes absolutely no sense. Doesn't murder require premeditation? If anything this could be manslaughter, but given the context of self defense even that's bullshit."
This is yet another reminder to get out of blue states ASAP. Right now the are just selectively applying the law. Very soon they will just start arresting conservatives without bothering with a pretext.
"https://nypost.com/2023/04/02/bragg-wont-charge-wounded-garage-worker-who-shot-suspected-thief/amp/

He was charged by police, which is a fairly standard thing to do when you show up and find people shot, arrest, charge, and let the DA and investigators sort it out. Bragg has stated the charges will be dismissed. His lawyer is content.

‚Äú But Bragg ‚Äî who is already under fire for indicting former President Donald Trump last week in a fraud-related case ‚Äî will dismiss the case against Diarra ‚Äúpending further investigation,‚Äù his office said.

The raps remain against Rhodie.

‚ÄúWe are more than pleased with the result,‚Äù Diarra‚Äôs lawyer, Charles Clayman, told The Post on Sunday.‚Äú"
"I know this is a long shot, but, in case the truth matters: my understanding is that the garage worker disarmed the other person and then shot them in the chest."
Welcome to George Soro‚Äôs world.
"I wish we had a GOP President that would actually invoke the exemption in the PCA that allows the President to use the military to protect civil rights when the state cannot or refuses to.

Ike used that to take control of the Arkansas National Guard and sent the 101st Airborne (famous for the defense of Bastogne) to ensure that Black students could register and attend classes."
"I'm a Ccw holder in ny. 

My Ccw course instructor put it this way: 

In NY state you have a duty to retreat. Your best bet is to get 911 on the phone while retreating and while the operator is listening talk to the assailant by saying ""I am afraid for my life"", "" I have a gun and am prepared to defend myself"" and ""please don't make me do this"".

Of course this is rediculous, you can't do that in reality. But that's the thought process here...even if they break into your home."
"This is what New Yorkers voted for so they can go fuck themselves. If you still live in a democrat city at this point whatever happens to you in your own fault. You reap what you sow, roaches."
"Hypothetically, if I were to point a fake, but realistic, gun at this DA and he were allowed to wrestle it away from me and pull the trigger only to have it go ""click"", he would then be up on attempted murder charges, by his own rules.

I mean, I knew the gun was fake, so no attempted murder on my part. He didn't. He tried to kill me.

Why would anyone live in a place like that?"
And now for the rest of the story where it will all make sense.
"I love that the Americans are new to this kind of thing.  Even if I shot and kill an armed robber who broke into my house while I was living in Europe, I would be tried for murder and rest assured that I would spend a year or two in prison and  at least 10 years in prison if he was unarmed."
"It's a little weird that I can't find anything about this anywhere except three conservative news sites.  The DA office making a statement implies a press release, right?"
"At first thought there had to be something more to the story to justify the charge but no, the more to the story just makes the DA‚Äôs decision sound even more stupid."
"Man that guy had nerves of steal to attempt to wrestler away the firearm from the robber when it got brandished. Both are being charged with attempted murder, I‚Äôm actually surprised they both lived after one got shot in the chest and another in the stomach.

Needless to say the attempted murder charge against the garage worker is total BS. I‚Äôm not sure if the DA was forced to charge him with attempted murder but hopefully it‚Äôs gets dropped."
Why was the district attorney ever a political position.
Typical democrat trash siding with the criminal and not the victim.
"But let‚Äôs indict Trump on some trumped up 7 year old charges. Yeah Bragg, you are one ugly piece of work."
"Fortunately, the DA decided not to be a complete tool and dropped the charges. That‚Äôs still law enforcement for you."
"I hate to play devil's advocate, but he should have called the police instead of taking him outside to question him. It's likely the ""thief"" didn't get the opportunity to steal anything, so it could be argued in court that he was unlawfully detained by a citizen (garage attendant) and felt the need to defend himself. Common sense says that he was a thief and should be questioned, but when people get shot everyone gets super focused on the details.

TLDR: In NY, simple trespassing and even theft are not crimes in which lethal force would be permitted. A garage attended doesn't have authority to be a vigilanty, and the alleged thief's lawyer or public defendant would likely argue that the illegal detaining of the suspected thief is what led to the shooting.

Edit: Downvote all you want; I stand by this, even as a proud gun-owner and gun rights advocate myself."
"RI has it weird too. You can shoot a hostile, but if there is no other form of escape. Once, an abusive ex-boyfriend came to his ex-girlfriend‚Äôs house, broke in, tried to break down her bedroom door (she had it locked) and she shot him dead through the door. Afterwards, she was charged with murder and sentence to prison, because the jury ruled she had a clear way to escape the scene by jumping out the window. By the way, it was a 2 story building, I highly doubt she could have survived the jump"
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this guy voted Blue his whole life and is now wondering how this happened.

That's fucking crazy!
"I grew up in New York and I miss it sometimes, but I read stuff like this and it makes me glad I live in a red state now and sad for what my home state is becoming."
"I hate to say this, but if NYC allows this crap to go on, then it's like they are for purposely trying to force you out of your home to find a safer environment. If you can't protect yourself, your belongings, or your family, something is very wrong. These are constitutionally protected rights given to you by God."
i wonder why there's so much crime in NY. criminals have more rights than you do
"Wait‚Ä¶.this guy gets shot, wrestles the gun away from the shooter, and gets charged with criminal possession of a firearm?  That would be laughable if it wasn‚Äôt so sad."
This not surprising but it‚Äôs also very sad.  That guy is a hero in my book.
"When you see something bad happen and ask why doesn't anyone intervene, here is your answer"
Gtf out of NY! It‚Äôs full communist
What the crap
"Reminds me of the concept of Anarcho-Tyranny. Government is unable to stop criminals or establish public safety. Creating violence and crime on the streets which resemble anarchy... but are able to tax and persecute the populace, a tyranny."
"\> Everybody flees to warm Red states and leaves their home, family, and values to die ""WoW sEe I kNeW iT wAs BeCoMiNg A lIbErAl CeSs PoOl"".  Well no shit, all the opposition fled like a coward with its tail tucked between it's legs.

I love WNY and don't give a shit about the city.  I know my Sheriff and DA would never prosecute a crime in this manner (or uphold the SAFE act, they haven't yet and have no plans to start) yet all of my friends fled and moved to SC/PA as did 90% of the other conservative minded people I grew up with.  I literally own the same guns they do, they're just too afraid of Daddy government and need permission before they'll do something and then say shit like ""I don't respect the ATF"" when fear of some omnipotent government agency is literally why they fled, and then they wonder why their home state is trending in the direction it is... meanwhile they move into literal cities in the south and their homes cost half a million dollars and where they can't even *afford the guns they want to have, anyways*.  Living in WNY doesn't suck, NYC is a shit hole, sure; but people run from the parts of themselves they hate thinking they'll leave it at the door but never do, then you're just miserable and poorer somewhere else meanwhile your home state is worse off for it all.  Yes, I'm a little salty living in the rust belt and watching all of my friends leave, sue me.

At least in WNY I get to be an ""outlaw"".  I can't imagine fleeing my home just because of some liberal agenda 400 miles away or living in fear like that.  Even if some guns/steel plates, etc. are illegal, police aren't welcome on my property in the first place, so it won't really ever be problem, will it?"
This is fucking disgusting
You won't see me visiting that shithole of a state.
Ny is a shit hole. Criminals have more rights than the victims.
This is the reason why people are running from there to ruin my state.
Awesome so I can go out and steal cars from people and they can‚Äôt do a thing about it?

"No, you can't.  Your only self defense option is to run away."
"There's the technically correct answer of you have the right to use deadly physical force consistent with Article 35 of the New York Penal Law, which is rather limited, but there's the other end of it where the DA may decide to make you prove the affirmative defense of justification. Sometimes it should be a no brainer, but we saw Bragg locked up the Bodega owner that defended himself."
"He probably talked to the police without his lawyer.  
""I won't be answering any questions without my lawyer present. I do  not consent to any searches or seizures."" 4th and 5th amendments. Then shut your mouth and keep it shut, don't argue with the police, or even talk to friends or family about it. Let your lawyer do all the talking.  Especially in a liberal paradise like NYC."
Democrats hate Republicans so much that they're ok with pandering to criminals.
The NYC DA is carefully selecting his high profile cases to build his political future on the left side of the spectrum.
"The guy wasn't charged with anything, the cops showed up to a shooting, found two guys shot and one gun, arrested both on suspicion of attempted murder, and then started investigating what happened. The DA is only actually pressing charges against the thief, but that doesn't make nearly as sensational a story."
"Never thought of it exactly that way, but, that single sentence perfectly sums up the current state of America."
That is why we all have a duty to jury nullification
I wouldn't be surprised if the left started a GoFundMe for the thief that got shot.
"This wasn‚Äôt self-defense. His life wasn‚Äôt being threatened. 
He simply could have taken photos from a phone or called the police.
He engaged the person. 
Then he had to fend for his life.
He has a duty to observe and retreat, before engaging in NYC"
That might be the most ridiculous part of all this.  Picking up the gun of the guy who shot you to defend yourself is illegal possession. A total joke.
Shot in stomach AND grazed in the ear. The other guy literally tried to murder him.
"Absolutely hysterical, yet tragic."

"Also avoid California, where it's legal for someone to intentionally give you AIDs."
The people there are voting for it.
"That, and the crazy legislature in NY."
Bragg -- prosecute the innocent and free the guilty. Marxism 101.
"As a law enforcement officer, we have been preaching this for years. Everyone is up in arms about police reform, and while I‚Äôm not going to argue no changes are necessary, I will argue the focus needs to be on judicial reform in regards to judges and DAs. Imagine how many people (career criminals) would be alive today, the millions of less victims, and the billions in property damage that would have been spared if only people were actually sentenced properly for their crimes. I locked up a guy last month for my third time for burglary in two years. He‚Äôs been arrested by my agency alone 6 times and another 7 times by the county for felonies during that time span. He‚Äôs still on parole and probation from a 1983 armed robbery/murder. I‚Äôve taken four firearms off the guy in two of those arrest. Yet he‚Äôs still walking free right now. His rap sheet was about 67 pages last time I checked‚Ä¶ but if he decides to fight us and he gets hurt or killed after trying to kill us, we‚Äôd be in national news dealing with riots. It amazes me how people out on bond awaiting multiple trials with conditions not to commit another crime (while currently on probation) do not get their probation or bonds revoked. Judges and DAs have ruined our country and have absolute immunity- meaning they can purposely do wrong and have no consequences. Meanwhile, cops get thrown under the bus with qualified immunity (meaning if they did wrong, they don‚Äôt qualify). The best anyone can do is vote for a new judge and DA every cycle."
"Not that long ago, the one drawback of living in a blue state was paying a little more in taxes. But in 2023, a normal person can no longer live and raise a family in a blue state due to rampant crime, an insane public education system, highly burdensome taxes, unchecked homelessness and public displays of drug use, and open hostility from government towards anyone who uses force to defend themselves or who holds traditional right-wing views."
"You are wise, and blessed."

NYC would have preferred he die so they can stand on his grave and scream for more gun control. They don‚Äôt want the serfs to see self defense as a valid idea.
What happens when someone else calls the police and they pull up cctv footage of what happened? You get fucked either way.
You are spot on. It is deliberate intimidation. They almost want to turn the US into a third world country where criminals have all the guns and they threaten the citizens while the cops look away.
"‚ÄúThere's no way to rule innocent men. The only power any government has is the power to crack down on criminals. Well, when there aren't enough criminals, one makes them. One declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking laws.‚Äù"
I hope more people see this and understand how the legal process works in cases like these. I don't enjoy seeing these knee-jerk reactions continually topping the sub in place of real shit we need to worry about. Seen your comment get downvoted twice while looking at it. What is wrong with people.
I‚Äôm sure NYC won‚Äôt notice
"The problem with this, is that this thought process requires someone to correct another persons mistake. How often in any government do people just go with it. In this case, the ‚Äújust go with it‚Äù will put an innocent victim behind bars and likely destroy many aspects of his life."
"Refer to the movie ""Escape From New York"""
He was also shot in the process.
A gunfight ends when someone gets shot. Not when it gets stolen.
I wonder if it was caught by surveillance cameras.
"He was shot in the fucking stomach ffs. We should be applauding this man for taking one more piece of trash, who violently abuses innocent people, out to the curb."
"Right, which means according to the DA the threat was neutralized therefor attempted murder."
Absolutely ludicrous. There should be some sort of presumption that an intruder would be armed and thus a threat to your life.
The DA didn't file the charges and hasn't made any statement yet. The charges were filed by the NYPD.
">  I‚Äôm not sure if the DA was forced to charge him with attempted murder but hopefully it‚Äôs gets dropped.

The DA didn't charge him; the NYPD charged him

"Typical.

"While I do not agree with a large/well equipped police force, it's such a joke that when they do arrest someone nothing happens, I cannot imagine how futile it must feel risking your life with little reward.

Even from a ""humanitarian"" view, anyone desperate enough to be committing property crime/violent crime *deserves help*.  That help looks like *helping them by arresting and stopping the vicious cycle they are caught in.*  They *need* to be locked away because they have no defense against themselves.  A heroin addict so desperate he's committing crime needs time away from heroin, otherwise he will just keep committing the same crime, because he lacks the willpower/self control/ability to stop using drugs, will go to any length to obtain them, and has limited means to do so, and he cannot hold down a job because his disease has progressed so far, so of course he will turn to crime.  Same with people violating orders of protection... it's usually a toxic relationship and these people are addicts and emotionally stunted because of trauma or a horrible upbringing, and they simply cannot let a person go, or keep going back to them, or the relationship mends itself and is then leveraged against them.

There should be ZERO bail reform.  However, there should be MUCH MORE mental health programming in jails specifically.  Not just prisons.  The repeat offenders/drug addicts who end up in jail deserve an opportunity to learn and better themselves, as well.  But we don't.  We let them get away with the same crime 50 times, we put them in jail for a year, they get zero help in jail, or awareness of their problems, or coping skills, and then release them right back into the same environment and into the same patterns with zero additional skills, except maybe connections and friends from jail.

The upper class wants no peace, they just want us to turn on each other.  And then people defend bail reform because they think it's the most understanding option, it is \*not\* understanding, it is inhumane, and they often die before they get help.  And to top it off, the same people that bemoan incarceration/etc. *want more laws.*  More laws to accomplish what, exactly?  More police interactions?  More dead police/criminals?  More gun fights?  There is zero point to additional laws if there are no consequences for the criminal or benefit to society (helping them while incarcerated, less recidivism, etc.)."
Absolutely.
"Greeting from California. :(

"Hi! Victim of a blue state here. My life is pretty great!

Despite living so close to downtown, my area is significantly safer statistically than my home red state. In fact, I've only had 1 situation where I felt any kind of danger, compared to hundreds back home. You know what they say about poverty and crime - turns out my home red state has significantly higher rates of poverty!

Speaking of poverty, I'm glad my state has a higher minimum wage. My salary is so high that we make more than we need - I'm also glad that I get taxed so much so that, as you point out, my taxes can go towards helping the homeless. See, instead of vaguely complaining about the homeless, I try to do something about it!

The only hostility I've seen from the government is towards democrats. In fact, the one situation I felt danger in that I mentioned happened to be with the police. I would say that white conservatives have a huge leg up when it comes to talking to law enforcement here!

My wife and I just bought our house, and I'm incredibly excited for us to have kids which may go to one of the best schooling systems in the country. In our schools, they will learn that we need to protect the environment, gender and sex are separate concepts, and that more guns leads to more violence.

Well that's on you that you can't get along with people.
The problem is liberals moving to red states and not changing their ideologies. I live in a city that used to be conservative but has progressively gone downhill as more liberals came here and started electing liberals into leadership positions. My state itsself is blood red.
You are so very correct!
But why.  What does this get them
"I agree with you (and I do not at all agree with charging the attendant , to be clear), but you‚Äôve kinda just stumbled across the *why* of bail reform. 

In large city justice systems, where judicial processing is Kafka-esque level of slow, the argument goes that we should not be locking people up to await trial when that wait could be YEARS given how easily mistakes can be made (as we clearly see here) Especially if these people are presumed innocent until proven guilty. However what was happening is the DAs would give people like this attendant bail that they couldn‚Äôt afford, so off to rikers they went. 

Combine this with how gun ownership restrictions in large cities generally are enforced against the poorer (and typically minority) populations, given they tend to live in the parts of town where one might need a gun for protection, and suddenly you can see the absurd catch 22 so many poor folks find themselves in. 

Personally, I think the founders envisioned a world where they would rather a guilty man walk free than an innocent man deprived of freedom, and what we see here is a clear case of the contrary."

 > Biden‚Äôs attacks on our energy independence...

I'm out of the loop here.  What attacks are they referencing?"
How much could possibly be left in the SPR?
is your google broken?
"No, but I'm finding conflicting information.  Can you help me understand this article in regards to Biden and energy independence? 

This article is a huge mess.  The first paragraph has nothing to do with gas prices or the rest of the article.  Then the article claims Biden attacked our energy independence without explaining how, when, or what the impact was.  Then it runs a bit with how this is a benefit to Russia.  Then it suggests that Saudi Arabia is raising prices because of Biden  but fails to make a correlation to how he is involved in this decision.    

The article also links to another article (below)  which only references Biden as an agent who is fighting these rising prices.  I hope you can understand why I'm confused.  I really wish these articles were a little clearer.  If Biden is / has done something which causes gas prices to rise I would like to know what that is so I can have something to talk to my left leaning friends about.

"I dunno, to much information is flowing freely. Can't be having that now."
This is only the beginning. Many living near flood zones will ultimately need to self insure.
Wish the State would stop bailing out the market and do something more wffective
Land is much more finite then most other resources.
"I'm going to suggest the problem isn't with insurance it is with building construction. The building you need in Florida should be much different than Chicago or California. Florida needs to look at making buildings that can withstand the weather events that are naturally occurring in Florida. 

The free market should assist here. If you have a hurricane and flood resistant home your insurance costs should be much lower. 

So building houses that are on raised platforms or living spaces that start on the second floor should be the norm. Then building storm resistant designs that can deflect and sustain high wind loading again should be the norm. 

As for the politics DeSantis feels he has Florida locked up. He knows if Florida gets an insurance bailout it will hurt him in her other states. So he is going to avoid anything that looks like Florida is getting something at the expense of other states. That's just politics."
"Well, if you need to rebuild the property every 4 years, the insurance needs to be at least 25% of the cost to rebuild.  As building costs rise, so will insurance rates."
"Living in Miami, this is becoming a real hot button topic for the State. In another sub, people were asking why vote Trump over DeSantis. This is it. DeSantis is choosing culture wars over potential statewide economic issues and it‚Äôs reflecting in the current national polling numbers between him and Trump."
"""This week, the state-backed Citizen‚Äôs Property Insurance voted to move forward on a 14.2% rate increase for its 1.2 million policies. The rate request is above the statutory guidelines of 12%, indicating the pressure on the state-backed carrier.  
Under former Governor Rick Scott, Florida paid insurance companies to take policies off the books from Citizens to help stabilize the market and reduce exposure for the state-backed insurance carrier of last resort. Florida could start to do the same thing now; however, Governor Ron DeSantis and the legislature have not indicated that is something they are considering right now.""

Paying more for home insurance wouldn't be so frustrating if the insurance companies actually paid when damages occur but they don't or they take ages to make the pay out. And we're losing more and more carriers every year in Florida, this is an increasingly bad problem in a state where we're gaining so many new residents every day."
"I for one thinks that the FEMA has no business of offering flood insurance.  If it got flooded, people should just pay up themselves or move.  I‚Äôm sick of paying for these rich people"

"As somebody who used to build houses long time ago, they houses are built stout. During Andrew everybody remembers roofs being literally peeled back right? Well no if that happens your foundation is going with it. Trusses are tied into rebar and concrete in the walls that goes into the foundation. The garage doors have so much bracing now it‚Äôs insane. 

As far as second stories, not a big fan of those down here. Leads to a bigger profile for wind damage and I have seen a lot of damage to the sides of houses after this years hurricanes. Single story houses no problem, second story siding and paneling ripped off."
"Not gonna happen. The entire home insurance industry in Florida is on the brink right now. With the weather there, payouts are almost certain yearly if not multiple times a year. Insurance companies continually raise rates to cover that cost. 

Not to mention all the insurance fraud going on across the state, specifically regarding roof repair."
"That's the problem. Insurance companies have been leaving the state or going insolvent. Free market is working as it should. You can't compel businesses to lose money on a losing proposition. DeSantis and Co. passed laws making it harder for homeowners to sue insurance companies, to allow companies to sell policies exempting roofs, and to require all Florida homeowners to carry flood insurance starting June 2023. The insurance companies aren't buying it. Or rather, they ain't selling, at least in Florida. 

Many homeowners are getting non-renewals or renewals for $7K. Now they gotta fork over more cash for flood insurance to the tune of several thousands more. 

To add salt to the wound, property taxes are increasing as well. I've been following the insurance crisis there for a few years now, and I really think if DeSantis and the GOP can't fix this quickly this is going to crash Florida's housing market. There's no way for most people to afford these kinds of premiums."
what is the magic solution to floods? there is none.
DeSantis is using culture wars to distract from the fact that he is working to further enrich his very rich donors at the expense of the people of Florida.
Choosing national issue over state issue is reflecting negatively in national polls....yeah I don't think that's why.
Not as many rich as you think.  Owning a house does not mean you're rich
What does that have to do with flood insurance in Florida?
He made an executive order raising your dog food prices
Seriously. Fly over even the most dense parts of the country and 80% of what you see is undeveloped land
Ah yes.  Endless fucking suburbia.
"But that's newer construction, right? There are still plenty of older houses around, plus trailer parks, plus structures on the barrier islands. Insurance is about spreading the risk cost out amongst many people, so if there are a bunch of trailers, newer houses built to stricter standards are also going to pay more (the riskier homes may pay more more, but everyone will pay some more).

The ""free market"" solution is that insurance rates in the riskiest places go up so high only the super wealthy can afford to live there. But the super wealthy are going to be connected enough to make sure they don't pay their fair share.

It's a complex problem with many connected pieces - some more nefarious than others."
Florida's housing market needs to crash.  It is a massive bubble.
"As a Florida homeowner it‚Äôs nuts. I shouldn‚Äôt be required to be buy flood insurance, my house is not any flood plan and one of the reasons I bought my property is because it is on the ‚Äúhigh ground‚Äù. If my house floods then we got way bigger issues in Florida.

As for the roofs, I blame the hack roofing companies for it. Door to door free roof inspections that would always find an issue that they immediately go after insurance for. Not every roof replacement was because of storm damage, most are due by age (my roof needs replaced soon because of age, house built in 2002)."
"Uh, maybe fix your water management so your city stops subsiding. 

The sea level isn't rising to swallow Miami.  Miami is sinking because they drain all the surface water into the ocean, and pump everything out of the aquifer dissolving the bedrock.  Sink holes aren't caused by an overabundance of water."
Shhh.  You're not supposed to notice that.
"All major polling currently shows the economy as the leading issue on GOP voter‚Äôs minds ~30%. Social issues are polling between 5-10%. Trump is going to pound on DeSantis for this (and his backing of Ukraine) once DeSantis confirms he‚Äôs in the running. Especially if the housing market gets hit, voters in Miami, Gainesville, Jacksonville, Orlando, Ft Lauderdale are all expected to be significantly more exposed than the national average. That‚Äôs why OPs article holds water (pun intended). DeSantis is walking a tightrope. Either way, I‚Äôd be happy if he or Trump win, but prefer Trump. DeSantis opens himself up to more scrutiny (warranted). Both can take the national election and end the current sh*tshow, however, which is all that matters rn."
But stop building or rebuilding in a flood plain or at sea level.
"This is Reddit, land of the beleaguered Barista. People on this site think having a car that starts twice in a row makes you ‚Äúrich‚Äù."

Which is why I don't understand why people keep packing themselves into cities."
So what
Don‚Äôt get my hopes up. It‚Äôll actually make a fucking house affordable again.
I believe Florida has had the highest housing price increases in the nation over the last 3 years.   Some homes on the coast have been flipped by speculators 2 or 3 times since 2020 at more than double the original prices.   Higher interest rates and this correction to accurate insurance rates will nip some of this speculative fervor.
"That's a city water management issue...Want to get mad? Look up how much water revenue (money from water meters) actually goes to fixing infrastructure. Most cities steal from the water fund for pet projects, I work in the water industry and see it in almost every city."
That's like half of Florida. The other half is swampland.
"Yeah, they should have built/bought in the mountains of Florida instead"
Probably for work.
Because there‚Äôs no infrastructure in the country? Lmao
For now it's because that's where economic growth is. Eventually more land will be developed. I don't think most people realize how much room there is to use up in this country. We could easily have a sustainable population of over 1 billion. Even if you ignore farmland there's tons of timber just waiting to be cleared
"Property taxes. 

If you can't pay the government they steal your house. So people move to the cities to find work. It's all by design. 

The government doesn't want you living in the middle of nowhere raising animals and growing your own food because they want you to make money they can tax. They also help the big corporations like Tyson bully all the small ranch competition out of business. 

So many Americans have lost their ancestral home over the generations to property tax. The banks would rather sit on an empty decaying house than give it back to the renter/homeless person they stole it from. 

That's why we're all in the cities."
"Hello, I am a student and am interested in getting into the water industry in the future, If you don't mind could you help me out a bit regarding qualifications, degrees, opportunities, etc."

"And how much of the labor pool in those small towns can support the tech company?

The only reason you‚Äôve seen them move to smaller cities like Boise or Salt Lake City is because the local talent pool wa a large enough to justify opening a small office, and then they slowly, over the course of several years, moved more of the company over there."
"Let me guess.  LA?  New York? Or some other major city where the people constantly complain about high taxes, high crime, crappy schools, bad traffic, and unaffordable rent prices?"
"Other companies have done this with great success in the past, they basically build a massive compound for the employees to live. Disney is a past example, I think Elon Musk is working on one currently in nowhere Texas."
"Moving a company into a small town causes an immediate boom that lasts for decades.  

Schools are needed.  Civic services.  Small businesses (restaurants, bars, etc.).  Those are all jobs.  And the salaries of the employees spending in that town lifts the economics of everyone.  Not to mention the tax revenues."
Nope actually
"Yes but those jobs usually show up there for a reason.  Silicon Valley didn‚Äôt spring up in farmland just because it was a nice place, there was a lot of technical government contracting work nearby so companies could pull talent from there, plus state government tax incentives."

Where do they find these people. Paying more for quality sure but 25% to feel better about a farmer not selling carbon credits what a scam."
"> In its research, it found that consumers are willing to pay at least 24% more for environmentally friendly sustainable options in retail.

Beef prices are already too high and you expect me to believe that?


[Press X to Doubt.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ys9orzlFxAA)"
Even if the public was willing to pay. Packer/Tyson are pretty good at screwing over the cow/calf guys and keeping any premiums in their own pockets.
"Give us the option, if it's so much better people will pay for it. If not, so be it."
I'm a consumer.   I find this premise ridiculous.

"No Democrat prosecutor will ever bring charges against DoucheBragg.

That's the Democrat game: let your own side walk on everything, but hold Republicans accountable for pillow tags and such."
"As the article points out, Bragg would have to be charged by the DA office he heads.  Good luck with that.

Losing his license?  Does anyone honestly believely the NY Bar would pull his license? The only way Bragg could be punished is at the Federal level, and that is highly unlikely"
"Lol, not going to happen, however this whole charade proves how incompetent the left is, keep up the good work"
Bragg is too busy prosecuting people protecting themselves after getting shot to worry about details like this.
"Let's see the indictments and let's present the evidence.
  
As the left have suddenly remembered - *no one is above the law* (when it's not one of them of course) - but they've forgotten that *no one is a target* of the law either.
  
Prosecute the crime not the person.
  
It's fine to charge Trump (or anyone) with a crime if you have reasonable evidence.  It is also fine to be suspect of this specific DA who ran for election with a promise to target Trump, and who has not prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law in all of the cases under his remit.
  
In short, if due process shows that Trump is guilty, then so be it.  He should suffer the consequences of his actions.  If due process reveals this DA to be acting in a political fashion, then he should be castigated and removed from office."
Of course. The Left would have it no other way. This whole thing is a farce
"Innocent until proven guilty, I thought? Or is that only for Dems"

"I love California. Beautiful weather, beautiful state. But it is so sad to see that elites living there who prospered due to its location are now making it impossible to live in because of the bad governance. We can see it being ruined right in front of our eyes. There are many who can't move out for various reasons and they are probably sad and extremely frustrated with the way things have gone. Several decades ago, this was the place to move to. Maybe one day it can return to its past glory after it hits rock bottom and the elites decide to abandon it."
I left last year after living there my whole life and would never vote blue.  My parents and 2 close friends also left and don‚Äôt vote blue.
"500,000 sounds like a lot but that‚Äôs like 1.2% of the population."
But how many moved to California during that same period?
Replaced by immigrants? I‚Äôd imagine they do not know the number of undocumented people there.
You're looking at one of them!
"Wait until Newsome signs the bill enacting reparations, the second great exodus will happen.  CA will have no middle class left.  It's a joke."
The blue state virus is spreading.

I was one of them. Hello Idaho!
I helped.
I'll bet they're glad they did.
"you'd think someone would say, ""gee, maybe something's going wrong."" but they don't, they're too damn arrogant."
Liberals screwed up Cali and will now move to other states to try screwing them up also.
These are rookie numbers. You got to pump those numbers up.
Add to that the number of people who refuse to visit there anymore.
If they turn Newsome into the next president . . .
Progressive paradise.
Way more than that.
Moved out of state to ruin more of them
"Politics aside, that place needs to deflate a little. Most people live in the arid southern third of the state, and there‚Äôs simply not enough fresh water to sustain the population there long term. The Colorado river compact is ridiculous. And that‚Äôs before we even talk about their agricultural operations‚Ä¶."
Census says 500k people have moved to TX between 20-22. LOL
"I'll be honest, I'd entertain moving to California if 2 conditions were met:

1. All their anti-2A laws rolled back 
2. Their housing wasn't a disaster 

All other things can be managed and dealt with, but those two are pretty much dealbreakers. Can't own a home, can't defend myself? Why bother."
Go back.  We don't want you in Florida.  You think you're based and smart?  Prove it by fixing California.
"They exported their crazy to red states, unfortunately"
"To put in context, there are about 12 million people in the LA Metro area and 39 Million in the entire state. 500k is not even 1%."
"Well said. California was a great place to live for the middle class until the elites moved in and tried to find a ‚Äúhigher purpose.‚Äù When money comes easily to them by preying on future generations, people need something to do and hence we have wokeism."
Still stuck here. My entire extended family and I are red. I've never voted blue. Eff that!
"Yeah well Arnold Schwarzenegger calls himself a republican, so that doesn't carry much weight."
"500,000 sounds like a lot because it is a lot.

That‚Äôs over 50% of the population of Wyoming."
"Look at it this way. Kansas City, MO has 508,000 people.  California lost an entire city."
"Hold up... 1% of the population is absolutely huge.... Are you trying to say that's small???

If you want to claim that your state is the political holy land then maybe it's not so good to see that 1 in every hundred people are leaving..."
Most of Mexico.
"They were avoiding population loss via immigration for a long time, however the last census their population was reduced."
"Bloody hell, this has been keeping me up at night

"The people leaving aren‚Äôt liberals. 

I left California at the end of 2020."
"Except the 5 million republicans in Cali, they're welcome."
"Need the tax dollars, though. It's tricky."
"If he is somehow the nominee in 2024, we will make fucking sure he loses."
"I predict California housing will get worse before it gets better.  The state needs to collapse more.

One day, when there is reduced enthusiasm, you will eventually get people thinking ""what can I do to get people to move here.""  As long as there's high demand, they just have every incentive not to fix it.  Everyone who buys in there is a newly minted anti-housing advocate.  There's NIMBYism everywhere, but in other places you sometimes get people who think: My property would be *more* valuable if this area was better developed as more people will want to move in.  That has worked for people in eg Nashville.  Nobody in California has thought that for a long time."
College indoctrination after WW2 slowly turned the tide. Now these people are in positions of power.
"Californians get a bad rap, I suppose rightfully so as the majority keep voting in the crazy leftists. But so many good people who are against the insanity of the government live there and are powerless to stop the majority and unable or stubbornly unwilling to leave. I got grief from a few for leaving saying i should stay and fight, but going down with the ship was not something I was willing to do."
"I would still take Arnie over Newsom or Governor Moonbeam any day of the week. A DeSantis would never win in CA, so you take what you can get."
"Which begs the question of why senatorial representation is equal across states. 

Two senators from Wyoming represent the same number of people as had moved from California in 2022."
That‚Äôs almost the full population of Wyoming. In California that number isn‚Äôt a lot. It‚Äôs all relative.
To put it in perspective Kansas City would be the 7th largest city in California.
"so how do you feel about Texas having 435k-471k people leave the state (1.5%~) comparatively 

?"
"I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs inconsequential. Our state is over populated so losing some population isn‚Äôt going to hurt us, it‚Äôs actually going to be a positive. 

Everyday people from around the world move here and can‚Äôt afford it. It drives up our housing costs and adds to the homelessness.  As long as we keep the highly skilled part of our population, which we are, this is a good thing. 

>	If you want to claim that your state is the political holy land then maybe it‚Äôs not so good to see that 1 in every hundred people are leaving‚Ä¶


When did I make this claim?"
I don't care how they vote. I care about how they destroy local housing markets.
As long as they vote for conservatives in the primaries. We don‚Äôt need any more RINOs in office.
We left NY for TN in 2019 and I've been told I'm the type of yankee they dont mind moving here. I say when one of me comes down they should send 2 liberals to NY.
There's going to be 3 less in a few months right here.
"I would like to be optimistic but I am not.  The election of Fetterman in Pennsylvania (a relatively purple state) tells me that  the Dems could get someone in a coma elected president.  Biden is senile, racist, piece of shit and yet here we are.  Newsome is good looking and appeals to women.  I see him as being infinitely more electable than Biden, Harris, or Fetterman."
"Pretty much, although it doesn't help that housing is spiking in places like Nashville too. It's very expensive there and Nashville does not pay well enough to support it"
Makes sense. Why do you think they started with the indoctrination post WW2? We were fighting the soviets. You‚Äôd think that would be period when commies wouldn‚Äôt find support anywhere in America.
"There's a shitload of Republicans in California. Just like anywhere else though, blue rules in the population centers. I get a kick out of my friends to the north east of me up towards Chico and Redding that are all in on the ""State of Jefferson""."
"Because it allows small states equal representation in government. 

It at least gives them a chance for representation to fight for their way of life, and keep from being completely drowned out by huge population centers."
Here's an idea- what if we created a.... house..... in congress which was....representative... of the actual population of each state?  Do you think that would be helpful?
"Which begs the question why people like you don‚Äôt understand what Federalism is and how we‚Äôre a Republic of States. 

Or rather why you understand perfectly well what that is and want to destroy it for political purposes."
"How many people are coming in?

California has a net positive exodus."
"Yeah, that's a big issue. Ask Idaho natives what they think of Californians of any political persuasion."
"Or increase the value of the homes in the area? 

You can‚Äôt have it both ways."
No one likes RINOs
That‚Äôs my hot take is that the NY and CA exodus is mostly pensioners who sold their homes and are looking to make their dollar go further. That‚Äôs my plan although the rate NY is headed I may not make retirement and leave sooner.
They are not voting for the person just the party. You could put a tophat on a skeleton run it as a Democrat and probably win with the type of people voting lately.
We fought *with* the commies in WW2.
"Well a person can dream, 

but it would be great if some of those republicans who can move, can move to purple states for sometime and turn it red and make CA irrelevant in national politics. Then blue people will start moving out of CA since they can't get the power. Then move back and take CA. Its is just a dream. I know people don't work that way."
I live north in a town close to Vacaville- I moved from SF last year and couldn‚Äôt be happier where I am now. Much more sane! Love seeing more ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù- and by that I mean anti-Biden sentiment!
"so I see you've chosen moving goalposts as your response

you said 1% was a bad thing, that it's a bad thing if 1 out of every 100 leave. jk that's no longer relevant.

anyway I've contributed to the net exodus in general. Left Texas, California, and the entire country. good luck y'all"
Have had it both ways for literal centuries.  It's called a local economy
The left likes them.
"We left because we wanted to be able to afford a life. Since relocating we got married had a baby bought a house sold it, bought a nicer house which back on long Island I'd never dream of being able to own."
"What an odd way to frame ""the majority of voters don't like our policies""."
There is a substantial vote against factor as well.
"Would be nice, but I moved to AZ and look what happened here last Nov. I went from Newsom to Hobbs. Lord help us."
Got that State of Jefferson energy brewing inside ya yet?
"Sorry I wasn't very clear in my original comment.

Yeah, the reason to bring it up is not that people are leaving but to show the net difference."
So you‚Äôre against the value of your home going up?
The left finds them convenient. But they certainly don't like them.
Something‚Äôs percolating! LOL

Governments don‚Äôt represent people anymore because the elites now believe people are essentially disposable and replaceable with migrants. Why value what you can just replace. We are essentially tax cattle now.

"Hm, isn't this article from the 14th of february **2019**, a false one at that ? Does no one even click on the article ? What's OP's goal in posting this exactly ?"
"A meme is essentially a political cartoon, which are considered parody and/or satire. Both of those have been repeatedly upheld in the US as protected free speech. See Hustler v Falwell. The recent conviction of Douglass Mackay here in the US should be a chilling case as it should have been protected parody as anyone would ‚Äúreasonably be understood‚Äù that voting (in 2016!!!) via text was completely bogus.

The EU (and UK) have no protections on free speech, so while this is 100% legal based on their system of government, it is lamentable in their discriminatory decisions‚Ä¶"

And to achieve that vision they will spend your life as they deem necessary."

"""in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary""

That language completely eliminates freedom and allows people in power to silence anyone they want."
"Free speech is still not inherent to either political system (EU and the UK). EU & UK citizens only have the right to free speech as given to them by the government, aka man. Those rights can just as easily be taken away by an new law or an edit to the language of an existing one. The US Constitution is based on natural rights as provided by God, not by man, where free speech is institutionalized and enshrined. 

The EU had to define ‚Äúparody‚Äù in order to make it legal not to infringe upon their previous vague copyright law. You must, essentially, prove your innocence by remaining within the strictures of their definition of parody. In the US, by contrast, a copyright holder must prove guilt on the side of the parody writer to incur libel and other copyright violations.

There is no ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù here, simple logic and deduction."

"What a world salad just to say nothing in the end. You say that the EU and UK have no protections on free speech, yet right afterwards talk about how the right to free speech was given to them by the government. Do you think it is any different in the US just because it's written in the constitution ? Well, guess what, either way the EU has the European Court of Human Rights, ever heard of it ? Ever heard of the European Convention on Human Rights ? Ever heard of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights for a broader area ? Did you have any idea that France too had Freedom of Speech written in its constitution ? Or do you see the French constitution as inferior to the US one therefore dismiss it ? Did you know that most countries around the world, even in Africa, have Freedom of Speech written in their constitutions ? Or does it only matter when it's written in the US constitution ? 

> The US Constitution is based on natural rights as provided by God

This made me laugh. What are you going to do if the government tries to change the 1st Amendment in 5 or 50 years ? Do you think God is going to smite them to oblivion with a lightning bolt ? How is the US constitution any different than other countries' constitutions ? Or do you just feel superior because it's your countries therefore dismiss all the others' ? Do you think God personally bled to write the US constitution in sacred blood therefore it's infallible and inviolable ? 

Did you know that despite all your rambling, according to 2020 GSDI statistics there are 27 to 29 countries ahead of the US in freedom of speech, as it shares the 13th row with 2 other countries ? And guess what, 19 of those countries are in Europe, 20 if you bother counting Iceland as European, which I didn't just to please you.

The EU didn't have to define ""parody"" in any way. It already had all the protections needed in place thanks to freedom of speech laws, amendments and articles. The EU made the Parody Act just to reinforce those in stronger ways. 

So yeah, you are spreading horseshit and misinformation and I really have to ask why. Why all this hostility towards the UK, the EU, and Europe in general ? There is no simple logic and deduction, there is just pettiness and malicious intent, either intentionally or ignorantly. Did you even bother clicking on the article that OP posted ? Did you even bother checking the fact that it's an article that is over **FOUR** years old yet no freedom of speech whatsoever was breached, either due to a meme or any other parody ? Did you even bother making basic research before spouting all your nonsense or were you counting on the fact that nobody would even bother ? 

Are you here just to sow dissent ?"
Which case is this? I haven‚Äôt seen it.

I used to work in a very small family run office with a guy who was always itchy it was super awkward talking to him you'd often wonder what he was doing. It was about a year of this before him and his girlfriend had a massive falling out (his fault) and she outted his proclivity for diapers to the office. He was later fired for snorting pills in the bathroom.

"After an episode of C.S.I. I learned about adult ""babies"" there are actual daycares for these weirdos"
They are trying to get rid of the stigma so biden can come out in the open about wearing them.. hehe
I miss hearing the stories of the State Hospitals back in the day. Mental health should have never been allowed to become a business.
"FYI, this was an April Fools joke. Or at least that's what r/seattlewa told me."
"It started when it became taboo to shame people. It started with people being weird in their own homes/bedrooms, now were expected to celebrate people's degeneracy and you have actual adults pretending to be animals and wearing diapers and shit like that."
"Those adults are known as the ""woke left"" ü§£"
Make shaming these lunatics GREAT AGAIN!
What‚Äôs a crinklebottom and is it as funny as it sounds?
What a wild ride that story was haha‚Ä¶ loved the ending.
"Careful, people who snort pills in the office bathroom often face a terrible stigma."
"Careful, people who snort pills in the office bathroom often face a terrible stigma."
That sub is incredible. I cannot believe it‚Äôs not a joke. But it isn‚Äôt.

"This is what annoys me about the people saying they don't care what people do in the privacy of their own homes, because things never just end in their own homes, they carry that weirdness with them everywhere, and continually push for stuff like this to be normalized."
Not at all. Read the article. Pretty much defines it.
"It's pretty much exactly what it sounds like. Also, and I'm not sure if it makes it better or worse, but ""crinklebottoms"" is actually their preferred title."
"I don‚Äôt wanna give that story a click. Well, time to nuke this planet from orbit."
"I don't blame Japan for looking out for Japan. They've got a history of antagonism with Russia regarding their Northern islands. If they side with a bullish but isolated Russia right now, they can potentially avoid trouble later if Russian expansionists start looking Eastward, or if China starts getting bullish and they need a mutual ally as a check.

The penalty for slighting the US, alternatively, is probably negligible."
"Russia saw an open door-- same admin, only weaker this time, as he did with Crimea. Let's get to the negotiating table, US voter's fault he gpt another part of Ukraine. Period."
That assumes Russia completely changes entirely and becomes trustworthy.
Not necessarily. An isolated Russia is just as subject to realpolitik as anyone. A lot of assholes can play nice when it benefits them.
At this point any one staying In New York take what you get should have left in 2020 with the rest of the smart people

Me? I keep $50k of ‚Äúoh, shit‚Äù money on hand at all times. I am fortunate that I have the capacity to do that. Most people do not. I suspect that this victim, who was himself shot in the process of being a hero, is going to be further victimized by medical bills and attorneys fees.

And people still wonder in this day and age why so few step in to do the right thing."
"‚ÄúPending further investigation‚Äù hopefully means they do a quick review and let innocence be innocence. In NY, it could mean ‚Äúwait for things to die down then stick it to them‚Äù

In other words water is wet. This is a standard motion made by every lawyer for every criminal defendant in the country. If they don‚Äôt its not on the record for appeal.
It is the first thing any component lawyer does with any trial anywhere ever.
Won‚Äôt happen. This judges loathes Trump.
"There is no chance the Dems allow this to be dismissed. They have pushed this knowing there is nothing.

Edit:  I completely understand that this is standard procedure. Simply stating the Dems would never dismiss, regardless of how weak and frivolous their charges are"
Wow some Harvard level lawyering there.
Isn't the statute of limitations waaaaay past expired?
"I have a hunch some of them will be.  Keep in mind the statute of limitations for crimes in New York has LONG since expired, the campaign finance one is the only one that can last, and John Edwards got off in a much more difficult case.  Trump doesn't even have to prove that it was a valid use of campaign funds, he just has to prove that Michael Cohen was a shitty enough attorney not to warn him what he was doing was illegal."
"having done a few court cases myself, including 2 federal, the first thing you throw out there is a motion to dismiss, even if it's unlikely to win. Sometimes it sticks.

It doesn't mean anything one way or another."
"Yes for the state charges, Bragg is trying some serious mental gymnastics to link this to a campaign finance violation where essentially Trump made an illegal contribution to himself. This would take the state misdemeanor and turn into a federal felony. Hillary faced the same crime and got a fine, John Edwards faced the same thing but no charges were brought forward."
Yep
"Exactly.  No matter what, you utilize your rights at every turn and you reserve your rights at every other turn."
Yeah I was going to say if your defense attorney doesn‚Äôt throw out a motion to dismiss at every opportunity then you should get yourself a new attorney
Not disagreeing. Just saying I don‚Äôt see any way any judge/court in NY will ever have this dismissed.
So did they make it 30 counts just to ensure the case takes as long as possible?
"He did such a great job of taking out corruption from 2016-2020, I'm sure they're really scared."
He didn't take out corruption last time.
The left won't let him win again. They will blatantly steal the election and make questioning it punishable by death. That is *if* there will be a 24 election by the time we get there.
"Building a moonbase for trips to Mars is kind of sweet- too bad the government is so focused on solving problems 140 million miles away instead of the shit show occuring here on earth.

Earth is flat!  lol jk
The answer is yes.  They had a CHS infiltrating the group up until last week.  She was going to be a witness for the defense even.
"Well Judge Kelly did allow prosecutors to take back a spreadsheet that had a hidden tab with chat logs from internal FBI discussions, exculpatory evidence that is covered by the Brady rule.  Not sure why the judge would not force the government to turn over exculpatory evidence as the law requires, but then the Rule of Law is broken and we live under 'lawfare' now."
At this point I just automatically assume yes.
Yes
They're posturing to run HC again... aren't they?
Nothing like having a fall guy for what's hopefully a landslide election.
"I'm sure there's no collusion between this judge and Bragg.

">	As fate would have it, Silicon Valley Bank CEO Greg Becker lobbied in 2018 to raise the asset bar on the annual Dodd-Frank stress tests from $50 billion to $250 billion. On May 24, 2018, when President Donald Trump signed ‚Äúthe biggest rollback of bank rules since the financial crisis,‚Äù SVB‚Äôs assets footed to $54 billion. By the end of last year, they had mushroomed to $212 billion.

>	Never mind that the rollback bill was signed by 33 Democrats in the House and 17 in the Senate.

Just what we need
That will do wonders for the economy.
lockdowns didn't help but the blatant corruption across-the-board would leave any country disheartened.
"Many great nations have suffered collapse; it's what happens afterwards that's not guaranteed. Some nations eventually bounce back, some don't, and some completely cease to be. 

We've got geography on our side to an extent; no one from Asia or Europe could ever realistically (re)colonize us. But that also means it would be a lot easier to get help to some areas rather than others if need be. Canada could be a springboard for foreign aid, and I doubt would be a threat at any point in the near future. Our Southern border will be an issue.

More importantly, though, is the sense of unity we fellow Americans have with one another. That is the glue that will hold us together when things get rough and if institutions fade. We don't necessarily need to have all the same values as we as a people used to, but unless we share enough of whatever else is out there to make us feel like our similarities outweigh our differences, we're screwed."
We know.  But no one is listening to us.
"Honest question, what are our nation's core values?  

It seems like the parties talk less about what we have in common and talk more about how we're different.  

Attitude is a reflection on leadership, and our leadership focuses on divisible language out of their own interests.  

So if the messaging from leadership isn't unified, why would we expect the population to be?"
Rome says hi.
I don't need a think tank to know this.
"Was it the carpet bobbing of Vietnam or the straight up failed from the start invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan?

Was it the enslavement of Africans or indentured servitude of the Irish and Easter Europeans?

Wait, wait was it the suppression of voting rights for non land owning males?

Bruh the  beauty of this country is reinvention, and if our time as hegemony is over then so be it. Let‚Äôs ride off into the sunset and spend time reinvesting in ourselves."
">Tucker said the declines made sense and blamed the government's COVID-19 lockdowns for the ""cultural crisis.""

Is Tucker really that clueless? Been happening for years and was kicked to hyperspeed by bathhouse barrys ""fundamental transformation"". A nation divided against itself cannot stand, and guess what?"
"Why do they only discuss the decrease in values and not the increase in others?

Seems like you have to consider the different parts within the whole picture."
I believe it. Just look at what's happening in Western society. It's starting to look like a Southpark episode. Rome is burning.
Also importing millions of people from third world countries didn't help the US
I hear this every ten years
Everyone has been saying this long before people at a think tank came up with it
"A country that turns on itself dies. That if a country turns away from what made it great, it will die. We are doing that now."
We‚Äôre at the ‚Äògood times make weak men‚Äô part of our country
"Blind trust or dogmatic patriotism in such a corrupt, near totalitarian police state as we are becoming is no better than being a foaming at the mouth liberal.

 After the January 6 hearings and the 40k hours of videos exonerating the shaman and others never made the mainstream news. After our police state threatened to coerce an untried vaccine at the cost of our jobs. Now they're trying to lock down our right to free speech on the internet with the new ""Tik'Tok"" bill.

I've lost faith in the institutions that I once held in high regard. To me, the FBI is just the KGB in my own language"
I refuse to let this country die without trying to turn it back in the right direction.
All thanks to the dedicated and diligent work of leftists. Why does everything they touch turn to shit?
LGBT - that‚Äôs what America stands for.  Wish it weren‚Äôt so.  üòïüá∫üá∏
"It began as America embraced secularism and gravitated away from religion. Truth be told, I‚Äôm not a guy who goes to church every Sunday myself‚Ä¶but still religious. Regardless, any of the major religions instill a sense of community and values into its constituents‚Ä¶something that is lacking. What we are seeing now, is broadly a result of a generation of people raised without the values that have helped shape mankind since the inception of modern theology"
but the rise of the Democrats‚Äô Communist empire
Yeah no shit. Conservatives have been saying this 20+ years
I think we got 100 years left as the country it is now. If we‚Äôre lucky.
"Good. If we can‚Äôt be a nation that believes in basic principles, then we don‚Äôt deserve to exist."
"Yeah. Things are likely going to get much worse before they get better. We could handle the bad economy, the hostile world, the inflation; what we can‚Äôt handle is how radical and hateful the left has become. Unreasonable, moronic, and fanatical."
"I think the western world is waking up to the realization that traditional values are neither very kind nor inclusive.

Our mentality is evolving beyond the judeo-christian group-think, and those systems no longer fit in a modern world.

The truth is if the judeo-christian religions and organizations don't grow with the times then they will gradually shrink until they are just a memory blowing in the wind across the ash heap of history."
Could?
Doesn‚Äôt require a think tank president to figure that out ‚Ä¶ the evidence is all around us
It was fun while it lasted.
thank god
As we know it maybe. But America itself isn‚Äôt going anywhere.
"Americans just arrested the leader of the opposition. Nicaragua and Libya, move over."
I think the answers are simple incentive marriage and traditional family‚Äôs by proving a social program to offer taxpayer money back to families. No one‚Äôs gonna stay single without kids if you can get an extra free $50k per year to have values
"Nope, America is no longer the world leader.  China has inch by inch, foot by foot, mile by mile, slowly and silently, taken over Africa, the Middle East, parts of Asia, South America, and the US by buying up farm lands, providing cheaper manufactured goods, thanks to slave labor, and building infrastructure. Plus, India and Russia are China's main allies, which means, the majority of the world's population already supports China as the new world leader over America."
India will be the next world power..
All of this is happening because none of you have enough faith in cryptocurrency. Wake up and make the switch today. Government ‚Äúregulated‚Äù money is a scam.
"Media companies profit at the expense of Unity. They make more money from sowing division and controversy. Unless we can remove the economic incentive to preach hatred and division, we‚Äôre doomed to fall."

There is a reason China encourages wokeness in the US but bans it in China; it's cancerous to a society.
Decline values? yall remember when we owned each other
..Duh?
Raise your hand if you did not see this in the middle 00‚Äôs
USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!
What ‚Äúvalues‚Äù do they think are the problem?
Just watched Jesus Revolution this week and was reminded that adults in the 60s/70s were equally convinced that ‚Äúkids nowadays‚Äù are morally bankrupt.  It‚Äôs standard fare for every generation to feel that way.
"yep, as long as we keep letting the liberals control the government and propaganda, its just going to keep getting worse and worse"
"A left leaning social media empire saying the right is our enemy and a right leaning local news empire saying the left is our enemy. Rent and housing costs are sky high, a minimum wage paying less than $8 an hour, education prohibitively expensive, a joke of a healthcare system and the only developed nation with 0 days of paid time off. No wonder values have gone out the window lol. No one can afford kids, trust the government or afford to eat. Covid accelerated it, but it was always heading this way."
And it started with the surrender of Afghanistan
I‚Äôm really hoping this isn‚Äôt news to any of you.
"current world political re-alignments, combined with domestic issues definitely suggest our decline is well under way and will likely accelerate from here."
"How can any country be expected when 33-50% of the people in the government are actively, intentionally working to subvert every system, standard, rule, and law in place to install a new system?

Conservatives typically play by and adhere to the systems in place, because they want to preserve what we already had. Leftists openly say that they don't play by the rules because they want an entirely new system to be put in place, so they see no reason to respect the system that it is already in place. It's literally a core tenant of Marxism to do everything in your power to subvert the system in place to bring it down.

Literally **none of us** should be surprised about this, Communists have literally been openly bragging about this since the cold war."
"What unity are you talking about lmao. The whole planet sees how 90% of Republicans and 90% of Democrats are at each others' throats, each thinking that the other is about to cause the collapse of their democracy and traitors to the nation. Everything about the USA is political now, and the elites and richest like it that way. From the most minuscule of issues to the biggest one, practically everyone is more concerned about sticking it to the other party than doing what's morally and ethically right."
"Remember that Rome nearly collapsed about once every 300 years and had a Civil War every 20 years (average) and was one of the longest-lasting empires of all time.

It's not just about falling. It's about getting back up."

We don't necessarily need to have all the same values as we as a people used to, but unless we share enough of whatever else is out there to make us feel like our similarities outweigh our differences, we're screwed.

We're screwed. The Gub'ment and media made sure of it and it is the major factor in the collapse. The total collapse is no longer a question of ""if"", but ""when"". China has already stopped using the US dollar, as soon as enough more countries do, we are toast."
"The highest gdp are bluest states I think tho with the largest population. They would probably band together while others like Oklahoma go bankrupt :/ unless of course they joined together and a state like Texas bailed them out for a reason. That's another thing most states are blue by population in the dentist areas. You'd basically need to stop a mass exodus of your most crucial work force. People won't stay somewhere that tramples on their rights or at least will go somewhere with better rights which is mostly what blue states have to offer including for free medical care coverage. 

 balkanization of the US would be terrible for many states including Hawaii, Rhode Island, or territories like Guam and Puerto Rico, too, because they're heavily dependent on aid from the federal gov. 

The collapse of the federal gov would be bad for everyone. It's not likely we'll lose our super power status as long as it doesn't collapse, either. Because of the massive and powerful military. Unless the military somehow imploded but I don't think the gov would let that happen either, because we give it lots of monies."
Did you say unity? I only relate to fellow conservatives.
"Because our opinions aren‚Äôt ‚Äúcool‚Äù or ‚Äúhip‚Äù or ‚Äúwoke‚Äù or whatever.  We are firmly entrenched now in full hedonism in our nation, actively attacking those who want to uphold decency or civility.  The left grew very angry when Trump was in office, because the coddling of the previous 8 years seemed to be falling out of favor.

I hate that it was a man of Trump‚Äôs suspect character that brought the rise out of them, and not someone who actually has morals.  It really doesn‚Äôt matter anyway, because they have now figured out how to make any election go in their favor."
"It's because saying we're losing ""our values"" is like complaining ""wokeness.""  It means whatever you want it to mean. It's completely unactionable except for self aggrandizing mental masturbation."
"This, tbh I‚Äôm not sure we can even agree on what ‚Äúconservative‚Äù values are. But more to the point on the topic as a whole, I hate that we look to the government for any sort of social guidance because that‚Äôs another step away from freedom. Yes Americas values are changing but the solution is not more governance."
"We don't have leaders, we have demagogues who scare us and keep us divided by any means to maintain their grip on power.

Politics is acting as if the worst possible motive, is the only possible motive, on every possible issue. If you disagree with me, it's not cause you've made an error in thinking, it's because you're evil intentions put us at odds in the war of good and evil, and my side is good 100% of the time by default.

There is no room for diplomacy or civility if you preach that the other side is pure evil. How can you work together if that means compromising with evil?

Many of histories worst horror stories where caused by ""good people"" who became convinced they where fighting ""evil people"". As Plato once said, ""This and no other is the root from witch the tyrant springs, when he first appears he is the protector"". this remains true to this day."
How is America a nation state? What makes us a common people? Fundamental questions that are impossible to answer nowadays
Loose fiscal policy and widespread corruption destroyed Rome.

Love of money?"
How‚Äôs the UK doing? Lmao.
"So what. You're not even in the US, so you are clueless as to what has changed in the USA."
I would say we are in the beginning of weak men make hard times
"Good times don't make weak men, bad times do not make strong men. Otherwise the various hellish conditions in deeply corrupt countries would be making, well, considerably stronger men than they are right now. And wealthier countries would be far weaker than they are.

Discipline makes strong men, and it's perfectly compatible with good times. Lack of resources and lack of discipline create weak men. It's just that often good times don't demand as much discipline, and people can end up letting it slide either for themselves or for their children. It needs to be artificially produced when external challenges are absent, which is part of what proper education systems include. 

This is also a problem when it comes to wealth, status, power which often overlap with good times. When it's too easy to win you don't learn as much from a lack of opposition."
"Weak men are now making hard times. I don't see anything getting better. The good times are ending. The weak men created by good times were the baby boomers, and they've passed that down to everyone after them. In the good times, a man could support a family and buy a home on one middle class income. People have to work harder for less than any time since the 1950s. The culture has been absolutely rotting in this country since the end of WW2, and accelerated to an ungodly rate in the past decade or two. We have already hit the peak of American prosperity and are long past it. Now it's just a question of what the bottom will look like and how long it will take to get there."
Good luck. Every time I try speaking up for normalcy and morality I get banned for hate speech for disagreeing with things that are destroying our society.
It's their plan.  Communism can only arise out of chaos.
"Cultural Marxists intended this. They found in the 30's that the United States would never have a ""worker revolution"" as Marx predicted. When trying to figure out why, it was due to our strong values. Instead of just bowing out and admitting they were wrong about a worker uprising, they went about subverting the values of the country to undermine such stability."
"Liberalism is a disease that destroys the mind. You can study California, New York, and see that it's rarely been treated."

What time period did America have great values by following religion?
"It's why God forbode idolatry. 

People need *something* to worship, but without God it is all empty. It's the theory of the ""God shaped hole."" 

Without God, they worship money or sex or status or whatever other hedonistic thing you can think of, and none of it is ever enough. You can have more money than you will ever be able to spend and still be unfulfilled and left wanting more.

Why else do all these octogenarian fucks in high level positions refuse to just retire and enjoy their 9 figure bank accounts? Nothing is enough, no amount of money or power satisfies them because they lack God."
"Unfortunately Rs have done crap to even stem the tide, much less make a difference. Oh, well, we did take ‚Äúthe high road‚Äù. So there‚Äôs that."
"No, I think there's plenty to be said about traditional values. Our problem is we're throwing out the baby with the bathwater and speeding towards new values that we're making up as we go along while shedding traditional values that clearly have merit.

There is everything kind and ""inclusive"" about wanting to have strong, loving families with both parents present. There is everything kind and ""inclusive"" about advocating for personal responsibility. There is everything kind and ""inclusive"" about advocating for personal liberty and smaller government.

""Inclusive"" in quotes because it's largely a leftist buzzword with a lot of bullshit attached to it."
"Cultural, political, and economic stability are vastly more important than this ""inclusivity"" and ""equity"" nonsense."
God's word doesn't conform to mankind. You have it backwards.
*Is
The evidence is in the news everyday. The lack of moral compass is disgusting.
You‚Äôre proposing MORE welfare?
"And more importantly than all of that, they've stopped using the dollar."
"Also, while America trips over itself to be ""inclusive"" by dumbing down all its standards and feminizing its men, China (and Russia) doesn't tolerate this shit."
"The number one culpit of this is, ironically, US companies. This is what happens when profit is by far, very far, the driving factor in decision-making. 

US companies could all move away production from the PRC to any country in South-East Asia, or Europe, or Africa, or even back to the US. The result of this though, would be one of two things : 1) Keep consumer prices the same or practically the same, but shareholders take a hit in profit. Or 2) Keep profit to at least the same, if not higher, by making all the difference in cost the consumers' responsability, thus making your 100$ NIKE's 300$ for example.

Guess which option they will choose 99% of the time."
"India has so many different languages, ethnic groups, and religions within its borders, it's going to be tough getting everyone on the same page. And their infrastructure is shit. I don't think India is going to be calling the shots anytime soon."

">yep, as long as we keep letting the liberals control the government and propaganda

You're correct and the so called ""republicans' are complicit and doing nothing to stop it, except complain. There is no left and right in DC, it's a uniparty masquerading as 2 parties to divide the population and achieve their agenda."
It started way back in the 80s-90s
Yes great comment and the fact that ppl can barely live adds to people not feeling tied to the land.  When a nation has imploded its very easy for a foreign army to roll in.  Very very easy.
"The whole planet sees our news cycle that has been proven over and over again to be a soap opera, no matter which side you view it from.

People love dumpster fires and freakshows, the media is delivering the goods hand over fist."

Couldn't agree more
"You say that's what China/Russia wants, yet half of this sub supports withdrawing any and all funds from the Ukraine-Russia war. Some of the most extreme ones want to withdraw from NATO altogether. You know what's more concerning though, is that politicians are actively advocating for either one or both of these things and they have a good deal of support."
"That's clearly one of them, although it's more a sign that people don't value much other than luxury, status, or self-preservation depending on where they are in terms of financial stability. Since money is never an end in itself, only useful generally for attaining other things."
"Yeah I agree, actually"

"> Liberals don‚Äôt accept me and neither do conservatives.

You are personally accepted by conservatives. Conservatives are by and large the most tolerant group when it comes to people holding different opinions. If you're talking about accepting your political positions, your positions at odds with conservatives are obviously not going to be celebrated. It also doesn't help that moderates in the Republican Party have been hijacking the party while being a minority (Conservatives make up 80% of the Party, yet very little conservative positions are championed by the party). 

In a coalition there should be give and take among your coalition members. As in moderates on occasion should support more conservative agenda items to show support with their political allies. But for the last several decades it has been very one sided, where moderates use blackmailing of leaving the coalition to ""work with Democrats"" if they don't get their way. McCain being the prime example of such a platform. Then McCain acted surprised and butt hurt that conservative held him with disdain.

>the answer lies somewhere in the middle

And the left thinks the answer lies somewhere on the left. And conservatives think the answer somewhere on the right. Shocker. Now there is some truth that finding the ""truth"" about a given topic is found somewhere in the middle. As each side will spin the facts, narratives, and reporting to bias conclusions. Thus a wise person will assess the biases of the source and then use that to adjust for the conclusions of what is being read. That isn't the same thing as thinkin the ""answer"" is somewhere in the middle. That is incredibly nebulous and is also highly manipulated. As if the left keeps moving the Overton Window to the left (as they have been doing) you by default will find yourself moving to the left, not seeking solutions in the ""middle"".

>Most people also aren‚Äôt willing to compromise

Note that moderates are just as guilty. You are also ""not in the middle"" as you think. Most moderates hold some positions all over the spectrum, they aren't just some happy medium between the two political coalitions. As in on some level you do understand that hey when it comes to X issue you believe that one side of it has a correct take on it.

A person within our system of government/voting should take the time to find what *priorities* matter to you. As in maybe you think promoting families is the most important issue, but you're for more gun control. But gun control is kind of a low priority for you. Republican Party would 100% be a no brainer for this. Figure out your priorities and you will find which Party best suits your goals. You will also find that if you join a coalition, helping coalition allies with their goals will mean they are more likely to support you with yours goals. If you tell them to stick it up their ass (like McCain did numerous times) they aren't likely to be excited to help you with your priorities."

I think this is actually where my distaste with politics begins.

I'm not sure if that's entirely true. While on some issues I am certainly more left or right *leaning*, I have yet to come across an issue that I *entirely* agree with one side on.

I believe that my destiny is in my own hands, and that I have free will to do anything I want. My actions have consequences that are fully mine to own. I am also on the opinion that if you follow a religious book and preach it, you should need to follow 100% of its tenets, not just those you find convenient.

"> think this is actually where my distaste with politics begins. I believe that the only productive thing political parties and factions do is divide people

Which is what George Washington thought, which is why he was against political parties.

The issues is in a system such as ours, it's a necessary means in implementing change. You need to build a coalition to promote the cause/agenda you wish to see implemented. Organized political causes are much more successful than spontaneous political causes.

Conservatives do view politics/political parties as a necessary evil. Similar to guns, war, and the death penalty. These are not binary issues. Do we wish they didn't need to exist? For the most part. But the alternative is much, much worse.

>so I don't even want to play the game to begin with

No one wants to play the game. Well the left does seem to treat politics like a religion, so many on the left might want to. This is like saying, ""Hey I don't want to have to work a job and feed myself."" Well, it's no fun and you wish you didn't have to. But it's kind of a fact of reality whether or not you want to or like it.

A Stoic Principle (going back to Ancient Greece and later Rome) is that you have little control over what goes on in the world (as you are only a single person), but you do have control over how you react to it.

>I will vote but what I care more about than the letter next to their name is the candidates' quality of character and their values.

You will never know their quality of character. Only what you think their quality of character is. The only thing you know for certain is how they present themselves or what values they champion. Politicians are professional liars, especially when it comes to dressing up themselves. The vast majority of them are lawyers, they are not an actual sampling of the average American. Law Students spent their time in college not learning law (that's what cramming for the bar exam is for), but learning how to manipulate people towards a conclusion you want them to have.

To put simply, we would all want trustworthy and high quality candidates. The problem is the people willing to become politicians and go through all that nastiness are unlikely to be of good of character as you would hope for.

>I'm not sure if that's entirely true. While on some issues I am certainly more left or right leaning, I have yet to come across an issue that I entirely agree with one side on. There are also some issues that I am also pretty neutral about, or am simply not educated enough on the subject to hold a position.

This is typically because you haven't done enough research to understand the two sides. Surface level reads of subject might lead you to believe that. Also note that the ""sides"" hold a spectrum of beliefs and aren't just holding the Party Line.

So for instance Abortion. Pro-life hold a whole bunch of positions that do account for exceptions for abortion. You wouldn't know that based on how the media portray it. Gallup yearly polling has a break down of actual implementation of law and how Americans support it.

- No restrictions on abortion at all.
- Few restrictions on abortion (late term abortions type restrictions only).
- Few exceptions for abortion (rape, serious birth defects, incest)
- No abortion (though this is nearly unanimous that if the life of the mother is truly in danger, they will allow that exception. But this is actually not common at all).

There is your ""spectrum"" of positions. Pro-life Includes the bottom two, and pro-choice includes the top two. As people in the ""few exceptions"" category found the Roe v. Wade status quo to be abhorrent as well.

Being apolitical is a neutral term, but it's also one that hasn't bothered to invest in the issue (doing the time, research, and evaluation of it). Most Americans are apolitical on a whole host of issues. The problem with being apolitical is that it means you are easier to manipulate on the issue."
Non-policy is the catch. You can‚Äôt bemoan the loss of morals when you actively put someone in who has none.
"Seems to me that my sister's experience is worse than my mother or my grandmothers. You say that you're ""able"" to go to college, but women were able to do that in my mom's and grandmother's generations, most chose not to. Now it seems like women today are pretty much screwed over if they don't have a college degree, so they have to put themselves through the expense and stress of college for a job that isn't really that great."
"Women have been going to college for centuries, and they started entering the workforce in the 50s after WW2. Was your mother not allowed to go attend college or did she choose not to? Because you're right that in the 60s, it wasn't as common for women to attend college. But more often than not, it was a choice rather than a restriction. 

But now that you've brought it up, isn't it true that nowadays, the cost of attending college is many times higher (even in terms of real GDP/adjusted for inflation), while the quality of higher education and value of college degrees have both gone down?"

"> Personally I'm neither an Atheist nor am I deeply Religious, but I don't need a book to tell me what to do and what not to do.

Some people justify their abhorrent behavior or deeds on the religion they follow, and hide behind it like cowards, not taking full responsability for their own actions.

Many many...MANY... more people hide their abhorrent behavior behind a collectivist ideology, claiming it is ""for the good of the people"" while resulting in those people's suffering and eventual death. Far more than religious people.

>I believe that my destiny is in my own hands, and that I have free will to do anything I want.

That philosophy brought to you by Judeo-Christian principles and enshrined by Western civilizations into law, also influenced and written in the shadow of Judeo-Christian principles. 

>My actions have consequences that are fully mine to own. I am also on the opinion that if you follow a religious book and preach it, you should need to follow 100% of its tenets, not just those you find convenient. 

No arugument there. But I also need obvious non-believers to stop referencing the Bible, God or religion when it is expedient (i.e. Nancy Pelosi). If you don't follow the religion then you don't get to use it as an arguing point.

>I hope that one day, in either 10 or 10.000 years, we find concrete proof of the existance of some higher powers, and maybe even interact with them.

You don't seem to understand the concept of ""faith"". It takes zero faith to believe something that you can see with your own eyes. Do you date people on that premise, that I can only date someone if I 100% know every facet of their personality? No, you have to take a leap of ""faith"" on some things.

>That'd mean that the entire human race would have a definite goal to strive towards.

Tell me a greater goal than working to live up to the Ten Commandments. Most people haven't even gotten close."
Just calling a spade a spade.
"You raise some good points. It is indeed a necessary evil, and that‚Äôs why I still vote, even if I am sometimes undecided until literal days before election day. 

However, and I am aware that this will never happen, it would be nice to see a candidate independent of a political party with some decent ideas actually get traction in elections. However, I think a lot of voters are afraid of candidates who lean independent - at least with an R or a D next to someone‚Äôs name, you understand the overall jist of their beliefs or at least what they *pretend* to believe. It‚Äôs less unpredictable. I understand why people follow party lines, it‚Äôs just not something I personally do.

Since we‚Äôre on the topic of abortion, I suppose I lean more left, however I do not like the ‚Äúcelebration‚Äù of abortion that the left tends to make it out to be. Abortion should *not* be celebrated and only be done as a last resort after counseling and all options have been communicated to the patient. I think it‚Äôs morally wrong in all cases. However, I also believe that an individual‚Äôs bodily autonomy trumps my personal values on the subject. I guess that would make me pro-choice, but only in cases of the first few weeks of pregnancy (perhaps until end of first trimester). I suppose the closest view that would put me in your spectrum is the second point, but it‚Äôs a lot more nuanced than you make it out to be."
"Surely it does, why else would you be vocal about it? I dont vocalizing your personal distaste can push policy, and those you vote for, to enact changes that put action to your disagreement.

"I'm not an atheist, I consider myself agnostic. I want to believe in a higher power, but I'm not into blind faith. A higher power to me doesn't mean the god in abrahamic religions, or the many gods in all the other regions' religions, because I don't have any belief in any of them or their existance. There are nuances and differences. 

See our difference here is that I don't see the Ten Commandments as a goal, I see them as the bare minimum we should all strive towards. All 10 if you call yourself religious, which if we go by your comments you clearly are and not just a little, and most of the 10 if you aren't religious."

It's literally a core tenant of Marxism to do everything in your power to subvert the system in place to bring it down.‚Äù 

The point this individual is attempting to make is that the right cares about the systems in place and the left does not. I was simply pointing out the hypocrisy of a statement of this nature when conservatives - and even many members of conservative leadership who were lying through their teeth solely bc they thought it would help their reelection campaigns - attempted to undo the very foundation of the democratic process this nation depends on.

"Nancy Pelosi may be factually incorrect, but the American justice system has been broken for years, and honestly, I don't think she's wrong. The burden of proof no longer falls on the state. You are now presumed guilty until YOU prove your innocence. Once again, is she factually wrong? Absolutely. Unfortunately, the way most Americans are treated in court these days makes her correct."
"If this whole thing means we start prosecuting politicians for crimes, I would be so happy.

Maybe Trump helps us drain the swamp, after all."
What law is being invented???
"Election fraud isn't a political opinion though. Its a crime. Be thankful at least 1 of many politicians that commit crimes are being punished. It's pretty rare and I'd rather set the precedent for elected officials to be held accountable rather than ""I committed a crime but I'm the president so I can't be tried"" to be a thing. That seriously shouldn't be a thing"
Pretty much all high ranking politicians from both sides have skeletons in their closet and they know it.  That's why these types of political arrests are so uncommon.  The Democrats should be careful.  They don't want to open a Pandora's Box where conservative/Right wing politicians and DA's start going after them as well.
"All I can say is, if this is the new standard, they better apply it to the Democrats as well, many of whom I‚Äôm sure have done more questionable things than Trump."
But Orange Man bad!!!  He hurts my feels!!!
"Dems: get Trump at any cost

"no, it eliminates the old, democratic system of ordered liberty"
"I honestly don't think that the Dems are trying to destroy Trump. I think it even goes farther than that.

They brought this frivilous charge against Trump, specifically to rally his base around him. They WANT Rupublicans to rise up in disgust and 'rally the troops' to vote for Trump. They WANT Trump to win over these charges and win the Republican Primary. AND IT'S WORKING! Look at Trump's increased campaign revenue since the indictment.

They believe that if Trump wins the Republican primary, they have a shot at winning the next presidential race in 2024. They are very afraid if DeSantis or even if Pompeo wins the Republican ticket, for either of them will mop the floor with Biden.

If the Republicans win the presidency, we will control the White House, the House of Representatives, and the Senate! (Harris is not the tie-breaker).

This is all a trap......"
It will be (D)ifferent and we all know it. The law will only be applied to those who question/challenge the system as it is/will be.
"Interpreting a hush money payment to a person from before a campaign started as a campaign contribution is just nonsense.

Shall we count the number of positive articles from the New York times in favor of Biden as a campaign contribution and prosecute them for not reporting it as such.

Do you not see the ridiculous precedent being set?"
"Changing a misdemeanor, with a two year statute of limitations, to a felony, with no statute of limitations. Calling an unauthorized payment by a shister lawyer, who under oath swore he was never ask to pay, never authorized to pay, and was never reimbursed for the payment that was made before any announcement to run for office, a campaign contribution for hush money.  There, I listed two newly created laws."
Wouldn‚Äôt that be a good thing? DA‚Äôs should go after criminals no matter what party affiliation
"I think that would be a good thing, actually."
">	They don‚Äôt want to open a Pandora‚Äôs Box where conservative/Right wing politicians and DA‚Äôs start going after them as well.

One of the most common things Trump said in 2016 was ‚Äúlock her up.‚Äù I think that genie has already been let out of its bottle."
They are blinded by their fear of trump
The right-wing  Texas AG has been under federal indictment for years. He was re-elected during that.
"It‚Äôs not a lawsuit, it‚Äôs a criminal prosecution. ‚ÄúThe Dems‚Äù didn‚Äôt bring it, the people of the State of New York did based on probable cause for violations of New York law."
"Person in another sub mentioned something about this too. Talking about the 4 mil he‚Äôs raised since, it‚Äôs also draining the small dollar donations that another candidate might get."
">Comey

Who?"
Exactly
"I guess I‚Äôll have to see how the courts process this claim. I heard we don‚Äôt even know the charges yet, but maybe they‚Äôve been announced now and I just haven‚Äôt heard about it. The courts have to be carful, their rulings will set a precedent for future cases. If they get trump for something ridiculous then it will set in motion a series of events that will charge many other people in government for the same crime. If trump did something that other people don‚Äôt typically do, then the precedent won‚Äôt be significant. I guess we‚Äôll have to wait and see what happens."
"The charges weren‚Äôt released to the public yet, how do you know that‚Äôs what he is being charged for?"
Good for the public and society as a whole? Yes.  Good for the politicians? No. So most politicians don't want to open that can of worms.  That's why this thing with Trump could backfire for them.
"No. The implication here is that a partisan DA invented a crime to go after the leading opposition candidate to prevent him from running. 

It would not be a ""good thing"" if the new standard is to interfere in democracy via politicized lawfare that is not prohibited from inventing novel crime."
"It would work if we had honest DA‚Äôs that could be trusted to apply the law equally, fairly and a-politically.  Instead what we got was a bunch of Soros-backed sycophants that use ‚Äúprosecutorial discretion‚Äù as an excuse for applying a legal double-standard to political opponents. 

And it‚Äôs not just guys like Trump that are affected, but the entire community served by these DAs.  Hardened criminals are walking free in NYC because Bragg is too busy chasing after Trump instead of going after actual criminals."
Not sure why you're downvoted. TDS is real
"You're correct 'charge', not lawsuit. Corrected.

Also, the people of New York don't care. An over-zealeous DA and Grand Jury, who's being directed by the Dems, are charging him."
Based on all the information leaked to the legacy media.
"I don‚Äôt see this preventing him from running, if anything there will be a rally of support for him.

TDS wouldn‚Äôt disappear if he wasn‚Äôt running, I think these charges would have happened either way."
"Lol, Trump is not the leading opposition candidate. DeSantis is. Further, Trump running for president just ensures Biden gets another 4 years. 

For some reason, everyone but the blind Trump zealots see this. I guess that‚Äôs what you get for trusting a serial adulterer who has spent decades lying and refusing to pay his bills. When you have no moral foundation, you‚Äôll fall for anyone. 

DeSantis is the only chance the Right has of beating Biden and it only works if Trump doesn‚Äôt run. Past time to figure that out."
"Don't believe it's Novel. Listened to legal analysis by an actual lawyer. 

The thing is Trump has committed A LOT of crimes but they are going to pursue the ones they think they can nail him on. DAs tend to only prosecute crimes when they think the charges will stick. This is why petty theft tends to go uncharged and instead they wait until a person has committed a felony amount of theft."
Butthurt democrat loser lurkers downvote everything
"To be clear, the Grand Jury charged him after completing their investigation. The DA provided evidence.

We don‚Äôt know much about the makeup of the Grand Jury but one thing is for sure, they are very much citizens of New York and likely hold a variety of political positions.

The grand jury system and the Grand Jury in particular have both been praised by Trump in recent days."
Link to the listed charges please?
"TDS would disappear if he wan't running, for all intents and purposes. 

TDS if fueled by Trump's status as President and his potential to regain it. To wit, see the fact that the severe MSM and Left Wing vitriol against George Bush lessened to the degree, post presidency, that he was politically rehabilitated. Almost totally. Today, the Left largely has no issue with images of GWB and Obama frolicking. GWB was a man that the Left commonly and without irony compared to Hitler.

No one thinks that these charges would have happened either way, and no one has the credibility to assert as much given the timing.

Uniparty leaders have been leveraging the indictment to call for Trump to drop out of the race."
"Good point. It's also hard to fully understand until the charges are unsealed. However, I still smell a grand scheme in all of this. So do a few political analysts."
"Have you not kept up with all the news reports?  Pick the news site you think is most true, search for Trump charges, you will see everything they cliam they know or was leaked to them (if a liberal site).

"Tbf bush should be tried for his role in the approval and implementation of ""enhanced interrogation,"" which was basically state approved torture."
"Too many people here don't realize that the media attacks on Trump aren't really focused on him personally.  The Democrat Propaganda Machine (aka media) has been targeting the biggest opponent to their power.  That's been Trump ever since 2015.  Before 2015, the media and the left LOVED Trump.  That immediately changed when he announced he was running as a Republican.  
Everyone around here who believes that Trump ""just has too much baggage"" or ""is too toxic"" doesn't really get what happened.  The media brainwashed the emotionally manipulated to hate Trump, completely separate from any actual justification.  The media manufactured all the outrage and hate.  They will do it again to the next Republican candidate, and yes, it will be just as bad.  Thinking that any other Republican won't have the same thing happen to him is just na√Øve."
"Everything in all of these articles are just speculation, and there isn‚Äôt any new news in these articles that hasn‚Äôt already been covered in the news. There‚Äôs lots of talk about an illegal payment trump made in reference to his affair with stormy daniels, but as I suspected, no charges have been announced yet. Until those charges come out, no one can attack or defend him, as we don‚Äôt know the specific charges, just professional speculation at this point. We can‚Äôt jump the gun and defend or attack the validity of a charge if we don‚Äôt know the charges yet. At best we can guess what he will be charged with and then we could defend or attack that charge, but what‚Äôs the point, let‚Äôs just wait until the charges are announced.

People on the left are screaming ‚Äúfinally‚Äù but they don‚Äôt know shit about what he‚Äôs being charged with. Same with the right, defending him against charges we don‚Äôt even know what they are yet. I understand it‚Äôs crazy news, but that‚Äôs no reason to respond in like, just be patient, the charges will be announced soon enough, and then people can dissect the law on those specific charges."

"I asked ChatGPT ""Should humans sacrifice themselves to save the planet?""

>As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or beliefs, but I can provide information and perspectives on the topic.  
>  
>The question of whether humans should sacrifice themselves to save the planet is a complex ethical and philosophical issue. On one hand, many people argue that humans have a moral obligation to protect the planet and all its inhabitants, including other species and future generations. ***From this perspective, sacrificing oneself to save the planet could be seen as a heroic act of selflessness and environmental stewardship.***  
>  
>On the other hand, some may argue that it is not necessary for individuals to make such a drastic sacrifice, as there are many other ways to address environmental issues that do not involve personal harm or death. For example, people can work to reduce their carbon footprint, support environmentally-friendly policies and technologies, and advocate for conservation efforts.  
>  
>Ultimately, the decision to sacrifice oneself to save the planet is a personal one that depends on an individual's values, beliefs, and circumstances. It is important to remember that environmental issues require collective action, and that even small steps can make a difference in protecting the planet."

"They're not programmed in the classic sense. AI are programmed via machine learning. They're fed an enormous amount of data from various sources, and complex math produces the facsimile of intelligence by analyzing the patterns found in that data. 

ChatGPT was created from a lot of data from internet sources: websites, articles, Wikipedia, books, etc. Probably a *lot* more sources as well, that's just some things listed on OpenAI's website. The AI is basically just a conglomeration of what other people have said. For that reason, it has (probably) unintentional biases. Its creators ain't gonna vet *millions* of websites, books, etc. to make sure they all balance out politically so the AI isnt biased.

I definitely can see a world where the people with 1 or 2 visits did nothing wrong. New marks need to be eased into depravity.

In the same way, I can definitely see Epstein bringing girls to mar-a-lago. Something crossed a line there at some point though.

I can guess new marks were provided with acceptably aged people at first. Epstein‚Äôs a trustworthy friend to many, he wouldn‚Äôt do anything that could get me in trouble kinda thing. Alternatively, break them by using someone underaged from the start and having blackmail but that‚Äôs not the possibility being discussed here.

At some point there‚Äôs an obvious line crossed where someone is unarguably underaged/unwilling.
So, at what point did someone unwittingly be led into committing a crime and at what point did it become willingly.

I seriously don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs nothing to be seen even for first time visitors. I also really don‚Äôt get why Trump would be the best candidate to take to trial first. There‚Äôs too much of a difference between how he was handled and the rest of the island‚Äôs regulars. He should 100% be investigated though. I just wouldn‚Äôt put the guy not in the blackbook on trial first‚Ä¶"
"Epstein was probably renting his plane when he wasn't using it. The flight records indicate Trump never visited the island, he probably just rented the plane once or twice."
If the 34 separate count information is correct I‚Äôm curious as to what additional crimes they‚Äôve charged him with and whether or not they are even related to the Stormy Daniels stuff. At most I‚Äôd say half would be Stormy related.
Hopefully you are talking about leftists. The bizarre indoctrination going on in schools is outrageous and unbelievable to me. The fact that some of these so-called teachers are allowed near young children is astonishing.

Trump banned Epstein from his properties due to harassing young female guests.

"We‚Äôll find out on Tuesday. They have to be related to Daniels & Cohen. Cohen had a 7 count  superseding indictment - Rat . Costello was a good wit I‚Äôm hearing. It‚Äôs a huge indictment and Meg Reiss needs to recuse herself or I am filing a Bar complaint. The New York County grand jury & jury pool is scary. Kangaroo court. If Trump beats this , he will face someone I have firsthand experience with , Fulton County Judge Robert McBurney , who is anti gun , anti patriot , Liberal , foaming at the mouth for that indictment. Let‚Äôs see the defense. Trump can still run for President from jail and he‚Äôs crushing the numbers. #FreeTexMcIver #McWordy
Let‚Äôs keep in mind the DOJ said this case was weak and had no merits and refused to even bring it in front of a GJ!"
Correct.
"Also didn‚Äôt he help with Epstein‚Äôs first trial?

There‚Äôs definitely evidence that Trump was at the very least either put off by his actions or shocked by something.

It‚Äôs also entirely possible at the same time Epstein brought girls to Trump and went way too far or brought something ‚Äúspecial‚Äù or did something that he wasn‚Äôt okay with at all. I. E. Trump was involved but there was a limit. Which could have simply been <18  or <16 or worse. Again it might have seemed like Epstein was an ordinary pimp for the rich and famous.

That he made a decisive action to ban him says something. What that something is I don‚Äôt know. I definitely think Epstein brought girls to him though. The question is were they underage and was that with Trump‚Äôs knowledge. I can definitely see a world where people trusted the pimp for the rich and famous because who would think that someone trusted by others is going to compromise everyone.

I can definitely see someone‚Äôs first trip to the island being a shock too. The repeaters‚Ä¶ I really doubt there‚Äôs anything one could defend them with. The only argument I could think of was the first visit was normal and subsequent ones were more messed up.

Still - why was the closest thing to damming him Trump then? I honestly don‚Äôt think it was a case of nothing happened at the island with most of them‚Ä¶"
Yeah but... ORANGE MAN BAD!!!!1!1!
Hillary is almost a mitigating circumstance.
Probably but what does that have to do with the nonsense you said about Epstein?
"My son just graduated with a BS in Mathematics. His dream job, which he accepted, is to teach AP Mathematics to kids. He‚Äôs just starting out. I worry about the insanity that permeates within the public school system. I am a product of public school during the 50s to 70. Things have changed so much. Times have changed so much. God help us."
"Epstein was recording videos of all those powerful people with underage girls. The man was working for a state intelligence agency, most likely Israel or the USA. The Robert/Ghislaine Maxwell connection makes me lean toward Israel. Judging from the list of models, actresses, and athletes Trump dated the man needed no assistance finding women."
Yes that was the only reason we didn‚Äôt like himüòé
"Well it wasn‚Äôt nonsense because it‚Äôs a well known fact that Trump was on Epstein‚Äôs flight logs numerous times and was great friends with him, so it wouldn‚Äôt be that much of a stretch to assume trump would be an Epstein associate, and it‚Äôs just another reason Desantis I‚Äôd the better option"

Is that not the governor who was taking money from a cartel?
Man she's not the governor c'mon man.

"When I was stationed in West Germany in the late 70's there was a park in Frankfurt we called ""Shit Park.""  You could deal, but, drigs and sleep in the park.  Amsterdam was the same.  The Germans said the US went from prehistory to decadence without passing through civilization.  Guess the homeless camps and open air drug markets are what yhey meant by civilization.  Of course the ""crazy sex we s"" in Frankfurt, the ""wall"" in Nuremburg, and yhe red light district in Amsterdam could have been civilized too"
Would this have gotten around the Ninth Circuit ruling out of Idaho that made it illegal for public officials to prevent homeless people from sleeping on public property unless they could prove they had adequate beds available? Or would it have just been tied up in court and then reversed?
Where would you have them camp? Since we aren‚Äôt helping them?
"Assuming a homeless shelter has no room, where else are they supposed to sleep? Are the homeless just expected to clap their hands and vanish into thin air?"
Lol not the Governor. Refuse to believe Arizona elected this clown.
How do we do this in CO
I think the homeless should be provided maps!!!
"Maybe there should be better funded programs to help them get jobs and address their mental disorders? 

Forcing them to go somewhere else isn't really helping public safety. It is just kinda moving the problem somewhere else isn't it? It's also worth pointing out that they too are the public."
"you can thank people who fled CA, they brought their left leaning views into AZ. Once AZ becomes the new CA, they will leave do it all over again in the other red state. They are locusts, consuming all resources then go to to next area."

"In a homeless shelter.  But then they would have to not use drugs, please themselves in public, not assault others and generally live by rules."
In front of your house
"The issue then becomes "" you can't help someone who doesn't want to help themself"". Even if these programs were funded to the amounts they need, you can't force someone to get help. Some would take the help buy I feel most wouldn't. The big issue I think we need to tackle is removing the stigma of ""mental health"" and stop treating it like some dirty word."
"Well, in Austin around the same time they did try something, they purchased a hotel and we're going to renovate it to help people get back on their feet and provide resources, including mental health I believe.

https://www.foxnews.com/us/austin-hotel-purchased-homeless-shelter-vandalized-nearly-every-door-bashed-damage

[Unfortunately people absolutely destroyed it,](https://www.foxnews.com/us/austin-hotel-purchased-homeless-shelter-vandalized-nearly-every-door-bashed-damage) and caused so much damage, [And another country decided to sue them, ](https://www.kvue.com/article/news/local/homeless/candlewood-suites-homeless-austin-contract-family-eldercare/269-b9942434-1d18-4561-9a0f-d1dbaac75700) pretty much going with the not in my backyard ordeal. Not really going for any argument, just giving more sad news :("
"Have you met a lot of homeless people? I take it not. Most of them don't want any help. They like their life as is. I should know, I was homeless for almost a year, and the ONLY thing keeping me and everyone around me homeless was our own choices. There were a few differences. Some had major mental health issues, but even they wouldnt accept any sort of help, apart from free food/money. 

When I decided that that life was an absolute waste of everything I had, I changed my life around. Got off drugs, got a job and did whatever I could to not go back there. 

It's not as simple as ""hurr durr throw more tax money at them"". There are deep seated psychological issues at play. There should definitely be resources out there, and for the most part there already is. Until the individual decides they want a different life, nothing, absolutely nothing will change their attitude towards life."
">Maybe there should be better funded programs to help them get jobs and address their mental disorders? 

Absolutely, and it would help some and improve things.

>Forcing them to go somewhere else isn't really helping public safety

Well, some of them are quite violent, so yes, so while camping bans treat the symptom and not the disease it's a dangerous enough symptom that it needs to be remedied immediately.  Sort of like using motrin or Tylenol to bring down a deadly fever. Doesn't cure what you've got, but saves you from a serious affect of it."
That's my personal struggle with being a conservative. So many policies will be put in place that do so much harm to people that it makes me second guess myself sometimes.
"Exactly. These Californians move to an area and they swear up and down that they aren't one of ""Those"" Californians but then they almost immediately turn around and start complaining because there's ""Too many guns"" or because everybody goes to Church on Sunday, Et Cetera. I laugh whenever I see people complain because they got sideways looks when moving to a new area because they have California plates."
"You‚Äôre missing the forest for the trees. California was at the same demographic precipice in the 1980‚Äôs when Reagan granted amnesty to millions of illegal aliens. This created a democratic super majority in a previously purple California and the state has never recovered.

This is the exact same situation we are seeing in Arizona as millions of democrat voting Hispanics are demographically altering the region into a majority minority state. If this trend continues the outcome is inevitable unless Hispanics suddenly shift their political disposition and became a majority red demographic (which everyone said would occur in 2022, but it didn‚Äôt happen). Centrist republicans aren‚Äôt ready to grapple with this fact, but they need to in order to solve this problem. Blaming liberal Californians for the political shift is futile, and does nothing to address the real issue."
"no, every single Californian that i now that moved to AZ is more conservative than most people i grew up with in Phoenix. if you want to place blame anywhere, blame the AZ GOP for alienating centrists and libertarians."
"In this case, we can thank Trump and Kari Lake lmfao. They‚Äôre the reason Katie Hobbs had to do literally nothing to win the governorship."
"Yep that‚Äôs something a lot of people don‚Äôt consider. Living in AZ, I‚Äôve had multiple friends who want to leave, yet they don‚Äôt understand they are just buying themselves a little bit of time. That Blue cancer is spreading everywhere."
"Unfortunate, because Arizona is one of the most beautiful states in America."
Arizona had a unified Republican government and didn't change their election laws after the 2020 shit show. The people of Arizona did this to themselves.
"What if there's no room, or they've stayed too long and get kicked out? Making it illegal just means they'll get arrested and we'll end up paying for their food and housing anyway."
"Ahhhhh, hopium."
"""Housing is a human right, except they cannot come into my house. I don't want a crazy drug addicted homeless person on my couch, I want the government to seize your income and use it to put them in apartments next door to your property."""
"This, 1000 times over‚Ä¶.I strongly encourage everyone to work a soup kitchen or shelter and actually talk to homeless‚Ä¶.most are that way by choice or are drug addicted and don‚Äôt want to improve their situation."
"Yeah that is sad news. I'm not sure of the finer details of that program, but I'd like to think that homelessness simply isn't a lost cause. I wonder if a program like that could have been handled differently and worked out better."
"Don't you feel like a willingness to live on the street is an indication of some underlying issue? They don't have to be major mental health issues, there are minor ones that would cause that. 

Even your personal example points to drug use. 

But I'll concede I haven't lived with homeless people nor have I myself been homeless. Just saying that if homeless people are a threat to public safety, pushing them out of an area only spreads the issue outward and doesn't provide any overall improvement. Yeah, Main Street maybe doesn't have 10 incidents in a month but the county itself likely has the same number of incidents it always had. 

I don't claim to have the perfect solution. I offered some off-the-cuff suggestions but maybe someone like yourself could offer more useful suggestions."
"That's fair, but they aren't proposing sweeping initiatives to take care of the overall issue. Also I pointed out that it only shifts the problem. The homeless people don't magically cease to exist because they can't camp on the streets. So really it only shifts the incidents away from concentrated areas. 

If it does help it only does so because these homeless people eventually get arrested for breaking the law and then live off the state. So at the point we're just wasting money.

So using your metaphor: It's really more like using a cold compress to treat a fever from a severe infection."
"Yeah I mean part of the reason I disagree with it is because it will just throw more homeless people in jail. We will all still be paying for the homeless problem, but I'd rather that money go towards helping them become members of society rather than providing them food and housing in a prison cell."
"The CA transplants always think they‚Äôre voting for a ‚Äòmoderate‚Äô Dem, not realizing that the new Democrat party has no semblance of moderation.  Hobbs refused to debate e, gave few interviews and still won.  No one knew much about her.  It‚Äôs depressing."
The guy clearly said there was room at Gospel Rescue Mission.
"Yea it almost always has an underlying issue. 90% are drugs. Drugs, despite what we tell ourselves, are voluntary. It's tough, but 100% doable to get off drugs. But they are fun, and offer a lot to the people who use them. So much so they give up everything in their life to continue using them, including living in a building. 

And unfortunately, from what I seen, the only way to change the situation is to somehow initiate life changing epiphanies on an individual basis to every drug addict in the USA. Not really practical. Short of that, enforcing the laws on the books, valuing public safety over criminal emotional sentiments, and having a zero tolerance type policy on violence are good stepping stones. 

Trust me dude, it's bad. And those in the midst enjoy it."
"I don't disagree with anything you've said.  To continue the metaphor theTylenol is all we have at the moment, and you're right, we need to work on an actual working treatment for disease.  Sadly I'm sure you'll agree that will take time."
"You remember that old saying ""can lead a horse to water, but can't make him drink""? 

It's been around for a long long time for a very good reason. Empathy is a wonderful thing. However empathy sans any practicality or objective analysis of the whole situation does more harm than good."
"I reallydon't believe in them wanting to vote in a ""Moderate"" really, I believe that they have the mindset of believing that Republicans/Conservatives are literally ""nAziS!1!"" from watching too much Leftist media, So they have the ""Vote Blue No Matter Who!"" outlook. 

And quite frankly a lot of them don't realize WHY Democrats are bad, A substantial amount of transplants say they left California due to the drugs, The high-cost of living, The homeless, Et Cetera. But they don't understand that those reasons are caused BY the Democrats."
"Again, as someone who has never been a drug user, I'll appeal to your expertise. Are you saying that the general portrayal of drugs being highly addictive and causing social and financial hardship is overblown? That at the point where they are homeless, at any point, they could easily put the drugs down and fix all their problems by their own willpower?

I'm not trying to sound snide and I realize I might come off that way, but on one hand you're saying these people simply need to want it while on the other hand that they are addicted to substances that are known to ruin lives."
"I replied above with more information regarding the Austin situation, and yeah, I don't got an answer either. Hell, I remember first visiting here in 2019, and the homeless population had a camp below i-35 and 6th street roughly, just lining the highway. That encampment area was removed, and all that happened was the homeless moved more south and southwest towards the Southpark Meadows area and Menchaca area. Gave the area names in case you want to look up x)

And it's hard. Lots don't want help as you said, and I rmember one guy I met l, he was given an uber ride from the south area towards a small hostel/motel in downtown. Had a lot of shit luck, was trying to turn his life around, hadn't had a shower recently, and he kept apologizing for his looks and smell and you could just hear it in his voice that he was trying  to do what he could, but life, and addictions, are batshit insanely difficult at times, especially without a support net. It's. Life is hard."
"Yeah, I agree that it will take time, but homelessness isn't a NEW problem. So in my mind, these laws are at best trying to subvert the issue and history tells me this is where the buck stops. Because they almost never result in dramatic efforts to correct the overall issue and make meaningful change. 

Maybe I'm just cynical."
"They are voting moderate.  According to them.

What you don‚Äôt understand is that they think people like AOC and Ilhan Omar are moderate centerists.

They are the moderates, the just, the benevolent, the pure.  Anyone who doesn‚Äôt think or vote like them is evil."
Truth
"I'm saying our whole attitude towards drugs as a whole is under-blown. We don't take them serious enough as a culture and it is ruining lives. 

But the main point I'm getting to is throwing tax dollars at it does nothing. There obviously needs to be treatment centers and access to care. But there already is.

Funny, but what really did it for me was jail. As well as many others.  Maybe if ide been caught or sentenced earlier in my life I wouldn't have suffered so needlessly. Again the current trend of catch and release that is ramrodding our justice system is only increasing the issues we are seeing with drugs and homelessness"

"My son and most of his classmates were sick late 2019, it was different as most were bed ridden for days, I am convinced it was COVID, he has not been sick since (knock on wood)"
"I was sick in late 2019-most noticably a cough that lasted forever. I have sporadic asthma, but my PCP had no clue what was causing my cough.
It's now thought that I had a very early case of teh covidz."
"I got really sick in late 2019 and I stayed sick from late November to near Christmas. I kept telling friends, family, and co workers it felt like a really bad flu but a flu I couldn't shake and it was the first ""flu"" I ever had with severe muscle aches."
"My wife and I are both in healthcare and we were both sick late November/early December. Neither of us got the vax until several months after its development when it was basically forced on hospital workers, but neither of us ever got COVID during the 9‚Äì12-month height of the 'pandemic'.

My wife later did come down positive again (post vax and booster) after the Omicron variant, but we did nothing for me at home keeping distance (other than standard precautions of not eating or drinking after, etc.), and I have never experienced a COVID positive test since end of 2019. I was in direct contact with multiple COVID positive hospitalized patients nearly every single day of the pandemic.

The best immunity is gained post recovery of the virus you want immunity from."

"My whole household was terribly ill the entire month of Feb 2020. The cough hurt so bad I thought I was going to have to go to the hospital. My doctor put me on antibiotics for 20 days, my husband was given an inhaler & told he had walking pneumonia.  The kids got antibiotics. 

I am convinced that we had covid."

"Biden drained the strategic oil reserve by half in just one year interfering with the 2022 elections. 

No surprise- now OPEC+ is going to try and force him to drain the other half.

more.

At this point it's pretty clear Biden has isolated us on the world stage.  It seems like nations that are  allying with China is escalating.
Bought and paid for
Again something they said Trump would do
"Well yeah, they can't hold out forever. It was always clear the world would cave to China before Russia would cave to the world."
He has no chance in hell of becoming president. Nobody likes him.
I think Manchin could do the most good by running as a third party candidate.
"If the agenda is so bad, why TF did he vote for it?"
"The biggest problem I see for Manchin if he wants to run - besides  having managed to piss off people on both sides of the  aisle - is that he has shown himself to be maybe gullible or able to be swayed like he was when he voted for Biden's Inflation Reduction Act.  Of course  Biden betrayed  Manchin and backed out of their deal because Biden is a lying piece of crap weasel but still, Manchin fell for it.  He should have known  Biden would betray him but he seemingly didn't."
I‚Äôd love a conservative democrat on that ticket.
I would rather him than Biden because at least if a conservative doesn‚Äôt win we don‚Äôt spiral from the quickest recovery in history to inflation and recession with in 2 years
"Manchin is the last Liberal in the Democrat party, the rest are Marxists and Socialists."
He spoke his mind. We need more of that in Washington.
"He's a self-aggrandizing pompous d-bag. He pretends to be moderate once in a while, then toes the party line 90% of the time"
I think he has a decent shot if Desantis doesn't run
I kinda like him but I wouldn't vote for him.
That's what really boggles the mind.
"I don't think Manchin comprehends just how extreme his party has become, especially in the House."
"He really messed up by trusting Biden, he had such a great position and he messed it all up, to the point no one likes him on either side and he is probably going to get steamrolled in 2024 if he runs for reelection."
He‚Äôs a classic liberal. I don‚Äôt mind those. Fiscally liberal socially conservative. I think.
I think you're right about that.
I think you're exactly right.  I almost feel bad for him because it seems he believed he was doing the right thing for his state but it bit him in the end on many levels.  He should have known not to trust  Biden but I guess if he didn't know not to trust him and that his party is filled with back stabbing-vipers then maybe he shouldn't be in DC anyway.
"I disagree with that assessment. I don't think he has the principles to be called classically liberal (which i consider myself). He's embraced or at least ignored the wokeism and equity push, which is decidedly anti-small government"
I think he felt like it was a perfect opportunity to show some kind of compromise and show that he played it down the middle. Problem is Biden's handlers have hated Blue Dog Democrats since the Obamacare negotiation fiasco which led to Democrats leaving the Blue Dogs out to dry during the midterms. I honestly don't think Manchin realized how insane Biden's handlers and the modern Democrat Party truly are and didn't think they would screw him over.

He‚Äôs terrific.
"The more flooded the field gets, the better chance we have at a candidate winning with well under 50% support (again).

I have heard Vivek in interviews and I think he has great ideas. I like him. But the reality is he has next-to no name recognition and is just not a viable candidate. If he stays in the race during the primaries, he is only getting in the way."

"I think the problem is he will take votes from DeSantis in the primary, meaning if he gets big enough that Trump will easily win....which right now I'm not sure is the worst thing.  I want DeSantis or Vivek over Trump, but I'm not sure either would do better than Trump in the general election against the Dems.  Trump voters might not show up for DeSantis or Vivek, but I think most republicans would go out and vote Trump over any D candidate."
Your point being every republicans nominee will create a left wing shot show.

"I disagree with the notion that a more sensible, down-to-Earth candidate would do worse nationally. And we really can't do worse than we did in 2020 since 2020 was a loss."
More to the point the left will create a shitshow proportionate to the popularity of a Republican candidate no matter who.
"No. I take issue with your phrasing that any Republican nominee ""creates"" anything that the Left chooses to do. The Left is solely responsible for what they do. 

My point is that whether or not GOP candidates inspire Left Wing plots and insanity, the GOP cannot be bullied or otherwise influenced over who it nominates in order to placate Leftist temper tantrums. Doing so only gives the temper tantrums antidemocratic power."

"Rule of Law is the simple principle that no one is above the law. That includes Supreme Court Justices. The problem is the left has slowly but surely shifted into nihilism, and the elites do feel they are above the law. That the laws are for the ""little people""."

">republican party paid Steel to investigate Trump 

Absolutely wrong. The Republican party paid Glenn Simpson to look for dirt on Trump. Glenn Simpson hired Steele months after Clinton picked up the contract. [source](https://archive.ph/qlmsB)."
"Which is why it is nonsense when anyone points to bipartisan support for assisting an anti conservative agenda since the Trump years. 

The Uniparty is not partisan nor bipartisan. Which is a bad thing for democracy."
The initial dossier looked nothing like what it morphed into when Clinton took it over.  Prior to that it was very benign and without all the salacious garbage.
"This comment is misleading.  The problem wasn‚Äôt that she paid for the dossier, but that she miss reported the payments as legal fees.  The difference is that it was obviously campaign related for her, but not for Trump.  Also, the fact that she was fined and not indicted on criminal charges."
"Its absolutely a ""good move"". A bad move is allowing the opposition's and the State's actions to win in determining who can be a leading candidate and who can't."
The initial dossier didn't even involve Steele. He was added after Fusion GPS started working for Clinton.
"It went from ""see if he did anything illegal, we don't want him."" To ""make it sound like he's an asset of the soviet union."""

"For context for non-Canadians, when the carbon tax was introduced, people rightfully called out that it would increase the cost of living.

Our government claimed that people would get rebates after filing taxes and the rebates would on average equal more than what they paid in carbon taxes, thus only financially punishing businesses who pollute.

This was BS, as what they sited for how they determined how much people should receive didn‚Äôt in fact take into account all aspects of what the carbon tax would hit.  Which was basically everything.

The government watch dog office that is appointed by the Prime Minister (in this case Trudeau) came out with a report that stated actually over 60% of Canadians would not benefit from the rebate because they ‚Äúmake too much‚Äù, the amount of rebate is based on your income, with the lowest income earners getting the most.

Now with inflation (that they caused) ontop of a crumbling economy (that they caused), the latest increase to our carbon tax now puts majority of the Canadians now paying more than even the rebate can supposedly offset.  So far it‚Äôs at best 20% of Canadians see any benefit from the rebate.

This from our PM who had a private jet fly from one city to another so he didn‚Äôt have to drive an hour in traffic to catch said private jet.  Cause living by example is for the poor.

Edit: Missed some info that was needed."
This peice of shit is a full on eco terrorists
Thank you for the breakdown. Much appreciated.
"The amount received is not based on your income. You can find this on Canada's official government website or by reading the instructions while filing your taxes this year.

The amount taxed at the pump is about a 7-9% increase. The amount rebated annually pays for ~35%(minor variations per province) of the average Canadians fuel usage per year at ~3l/ per capita per day.(including all gasoline used for the entire country of Canada including both buisness and personal use.)

Any other metrics addressed would need to be proven as directly tied to the carbon tax with few significant external factors to be even remotely arguable in context, which they are not.

I do hope he becomes the nominee. This is coming from an avid Trump supporter. I just have more faith he‚Äôll win a general election.
Bragg is simply following his master's agenda. Soros has him (and many others) mind controlled.
I agree but I‚Äôd also be ok if they ran on a ticket together - Trump as President and DeSantis as VP. Trump would get all the MAGA people and DeSantis would get the moderates. The momentum from fixing Biden‚Äôs economic maelstrom would then translate cleanly into a 2028 Presidential run for desantis
"DeSantis has no chance at becoming the nominee, especially now. He shouldn't even declare to avoid getting scuffed up in 2024. But if he does, that;s fine too. It's his career.

Trump has a better chance than DeSantis at winning the General. For all of the bitter Never Trumpers with TDS who threaten to not vote for Trump if DeSantis doesn't get the nomination, all the while claiming that MAGA is dividing the party, there are multitudes more Trump voters who now feel the same way.

This indictment is nothing but a win at the polls for Trump, in what was already going to be a very close general election."
"The entire Biden coalition was built on anti-Trump sentiment. As in if Trump goes away, Democrats just fall apart in 2024."
Nah
You‚Äôre literally just assuming lol. Desantis has a good chance of beating trump and a better chance of beating biden

Agreed.  Very trashy.
We should be better but this sub seems to love posting biased trash articles all the while complaining about the MSM and their biased reporting. Real shame as it does us no good putting ourselves in our own information bubble.

Basically if I was on the jury I‚Äôd vote not guilty. It may not exactly follow the law but the laws do nothing for victims."
That'll learn him.

"When a group of engineering students I worked with developed a hypothetical tracking device that used cellphone towers 2 decades ago, we specifically blocked the end user from being able to access the location of their stolen property.

A mostly peaceful disagreement over ownership and unauthorized acquiesce of a motor vehicle.
Only an asshole gets killed over a car
I think the difference between the two is that grand theft auto (in my former state) requires proof or evidence that they intended to keep it. While taking it for a joyride would be unauthorized use. It could also be the prosecutor made a deal for a lesser charge.
The first good news in a while
Best advice right here!
Are you surprised? Most of Reddit is full of Leftists except for a few safe-havens such as this Subreddit.
"Yeah I read some of those comments lol. Seems like some people have the privilege of living in a safe area or never owning something of high value that they genuinely worked hard to get.

Yeah it‚Äôs just a truck to other people but it‚Äôs most likely their way to work, insurance might cover it if you have full coverage and if it does you still probably have to pay a deductible and your rates will raise.

If someone is willing to steal someone‚Äôs vehicle they‚Äôll probably do it again or do other criminal acts. Also stealing someone vehicle in Texas of all states is the dumbest thing you could do other than breaking into someone‚Äôs house. If the police managed to catch them it would have to go to court and they‚Äôd be out in a year or less and they‚Äôll more than likely do the same thing. 

If your life gives no value to society why should society value your life at all."
"He‚Äôs the wind that blows the trash down the street, and in the process sweeps the gutter clean."
"You see, it was the thief that valued the truck more than his own life; I'm just defending my own life and property. If they choose the path that potentially leads to death, that's on them."
"If the person is a criminal and thief, then yes. A truck at least has some use and value."
But the thief would get a stern talking to
"If I'm in a truck I stole, have a gun, and I hear someone approaching me saying ""hey that's my truck""....in Texas...if I don't immediately throw my hands in the air yelling sorry...i have signed up for a spot at the local morgue."
Yikes. There‚Äôs always at least one boot licker.

"The police are proving that they do not act in cases like these. Society has seemed to have forgotten that a big reason to have police is so that people don't have to resort to vigilante justice.  In the absence of police who provide a satisfactory response, vigilantes are inevitable."

I‚Äôm going with evil. My final answer.
Both.
Yes
Rule of thumb should be not to ascribe anything' to evil which can be also blamed on stupidity.  Lots and lots of stupidity.
Have no doubt... they are Pure Evil! They no longer even try to hide it.
Collectively they are the dumbest group of humans on the planet. You only need to look at New York and California for the scientific data.
Evil. 100%.
Fact checked: TRUE
"Glad to see this as the top comment, came here just for that."
Never attribute to malice that which can be explained by stupidity.
I think a lot of their voters are evil too. They want to be fed and taken care of in addition to having their way no matter how unreasonable it is.
"Um, I dunno.  trump put his kids in charge of the middle east, and stole top secret documents.  Lindsey Graham, Ted Cruz and Lauren Boebert are just weasels.  And you cannot run candidates like Herschel Walker or Dr. F\*ing Oz and expect people to vote R. The overturn of Roe v Wade may fit your religious agenda, but it wasn't popular.  Banning books.  Getting all worked up about someone's sexual orientation.  At least implying that you would throw Ukraine to the wolves and perhaps abandon NATO. Massive government debt accrued under Republican leadership.  The list goes on.

I'm an actual conservative.  And I have no love for Nancy Pelosi; but trumpism has made it damn hard to vote R in many cases.  Look at a candidate like Hickenlooper from Colorado.  A pro business guy who is sane, and he is a Dem.  And if the Dems keep the senate it checks the massive problems associated w/ trump getting a second term (if it had happened).  Hick is an easy pick.

The Republicans need sane candidates.  trump, Walker, Oz et al don't fit that bill.  So they lose.  And similar candidates will lose next time.  People vote party, until the clown show shows up."
I didn't say our side was composed of Angels.  Ted Cruz is an alright guy.  I've met him and he seems pretty genuine.  MTG and Boebhert are kinda wacky though.  But all in all....I'd trust them more than Kamala or Biden.  At least I can trust them to mostly try to make a buck while keeping America more or less normal.  The Dems wanna make a buck selling off our countries corpse.
Among republicans or is trump reclaiming independents?
It‚Äôs a good thing primaries are still almost a year away.
DeSantis hasn‚Äôt officially announced yet I think.
This was the plan all along. Democrats want to face Trump.
"Love how desperate some outlets are to push Trump.

Yes, this is the rally round the Trump effect that happens every time he gets wrongly attacked.

No it doesn't mean the primaries are a given because (1) they're months out and (2) Trump has yet to prove disciplined enough to not make this solely about him which is where he loses significant ground."
So that means he‚Äôs going to beat trump and biden and be the next president
"Well, he‚Äôs not a candidate, so I doubt he cares."
"Of course he's not. MAGA have lost them every election since 2016, including last year after the Mar-a-lago raid and with record inflation, gas prices etc"
With the way the news cycle goes that‚Äôs practically an eternity.
"He might not run in 2024.  If he doesn‚Äôt run then he is the automatic front runner for 2028.  If he does run and loses to Trump, well, look where Jeb is today‚Ä¶"
"He hasn‚Äôt. And when he does and the media shits all over him for breathing funny, he might instantly lead Trump in these."
I‚Äôve been screaming this from the rooftops since he announced he thought he was going to be indicted. It is so plainly obvious that this is being done to help him win the primaries because everyone including democrats) knew this would happen. For some reason his loyalists just can‚Äôt see it as they all lineup to defend him harder than they ever have.
Nice flair lol
No he isn‚Äôt. By 2028 he will have been out of politics for 2 years and an afterthought just like Jeb was in 2016. Jeb waited to long to run.
"If he doesn't run then it's over for him. You don't get momentum like this whenever you want it, and you don't 'wait your turn'. By 2028 he'll be out of office doing nothing for 2 years, the Electoral College map could be beyond Republicans and after Trump loses again, what's to say he won't run again in 2028? 

If not him then what about a Kari lake? DeSantis would have the same issues going against her, where of course she'd go on to be absolutely crippled in the general but the base don't think like that."
"> he is the automatic front runner for 2028.

After being out of office for a year and out of the spotlight?  Remember, he's not Trump, he won't get free nonstop media coverage every day.  He'll be memory holed."
That‚Äôs because his loyalists don‚Äôt care about winning or advancing conservatism.
Thanks üòé
"Jeb was out of office for like 10 years, not 2.  A better analogy would be Clinton or Biden.  A short time out of office (would be less than 1 year by the time he would announce)."
"Not holding office for 2 years before running for president?  Sounds like Hillary, Biden, and Jeb Bush.  They were all out of government for years before running for president.  

DeSantis could strike a deal for the Trump endorsement in 2028 by not running in 2024.  That would clear the path for him in 2028.  It‚Äôs his choice though so we will see‚Ä¶"
"Trump ran and won by force of will, when he wanted to. Your model isn't valid. It is more like an excuse for milquetoast candidates when they lose, which allows them to evade confronting the truth of the matter.

If DeSantis is viable, then he can create his own momentum in 2028. That might actually prove that he is more than beltway anti-Trump hype. And that he actually has the political backbone and creativity to lead, rather than merely riding Trump's coat-tails.

DeSantis is about to be severely starved of attention, due to the indictment. For better or worse, he doesn't have a chance in 2024. I'd advise him to avoid your terrible advice and to wait until 2028.

But unlike DeSantis supporters in regard to Trump, it doesn't matter at all to Trump supporters if DeSantis runs. It's his career. He can scuff it up as he likes.

What I see is that Never Trumpers hate Trump so badly that they want to force DeSantis to run, regardless of his chances and without regard for the man's career."
So same as Biden and Clinton before they got their nominations?
"100% correct. They don‚Äôt even care about Trump‚Äôs policies. They like him as a person. Their vote is purely emotional. They‚Äôre much like democrats in that regard. If Trump loses the primary and he told them not to vote for whoever beat him, they wouldn‚Äôt. They don‚Äôt care that policy wise, Desantis or whoever, and Trump, agree on 90% of policy. They don‚Äôt care that democrats overturned just about everything Trump did, from the border to the economy. They would happily hand 2024 to the democrats if Trump lost the primary because their feelings would be hurt, just like Trumps."
But I doubt trump would care to endorse him if he lost again in 2024.
"One lost a primary, one lost to Trump, and the last only barely beat Trump‚Ä¶ not exactly a ringing endorsement of waiting."
"> DeSantis could strike a deal for the Trump endorsement in 2028 by not running in 2024. That would clear the path for him in 2028.

Hahahahahahahaha there is 0 chance Trump will honor that. 

Especially when he loses and cries fraud again. DeSantis knows that shit is unelectable so couldn't go into it too hard and Trump would hold him against it and endorse some loon instead, and the GOP has two more general election losses."
So what you‚Äôre saying is that it‚Äôs a cult.
I‚Äôve seen trumpists on Twitter saying that Trump being indicted means he 100% needs to be the nominee even if he is guaranteed to lose because of the message it says to the ‚Äòswamp‚Äô‚Ä¶
Imagine DeSantis being so weak he couldn‚Äôt convince his own party to vote for him on the national stage rofl.
Was that English?
Yes
They‚Äôre being played like a fiddle by the left.
Imagine being so weak that you're incapable of admitting you lost and spend four years crying stolen elections all before running again knowing darn well you have zero chance of winning the general.
"The Republican primary voters are much further to the right than the November voters are, so to win them you need to support policy that makes you much more likely to lose in November. 

Quite the conundrum. And the base increasingly don't care about electability and just say the result was fraudulent or stolen if they lose so there's never any introspection."
"The populist wing of the GOP are a bunch of cultist RINOs who would vote for a democrat if Trump told them to. 

Also, isn‚Äôt that exactly what happened to Trump with the whole never Trump movement? I mean the suburbs have basically abandoned the GOP thanks to Trump, when the suburbs were the core of the GOP."
Is that not the kind of thing we should be trying to avoid?
Imagine being so weak that your only (not a) chance of gaining ground in support is desperate redditors literally begging people to vote for you every day.
"Ah yes, the ‚ÄòMitt Romney‚Äô argument."
"Is that like the lack of introspection from ""not fraud"" supporters when, to be able to make any semblance of a point, they have to ignore massively significant voting procedures changes toward less election security? Procedures changes that came in the context of DNC State lockdowns and year-long DNC ultra-violent election terrorism."
"Yes, we all remember how wildly successful Romney and McCain were running for president.  Please come back to the real world."
"Yes. I‚Äôm not voting for Trump in the primary. I hope he doesn‚Äôt win. I‚Äôm voting for Desantis and I like Vivek Ramaswamy a lot too. 

That said, if Trump does end up winning the primary I will vote for him in the general because the policies are far more important than the person. I‚Äôm all about voting for whoever has the best chance to end the open borders, the hostility towards the first and second amendments, and the economy killing policies that the democrats seem so fond of. Whether I like the person themselves or not does not make the list of my top 100 concerns."
"Trump has won 1 election and lost the GOP 3.

Not to mention he barely beat Hillary Clinton and lost to the walking corpse of Joe Biden.  McCain was screwed as soon as Lehman went under and Romney was facing a sitting President with approval ratings above 50%. No president loses that scenario. Trump would have lost both of those elections.

Funny enough Trumpists love to hate on Bush when he won 3 out of 4 elections and was the last GOP nominee to win a majority of the popular vote. 

People like you who think Trump is a winner need to come back to the real world."
That's fair. I do think the most important quality of a leader is the ability to unify a people and I'd say we would agree that Trump is a divisive leader. This political war has seeped so much into the everyday life that no one's happy at all. It's rough.
"Bush brought us the Patriot Act and 2 failed wars causing the deaths of millions.  He is correctly remembered as a horrible president.  That is why no one is trying to recreate his corporate neocon GOP.  Their time is passed and I find it funny that someone with a ‚ÄòLibertarian Conservative‚Äô tag is celebrating him.

The only election Trump lost was in the middle of a once in a century pandemic with no end in sight.  No one wins in that environment where everyone is mad and needs an outlet."
"So would you just not vote if Trump were to be the nominee, or would you vote for Biden? Or maybe someone who doesn‚Äôt really have a chance and runs as a 3rd party candidate?"
"Lololol. You honestly believe Trump didn‚Äôt lose in 2018 and 2022?

PS: Afghanistan wasn‚Äôt failed until Trump surrendered to a bunch of terrorists and we are better off now in Iraq than we were in 2003."
It‚Äôs too early for me to speculate on that yet.
"Who did you vote for in 2020, if you don‚Äôt mind me asking? If anyone"
"Key graf: ""They are geographically (and culturally) isolated from the vast majority of Americans. They are highly credentialed, prone to ""egotism and self-absorption,"" loath to admit mistakes and correct them.

They've been absorbed into The Establishment, grown too cozy and incestually involved with the powerful figures they're supposed to be scrutinizing, too aloof and even hostile toward the public they're supposed to serve."""
"Seriously. Can you believe that when one of these ""journalists"" was sued, he defended himself by saying that his program was intended as entertainment and that no reasonable person should believe what he says. Oh wait, that was Tucker Carlson. That is who you're talking about right? Since he is, somehow, the most watched ""news"" program in America that must, by definition, make him mainstream."
Sounds about right
This is a legal problem.   It is fault of the legislature which wrote law allowing this type of defense
"No, the problem is that millions of people still watch and believe someone who has admitted he is a fraud."

It's to defund the local police. They want the feds.
My exact same first thought.

This should be the top comment. California isn't throwing in the towel. California is just the first to signal in on the plan
"California has been the test state for decades and tests new policies etc.

This likely is a test to see how to federal police all the states."

Yes.  The ones that were brought in from another province after the local troops refused to run over ""tank man"" killed a couple thousand young college students and mashed them into pulp under the tank tracks and washed them down the sewer.

Thats not the comparison being made.  The idea that just because the federal troops are ""Americans"" does not mean that somehow prevents them from enforcing totalitarian laws on other Americans.  We are not where China was in the 80s at this point, but we are certain numbers of steps towards getting there.  DC being in charge of local law enforcement certainly pushes us in that direction.  Germany in 1925-1930 was not ready to genocide undesirables either.  If history teaches you nothing else, it should teach you that everyone must be vigilant against any steps toward despotism because it can come very quickly once the fundamentals are in place."

Most people don‚Äôt need to go through what he did for their ailments. They just need to find another recruiter who‚Äôs willing to work for them."
"I believe this because I was in jeopardy of not being able to enlist in 2008 because I had fractured my femur back in 1993.  I had to have all my past records, recent xray and doctors note saying I was cleared and even then the recruiter told me no guarantees.  I was able to get in but damn, I can't imagine how many got rejected."

Doctors are incentivized to transform the human condition into a pharmacological treatment plan. Can‚Äôt focus? It‚Äôs not the sugar, caffeine, or constant assault of 6-15 second video clips, it‚Äôs the ADHD and boy do we have a drug for that! Feeling down? We have a pill for that too!

">  joining the woke military.

And you base this on what? Are you even in the military or are you just parroting what you read about? 

Time and time again I need to say this on here: no one who‚Äôs actually in the military believes that the military has ‚Äúgone woke.‚Äù Coming up on a decade in and don‚Äôt see any evidence of wokeness."
couldn't think of a worse fate then getting drafted and having to possibly die for this country atm. Keep telling your kids avoid military not worth it.
We haven't fought a defensive war since the 1940s.

">With an emphasis physical beauty once more.

I dunno. I grew up in the 80's & 90's. The emphasis on physical beauty was so overwhelming that a lot of us were anorexic or bulimic and hated every last fiber of our being because we didn't look like Kate Moss or Claudia Schiffer."
"My degree is in Supply Chain and the recruiter had told me they were always in need of logistics officers so staying in that field was not going to be a problem. 

I know it‚Äôs not accurate, but I kind of imagine some old army officers in a back room like ‚ÄúOh no, the kid has some slightly splotchy skin, no way he‚Äôll be able to run a logistics team for us with that. Especially in the reserves. His skin is a ticking time bomb of mild irritation and flakiness. We have to bounce him.‚Äù"
"I don‚Äôt know about psoriasis but for eczema, you can have a fairly common but really horrendous and potentially fatal reaction to the smallpox vaccine (or even just close contact with those vaccinated in the last 30 days with it). The military requires smallpox vaccination as far as I‚Äôm aware, which is the main reason I couldn‚Äôt join, even with my super good ASVAB score."
"I was signing up for a logistics officer for one weekend a month and 2 weeks in the summer who already had his own medical insurance through his employer. I therefore wasn‚Äôt necessarily too worried about combat effectiveness lol, but I don‚Äôt mean to come across as not seeing why on a macro-level scale. It‚Äôs just bewildering that they don‚Äôt consider case level basis or at the very least job-type. 

As for that draft timeline, my life situation has changed drastically in the last 4 years, and that is about the furthest thing I want to happen these days. I have a family, a house, and a career now. No way would I consider even doing the reserves anymore due to time constraints. They‚Äôd have to strait draft me these days (something that I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm ineligible for due to my career at a defense contractor anyway)

Will readily admit psoriasis meds (specifically the topical steroids) are expensive as fuuuuuuuuuuck though"
That's dark. Probably not wrong though.
"My comment didn‚Äôt say anything about medical cost that was another guy, friend

Also, I have a form of very localized psoriasis called guttate psoriasis (as opposed to the much more common plaque psoriasis) that doesn‚Äôt cause any discomfort to me at all; it just looks bad when it occasionally flairs up"
Controles mild psoriasis is t really a combat liability
">	Unless they just don‚Äôt want to have to provide gloves.

Honestly that sounds like a good reason, the logistics get very fucky fast"
I had no idea what that disease was so I just went and looked it up and it sounds pretty much exactly like psoriasis as far as physical presenting symptoms are concerned. Is it considered a disqualifying illness as far as the military is concerned?
"Between 2002 and 2008, if you had a heartbeat, they'll take you in. When I enlisted, they found a curvature in my spine. Still got in the Navy."
"I agree with a national service requirement, but I do not believe that American citizens should automatically have to serve in our military. 

Think about how awful some soldiers‚Äô performances are in uniform‚Ä¶ when they actually sought out and enlisted of their own free will. I enlisted because I wanted to fight, and I absolutely HATED it sometimes. You draft young people who vehemently do not want to be there at all, and you end up with the types of recruits like in the film ‚ÄòTigerland,‚Äô or worse. 

Alternative forms of service, such as the Peace Corps, Habitat for Humanity, or similar programs need to be available for those not fit for military service or whom are genuinely against fighting for any cause."

"You remember the embellished story he told the High Times to mess with the stoned reporter who Nugent considered incapable of reporting accurately?

"the conflicts are winnable... if you don't put arbitrary limitations on the military's ability to fight it.  That is why we haven't ""won"" any large scale conflict since ww2."
"Vietnam had a draft. The 20 years of WOT were volunteers. And recruitment didnt fall apart until after the Afghanistan withdrawal. 

Do you think that recruitment would have been as strong during the Vietnam war?"

Korean war was worth it imo.
Actually they had trouble recruiting in 2006
"You are not wrong in discouraging your son.  I wouldn‚Äôt want my child to be in the military today, despite my own military service."
This point cannot be overemphasized.
I served for 6 years and am going back in and I think the army getting caught up in woke nonsense is silly.
"I had to get a waiver for high foot arches back in '98. Then they told me I didn't have depth perception, and killed my chances of ever getting flight crew status. A Naval Commander that was doing his rotation at MEPS at the time was none too happy about the depth perception thing. He had a few choice words about ""how the military was a shell of its former self"". Boy, if he could see it now!"

"After hearing about bootcamp from my brother, you will lose weight with the exercise regime and the prison-like food"
You think Trump wokeified the military?   Oooooookay.
"Biden has made it worse. Respect for joining the military started dropping under Clinton and escalated under Obama with his military operations supporting the Muslim Brotherhood. Recruitment jumped under Trump. It dropped drastically after Biden took office as he immediately took action against conservative military leaders. With the stable base of the military weakened by proclaiming conservatives a threat to democracy, the military has had no choice but to go full woke and recruit degenerates to maintain a minimum troop level. Our enemies are laughing at us going woke. Putin and Iran regularly poke fun at the U.S. because of the degenerate recruitment that the U.S. advertises."
To be fair Draft Dodger and Chief Biden should stay very very far away from anything to do with enlistment.
Nukes. We will never be under threat of direct invasion or assimilation as long as we have a functioning nuclear stockpile.
"It was likely not worth their time to consider a single case. Depending on when you were attempting to join. It's somewhat like hiring managers disregarding resumes based on the smallest of details. When you're hiring for a single position and have 80 applicants, you can be choosy. If you were trying to join between 2001 and 2010, they were absolutely flushed with applicants."
Ohh Sorry ! I was responding to the other guy :/‚Ä¶. Is it noticeable at a glance?‚Ä¶ maybe try getting in again but don‚Äôt mention it. Or say you have dry skin‚Ä¶.. i doubt they are organized enough yo keep track of rejected applicants.

"We could have bombed the Middle East back to the Stone Age, called it a victory and left. Instead we constantly changed the objective."
Fun fact: 2/3 of Americans who fought in Vietnam were volunteers.
Big facts. Recruitment was painful during the surge. That's when entry standards dropped across the board.
"Yep, under Biden, the Army will provide hormone therapy, mental health care and surgeries, for trans people.  The Army has also lowered the entry requirements into the special forces because they are too white."

"Yea it‚Äôs noticeable in the form of several dime-sized pink, scaly patches that are pretty unsightly on my elbows and ribs. That was years ago now though and I‚Äôm not really interested in joining anymore. Just bewildering to me that they don‚Äôt allow someone in based off of that"
Did he hide it under his hair or something at MEPS?
Which is exactly why it won‚Äôt happen
**Ahem* it's to my understanding that these wannabe Socialists don't want rights to begin with. And they just want us to die.
"That seems kind of scorched Earth. Were there any civilians in the Middle East, or should we have just glassed the whole thing and left?"
"Most guys volunteered so they could have a better chance of picking which branch and what they hoped to do (in terms of training and specialty).  Otherwise, you were drafted.  Most of the ‚Äúvolunteers‚Äù were voluntold so that they could potentially avoid a combat infantry unit - but that didn‚Äôt work for many of them anyway."
"Hmmm, that‚Äôs funny; it says honorable discharge on my DD-214. I‚Äôm not a bigot just because I don‚Äôt agree with you about everything. Maybe you should take a knee and change your socks."

"I don't know, I didn't ask him about it. I just remember seeing it on the back of his head."
"No, its unconditional rights for socialists, and no rights and slavery for anyone who does not believe in communism.

Eventually, they're ( Socialists and everyone else) going to have to fight if they want any rights at all. People in this country have had about enough of their BS from the left.

Not sure what will light the fuse, but the fuse is right there, and also a book of matches. Who's going to pick it up is anyone's guess."
"Read up on how many civilians died to the allies during ww2.  The end justifies the means.

War is scorched earth.  Anything less and you are fighting to lose."
"There‚Äôs no way to fight and win a war without some unintended casualties.  There were plenty of civilian noncombatants who were killed in any war.  You do the best you can to avoid it as much as possible, but it can never be eliminated entirely."
"I‚Äôve worked with plenty of LGBTQ+ service members that weren‚Äôt walking talking EO violations. Just because you weren‚Äôt busted for making your edging commentary, doesn‚Äôt mean you deserved an honorable discharge."
"The consequences of your original comment are, indeed, pitiful.

Edit: he blocked me so I have no earthly idea what he said. Someone wanna tell me?"
"That sounds an awful lot like you trying to justify your bloodthirst. Yes, civilians died in previous wars. That doesn't mean we should welcome the idea and not try to prevent it from happening more than what is avoidable.

>The end justifies the means.

You seem like the kind of person that would say something like this to rationalize concentration camps. I mean, you're justifying killing civilians right now, so I guess to you it all makes sense. 

You really have no care for human life, do you?"
"Bombing and glassing an entire section of the planet hardly seems like avoiding it as much as possible. If you're ""bombing the Middle East back to the Stone Age"" it doesn't sound like you care much for anyone that lives in that area, and you're fine with all the civilian deaths as long as they happen over there."
"I wasn‚Äôt busted because I treat everybody with respect and kindness. Get off your high and self righteous horse, POG

Edit: also I didn‚Äôt make the original comment about hosting the pride flag, you dummy. That was somebody else."
Just pissy because someone called you out on the fact that you bitched out of the military and still blame the entry requirements. Not bitter at all. Get over it losewwr
"Stating the truth = bloodlust and rationalizing concentration camps... really dude???

We haven't fought a real war since ww2, the american people don't have the stomach to win the next one.

Edit: ah go figure, brigader..."
And you‚Äôre trying to pick up a turd by the clean end.
"Yeah, making shitty commentary about the pride flag and calling people a POG, I‚Äôm sure you treated everyone with respect and kindness. In reality you were one of those degenerates that dragged the organizations you were part of down with you."
">	you‚Äôre fine with all the civilian deaths as long as they happen over there.

So, people born in the middle east, by virtue of being born where they were, don't deserve the right to live?"
"Once again, I didn‚Äôt make the original comment."
You didn‚Äôt just call me a POG?
"Jesus Christ. I hope you‚Äôre not an officer. 

I didn‚Äôt make the original comment about the pride flag."
"Yeah, you made the commentary on ‚Äòwoke‚Äô nonsense in the military to support commentary on ‚Äòhoisting the pride flag.‚Äô I‚Äôm sorry that the military is removing the barriers of race, gender, and sexual orientation in its ranks, sure would be a shame if we treated folks equally. So again, given your commentary, your service was not appreciated."
"Dude just stop arguing with me and trying to convince me that I‚Äôm less righteous than you just because we have somewhat different perspectives. I don‚Äôt have a problem with people different than me serving. Hell, we‚Äôre all green anyway, we all bleed the same color blood, and our uniforms say US ARMY. That‚Äôs as robust as our social Justice outlook needs to be. I don‚Äôt need to sit in a 2 hour briefing talking about SJW bullshit when I can be room clearing, learning CLS, going over battle drills, or god forbid doing some land navigation lanes. 

And if you think those briefings are more worthwhile for a combat organization, then you‚Äôre more worthy of the POG label I gave you."
"The ‚Äòwe all bleed green‚Äô folks always have an insidious undertone to what they are saying. The fact that you are labeling things as ‚Äòwoke‚Äô and ‚ÄòSJW‚Äô bullshit is evident of that fact that your moral and ethical integrity is questionable. When I joined the military women were marginalized and you weren‚Äôt allowed to serve if you were LGBTQ+. My father‚Äôs military was just coming off of desegregation, which I‚Äôm sure many of the talking points you use against the ‚Äòwoke‚Äô military were used during that timeframe as well. DeSatis‚Äôs team had to define woke in court recently and this is what they provided:

> the belief there are systemic injustices in American society and the need to address them.

So if you think the woke military, which has been working towards allowing equal opportunity to everyone regardless of their race/religion/gender/sexual orientation is a problem (which you have made it clear you do) then once again, your service was a burden to the United States and not an honorable ordeal."
"That‚Äôs where you‚Äôre wrong, kiddo. It was honorable. Says so on my DD-214, and the VA got me this nice home loan at 3% interest. So, I guess go pound sand. You want to feel morally superior to me, go right ahead. You‚Äôre probably just insecure. 

By the way, I see you‚Äôre either stationed in Hawaii or are part of the NG there. I served with the 442nd. If you PM me, I can give you my name and you can go check with the command team there to see if I was the hateful POS you think I seem to be. I was with D Co and HHC. Shouldn‚Äôt be too hard to find out whatever you want to know. What you‚Äôll hear is that I was a model soldier whom everybody liked or looked up to."
"Ok have it your way, big shot."
Holy shit what a loser üòÇ
"Show me where I made a disparaging remark. All I said was the Army has too many briefings about woke nonsense. Me saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good use of time to have briefings for less than a percent of the population,‚Äù isn‚Äôt the same thing as me attacking them. But to you, anybody who doesn‚Äôt 100% agree with you has failed some ideological purity test and is a bigot. 

It absolutely pains me to see my Army have leaders like you. You don‚Äôt have any rational ability and you‚Äôd be a disaster in a combat scenario. I hope to god you aren‚Äôt in the combat arms because you‚Äôd get real soldiers killed."

"My biggest problem with him was his inaction in almost every scenario. When the vaccine rollout was happening, he fell in line with the proposed status quo.

Banning things is almost never the right solution. Personal freedom FTW
"I've always been interested in the development of lab grown meat, anything that will bring the price of beef down! As for bugs, I've always seen them as better used in livestock feed. It is indeed a great source of cheap protein, so why not feed it to pigs and cows?"

Agreed. Personal choice is paramount. Just don't force me to eat shit by artificially raising/lowering prices or try to fool me by substituting it for real food. I'm even hopeful that lab meat could be cheaper if - and ONLY if - it's able to perfectly reproduce normal meat. I'd totally be up for cheaply printing expensive and delicious cuts of meat like wagyu.

"Seriously. I don't give a shit if someone eats lab grown meat or crickets. I've had seasoned crickets in Mexico and thought they were a delightful snack. Give me a lab grown steak that tastes the same or better with the same nutritional value at the same or better price, I'll eat that shit too."

"Lab grown meat is literally just meat. Meat is just a collection of certain cells growing in a certain matter.

If you can grow those same cells in a laboratory setting, you can just grow the exact same meat, just with less overhead of having to grow the rest of the animal."
"It's real meat, but cultivated in a lab rather than an animal. Just like every other innovation it will improve over time. In a decade it will probably taste just as good or better and be cheaper to produce. Also, the quality will be very consistent. I don't see a downside to it once it's a mature product."

"You are right. Generally conservatives wouldn't legislate food bans.

But I think it's more of a protection strategy for small time local Italian farmers who know the WEF corporate funded insect/ lab grown meat industry will wipe them out without pre-emptive government intervention.

Italy is already struggling economically, the last thing it needs is agricultural and rural collapse."
"I think I agree with you. They should have required labeling on the packages, but not outright banned it. People have a right to know what‚Äôs in their food but also a right to eat whatever they want too"
"If you know Italy at all, there is no way that lab grown meat would ever be marketed or sold as such. It would almost definitely be used as ""counterfeit meat"". There is very little appetite for this sort of ""progress"" in a place like italy, where people already are skeptical of anything they didn't see growing somewhere nearby. If you want an example of this in action, just look into the olive oil industry. The provenance of produce is so important in italy that there are entire industries around fake olive oil, largely controlled by the mafia. It's absolutely wild."
"Fair point.

However, the people pushing crickets and fake meat do not share this view. They will attempt to ban meat. At best they will aim make the only meat available free range/ grass fed meat as to make it so expensive only the elites will afford it."

It would be great if they took all such subsidies away for the industries.
Yea I mean of it tastes good and isn't poison then why not? Think of the opportunities in food insecure nations. That and many insects are high In protein and healthy for you. I've had pasta made from cricket flower and I have to say it was pretty good.
Do you think they‚Äôll tell us which meat is which?
"For some people, process of it being from a killed animal is important for the meat consumption. That is why it is a contention to call lab grown animal culture meat. 

It is same reason italy also banned GM corn and other genetically engineered crops.

They tend to be very Luddite in their approach."
Tbh insects are a billion times bettter than high fructose corn trash poison.
"No, that's from eating too much."
"Advocating for restrictions on what people can eat can be viewed as authoritarian because it involves using the power of the government to control individuals' personal choices and behaviors. In a free society, individuals should have the right to make their own decisions about what they eat, without fear of punishment or coercion.

It's important to consider the practical implications of such restrictions. Enforcing laws or regulations on what people can eat would require significant government resources and could infringe upon personal privacy and autonomy. It would also raise questions about who gets to decide what is and isn't allowed, as well as the potential for abuse of power."
"If anything lab grown will be healthier with a lower chance for disease and the ability to edit out the more problematic aspects of meat. The level of protein can also be controlled to provide more protein per gram.

You end up with a food that can taste the same as regular meat and cause fewer health/environmental/ethical issues. Something the country really needs.

"Natural ‚â† healthy. Plenty of natural things are *very* unhealthy (like most viruses and diseases); plenty of lab-made foods and items are simply better than their ""natural"" counterparts.

Finally, the meat you eat today isn't anywhere close to natural. Just about every strain of farm animal has gone through literal centuries of selective breeding (ie deliberate and scientific genetic alteration) to be fatter and unhealthier than ever before. Many chickens, cows, etc today are so heavily mutated that their legs can't even support how fat we have bred them to be. They simply collapse from their weight and lie in their own waste.

99% of the meat people eat today comes from these heavily mutated animals."
The idea that natural equals healthy has no basis in reality. Some of the most toxic substances on the planet quite literally grow from the ground.
"One well-studied part of evolution is antagonistic pleiotropy, which is a phenomenon where a genetic adaptation can have a positive short-term effect on reproductive success but negative long-term effects on health. If we have more adaptations to a given food, that increases the likelihood that one or more of those adaptations has this trade-off. Novel foods haven't been adapted to beyond the nutrients they are composed of. So, if an ancestral food and novel food had the same nutrients and had not been studied for long-term health outcomes, I'd wager on the novel food having better long-term health outcomes on average."
"Ever hear of mad cow?  Ran through Britain in the 70s, 80s, and 90s, and likely will continue to be problematic for a while.  You would never have to worry about such an issue with lab grown meat. Diseases, contamination through food chain issues (PFAS, for instance), and other such issues also aren't present in lab grown meat.

Im not advocating to replace the meat industry with lab grown meat at all, ultimately don't care much outside of potential use cases where actual meat isn't viable (space travel, for instance, would have a huge benefit from this), and don't advocate on any moralistic grounds. However the arguments posed against it are beyond silly and just utterly ignorant.

There is no reason to ban it outright, and banning insecta is even dumber (as they are *already* a staple food source through our the world). Require labeling? Sure, that's fine. I'm an advocate for people knowing what they are eating. Banning it is just ridiculous."

Yeah exactly that‚Äôs what I thought too. You don‚Äôt have to agree with the product but if there is a demand for it on the open market then who are we to tell them no?
I‚Äôm not vegan or vegetarian myself but you should be aware that red meat is classed as a 2A carcinogen meaning there is a probable cancer link. Any departure from that is an improvement in my opinion. I don‚Äôt think I would buy this stuff either but if you‚Äôre genuinely concerned about the consumer‚Äôs health then there are far more dangerous foods to be worried about.
"This is just plain silly, and school-cbild level logic. Your body evolved mechanisms to break down and process proteins into amino acids, and create protein out of amino acids. That's it. Whatever form those proteins are in does not particularly matter, outside of certain forms of protein (plants, for instance) being more difficult to extract.  

Lab grown meat will have no real difference on a cellular, molecular, etc. Level as compared to real meat. Lab grown meat is literally just animal muscle protein cultured in a lab, given nutrients it needs to produce cell mitosis, and mechanisms in place to further encourage the development of this tissue. The end result is literally just a wad of animal muscle cell tissue of the constituent animal, largely no different than a chicken nugget.  There is no reason in the world your body would have a problem digesting it, as it is actual animal tissue.

This is like saying we can't digest pastes made from animal meat because we didn't evolve to eat meat paste. The actual digestive process doesn't give a crap about the physical form of the protein."

It's not synthetic. It's not like they created fake muscle tissue. It is actual animal meat protein and actual tissue on a cellular level. All they really do is culture muscle tissue in a lab setting and grow it in a machine while giving it nutrients that muscle tissue needs for cellular growth. Thats it.

Second, being the leading candidate for a party doesn‚Äôt mean you aren‚Äôt ALSO a criminal or doing illegal things. 

I wholeheartedly hope that we do start seeing more charges and evidence being provided against anyone who has broken the law. If anything we should be holding our reps to an even higher standard."

‚ÄúCBS staff not allowed to accurately portray the news‚Äù FTFY
They're afraid facts will lead to wrongthink.
"Because they aren‚Äôt interested in reporting facts. 

Nothing new here."
Right but they can always fall back on the straight white male narrative when needed.
"Hiding the facts, they only show and tell what they want you to see and hear."
"Don't care. A transgender murdered Evelyn Dieckhaus, 9; Mike Hill, 61; William Kinney, 9; Katherine Koonce, 60; Cynthia Peak, 61; and Hallie Scruggs, 9.

I have no sympathy and anyone who is trying to victimize the murderer or make sure we don't offend the T crowd can go to hell."
They are so proud to virtue signal though. Hmmmm
That‚Äôs fine use ‚Äúshe‚Äù
"I haven't believed ~~state propaganda~~ the media since the Snowden leaks, but how can anyone believe them given they're opposed to telling the truth as a matter of corporate policy?"
"My God have you seen what the White House has been tweeting? If you were on a desert island and just got rescued, you‚Äôd think a Christian just shot up and killed a school full of transgenders. It‚Äôs amazing"
"So much for trans visibility, I guess."
If they refer to the person in their original gender then I see no issue but am betting they won‚Äôt

Of course that's a double standard, but doublespeakers just call it a standard."
Can't have the masses knowing inconvenient facts. They might start making opinions that differ from the narrative
I haven‚Äôt watched CBS News in over a decade. Thanks for the enlightenment on what I‚Äôm not missing.
CBS is erasing transgender people! I hear that qualifies as actual genocide!
"Go ahead, MSM - we all see what‚Äôs going on though. They think they so slick."
Surprise!
Big media knows what‚Äôs best for you
That‚Äôs weird. You mean the mouth piece for ~~the country‚Äôs real owners~~ large corporations has to tailor it‚Äôs message so as not to step on any toes? Wouldn‚Äôt want to see the byproducts of DEI.
Of course. Can‚Äôt offend the sacred community‚Äôs feelings/ delusions and have them acknowledge that the rhetoric being spread by them and radical activists (that there is a coordinated attack on them via the legislation being passed regarding sports and bathroom usage) is dangerous.
"TBF, this is consistent with the, in my opinion silly, notion that ""transmen are men"" and ""transwomen are women"".  I.e. ""transman"" and ""transwoman"" have now become defunct."
An act of terror fueled by hate was commited on innocent children and adults & they're still afraid to criticize mental health related to the LGBT community.
"The shooting has already disappeared from all the major news outlets.  The manifesto probably won‚Äôt be released until we all have forgotten, if ever."
"Unless the shooting was motivated in some way by a transgender issue, such as retaliation by an individual of whom was psychologically damaged due to bullying or harassment, there is no connection; and therefore no reason to bring the transgender element into the discussion. Doing so only manages to create an illusion of the connection, most especially to people of lesser intellect with a desire to project their negative viewpoint on the subject. It would largely be irresponsible to suggest it as relevant.

An example could be to single out another trait as if to suggest a connection to singular events of intense negative outcomes as though they were in some way relevant to the event:

‚ÄúThe perpetrator was a white male who was for years deprived of sex from his wife, being morbidly obese with club feet and erectile disfunction.‚Äù

It‚Äôs probably fair that none of the above has any connection between many persons causing mass shootings, so it‚Äôs probably fair that a person being transgender also has no connection, either; and is therefore irrelevant.

Those who desire a connection because it helps them feel better knowing there‚Äôs something else to negatively connect to something they don‚Äôt like are projecting their intolerance and bigotry about something that doesn‚Äôt affect them in their lives in any measurable or meaningful way."
"Nobody should use any words or names to describe any mass shooters, ever. That notoriety is exactly what they want. From the moment they open fire they should be called fuckwit #1, fuckwit #2 and so on, and their names should vanish from history."
"It's only important if you think being transgender is the reason why this awful child murderer did what they did. The murderer was supposedly autistic as well. Does that need to be in every headline. Could be that it's no more important than than their age..their bloodtype..their economic background etc.

I feel like some want to use this evil person's transgender history to attack a whole group of people not responsible for child murders. Pretty shameful imo."
2800+cisgender gun mass murders. What does gender have to do with anything unless you‚Äôre speedrunning 1930s?

Sort of like Fox News

Uh-huh‚Ä¶.
I missed the part where your comment has anything to do with this article. So you're saying it's ok to falsely report the news because they're on your team? Or wrong either way?
Don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre being downvoted. Proven in court. Pretty straightforward
"Seems the popular talking point for pro-trans Twitter, subreddits, and discord is trying to minimize it by saying the shooter was probably sexually abused at the school.

I've seen:

""look I don't condone the shooting, but I get where he is coming from""

""The shooter left a manifest. Manifesto's are usually right wing, just saying.""

And basically a bunch of people just fear mongering that  this shooting will be used to genocide trans people.

It's fucking crazy. These groups have been doom posting about arming up and killing the facists that want to ""destroy"" them. Then a trans person goes and shoots up Christians and the whole community tries to backpedal and act like it was all cupcakes and peace before."
">it stepped way up sometime in the 2010‚Äôs

If you are looking for an exact date - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_Wall_Street

When the elites realized people were no longer fighting against each other but were focusing on the real problem - the elites themselves - that is when everything changed."
"I've gotten a few replies from child killing apologists but I guess they were removed, deleted or blocked. 

To answer some of them, if it's wrong at all to point out the murderer was trans, why does your side get so giddy and arrogant when it comes to a white person being the shooter. Yall been real fucking quiet this year since most of the mass shootings have been perpetrated by non whites and lgbtq members. You don't actually give a damn about children. You give a damn about pushing degeneracy and sympathizing with lunatics. 

And before some demfuck says I never cared til now, you're dead wrong. I never had to call child killers monsters in the past because it was agreed by all of us that that is not cool. Not anymore."
"Either that or they‚Äôll just say it was a gun, as if it were just floating around not being controlled by a person.

‚ÄúAn assault rifle entered the school, shot and killed 6 people before police shot the gun and put a stop to it‚Äù"
"I kept seeing ""Ex Student"" in the headlines.  Then they disable the comments on those articles."
"It‚Äôs absolutely disgusting. Everyone should be spitting on this things grave. Just imagine being a parent of one those killed kids and then watching blue hair crazies storm a government center then hold up the number 7. You know 7, as in 7 people that died that day. It‚Äôs the equivalent of Murderer sympathy."
Nothing like victim shaming
It's an irrelevant fact that only shows that men are more violent than women (not that your brain will process that fact though)
Link them please.
"So they are claiming a trans person was the victim of conservative hate?

You're all on a sub where you hate on trans people.  

Someone can be a victim of right wing bigotry and also be a murderer.  Those aren't exclusive conditions."

"Will they? Do we ask that *now* about why people didn't just say ""no"" to the red guard in Mao's great leap forward?"

Not a *person*. Only Monsters murder children. Your perceived, indirect, amorphous, entirely ignorable ""conservative hate"" (as if thats not a two way street) doesn't justify killing children, despite how much the entireity of your ideologically bankrupt filth will consistently try to do exactly that when it comes to a trans shooter"
Idk We don‚Äôt condone killing because a vote doesn‚Äôt go our way like the left.  This is a result of the lefts divisive rhetoric.
"It's not ""bigotry"" to tell someone that they are harming themselves. It's called caring. I won't be telling a woman she can be a man if she wants, because that is lying and causing permanent damage to her."
"The murderer got shot because that‚Äôs what she deserved. She was NOT a victim one bit. The police did their job, and they did it well."
"I don't. And if there is, it will be the history of The State, which will just be propaganda"
"History 101 2123 version.

And so, with the stolen election of 2020, the Communist virus dropped on the world, a paid off president and willing paid legislators the Chinese Communist Party took total control of America in 2028......"
"History classes of whatever nation comes out on top will. Ours certainly won't. I feel like, barring a revolution, our country's fate is sealed. 

There's nothing that can stop the momentum of the western communist movement because both the education system and the mainstream media are complicit. Children and young adults parrot communist propaganda because they've been forcefed it so much they believe it."
"Interesting.

At least during that election, states didn‚Äôt illegally change election law"
"I'm just amazed that you haven't noticed, in 15 years, that Reddit is an authoritarian left-wing WOKE censorship addict."

Aye. I got banned from two subs because I had posted in a sub that was anti-COVID narrative.

"Every time I see a ‚ÄúX character did nothing wrong‚Äù video on YouTube I die inside a little bit.

"I used to like Colbert's show when he first started to host his own program. He broke the fourth wall to share some frankly terrible opinions even then, but at least most of what he did was parody of the mainstream news, and it was pretty funny because they've always been easy to laugh at. And while he lampooned President Bush in ways that some people would say were deeply disrespectful to the office, let's face it, Dubya tried to hard to spin his public persona and was an eminently memeable figure.

Then Obama won the presidency in 2008 and Colbert did a 180, becoming just another attack dog faithfully serving the administration in power, every night savaging the enemy of the hour. And it's just been downhill since there. I've seen YouTube clips once or twice since 2020 and I don't think he even does any parody at all anymore. It's all just rants about how the party in power knows best and the opposition are all scum that ought to curl up and die.

You've got to have a lot of ignorance and anger in your heart for a show like that to appeal to you."
That show is 100% political content.  Why is it even called comedy?  He isn‚Äôt doing any comedy at all.  Just political opinion.
The lemmings are entertained.
"This is what CBS thinks of you, folks.  They hate Conservatives and don't want our viewership or money.  Turn the channel!!!"

"how is this shit still on tv? just google the ratings, most late night shows barely even scratch a million viewers, hell Fallon (on googling) says around 1.something million? Out of 300+ million people these late night hacks can stay on the air with virtually nobody watching them. Time to move on, it's 2023, just replay sit coms."
Colbert hasn‚Äôt told a proper joke since he left Comedy Central.
We're supposed to be surprised that people with that would attend his show would erupt in applause over this?  That's like being surprised that a New York City jury is likely to convict Trump no matter what the evidence is
It's really rather pathetic and embarrassing for them that they put their mental defect on display like it's something to be proud of.
"The same people who watch Colbert are the same ones who voted for Fetterman, braindead."
"Lol, that dude's been praying for Trump to get indicted for anything for almost  a decade... I remember a few years back when Trump was president and youtube kept pushing me his videos it would always be, ""The Russian investigation is just one step away from finding Trump guilty of treason.""

"Unabomber manifesto spoke about this all the way back in 1995. A rather good read, all things considered."
"Imo it‚Äôs actually deeper than that, it shows how many on the left view the rule of law and the judicial system more broadly. They don‚Äôt believe in equal justice under the law or innocent until proven guilty, they only view court decisions as a way to legitimize their pre existing beliefs. 

The parallels between how they view courts and how the Nazis viewed courts are undeniable. 

[People‚Äôs Courts - Nazi Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Court_(Germany))

> The proceedings of the court were often even less than show trials in that some cases, such as that of Sophie Scholl and her brother Hans Scholl and fellow White Rose activists, trials were concluded in less than an hour without evidence being presented or arguments made by either side. The president of the court often acted as prosecutor, denouncing defendants, then pronouncing his verdict and sentence without objection from defense counsel, who usually remained silent throughout. The court almost always sided with the prosecution, to the point that, from 1943 on, being brought before it was tantamount to a death sentence. While Nazi Germany was not a rule of law state, the People's Court frequently dispensed with even the nominal laws and procedures of regular German trials and is therefore characterized as a kangaroo court.[2]

> **There was no presumption of innocence nor could the defendants adequately represent themselves or consult counsel. A proceeding at the People's Court would follow an initial indictment in which a state or city prosecutor would forward the names of the accused to the Volksgerichtshof for charges of a political nature**. Defendants were hardly ever allowed to speak to their attorneys beforehand and when they did the defense lawyer would usually simply answer questions about how the trial would proceed and refrain from any legal advice.

>The People's Court proceedings began when the accused were led to a prisoner's dock under armed police escort. The presiding judge would read the charges and then call the accused forward for ""examination"". Although the court had a prosecutor, it was usually the judge who asked the questions. **Defendants were often berated during the examination and never allowed to respond with any sort of lengthy reply.** After a barrage of insults and condemnation, the accused would be ordered back to the dock with the order ""examination concluded"".[citation needed]

>After examination, the defense attorney would be asked if they had any statements or questions. Defense lawyers were present simply as a formality and hardly ever rose to speak. The judge would then ask the defendants for a statement during which time more insults and berating comments would be shouted at the accused. The verdict, which was almost always ""guilty"", would then be announced and the sentence handed down at the same time. In all, an appearance before the People's Court could take as little as fifteen minutes.

But then again, I did take a lot of religion courses as high school electives and learned more about world history in those courses than I did in any of my history courses."
"From the article:

>""You'll no doubt find that the Bible, under Utah Code Ann. ¬ß 76-10-1227, has 'no serious values for minors' because it's pornographic by our new definition.""

It looks like the parent was pointing out the hypocrisy of characterizing everything that had any ""adult"" elements as being ""porn,"" and not actually calling the bible pornographic.  Similar to the issues of the statue of David people are currently arguing about.

ETA:  Take a look at [https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title76/Chapter10/76-10-S1227.html?v=C76-10-S1227\_1800010118000101](https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title76/Chapter10/76-10-S1227.html?v=C76-10-S1227_1800010118000101) which clearly provides that (by definition) the description of ""sexual intercourse"" (as in the case of Lot's daughters in Genesis 19:30-36) renders a work as indecent and unable to have any serious value for minors.  At least David's statue escapes that *automatic* characterization by falling under section 1227(b)(i)(A).  Anyone else see the problem here in writing laws without considering the unintended consequences?"
I just never really realized that the Bible was in my school library if it ever was.
Well this post got invaded quickly by the mob
Haven‚Äôt schools already banned the Bible?
"There's books that have different age-appropriate Bible stories, could always have those available instead and let learning the entire Bible be a decision parents make on their own, at home.

But that suggestion doesn't mean I think the Bible is 'porn'."
Ignore
I'm dead x.x
"Andrew Klavan had a great response to this that I‚Äôll paraphrase: 

The Bible has many unpleasant things in it but not porn. Porn titillates but is without humanity; it only serves to sexually stimulate you and provides no deeper connection beyond that. The Song of Solomon is sensual but is also filled with love and humanity.

Edit: Hi r/politics! I guess you live here with us now, huh?

Edit2: To the unflaired smartasses, please tell me more about how porn starring the stepmom and stepson serves a higher purpose from your sexual gratification and doesn‚Äôt corrode your soul. üôÑ"
"Haha, LDS people barely know the real Bible soooo üòÇ"
Must have missed the chapters that covered instructions on how to perform oral sex.
A lot of brigadiers in the comments pretending to be conservatives. It‚Äôs a shame they don‚Äôt have a real life outside of making other people hate them. Kinda sad really
"There‚Äôs a vast difference between discussing perversions and using them to illustrate immoral behavior & a manga illustrating blowjobs to be ‚Äúinclusive‚Äù & dare I say, to arouse."
How?
"I've heard this alot. But I don't know where they're getting this from. I'm pretty sure the ones who engaged in this behavior in the Bible were smited or punished, but I'm no scholar"
"There is a difference between porn‚Äîwhich is dehumanizing material designed to titillate for sexual gratification‚Äîand historical descriptions of actual humans behaving frightfully as fallen humans do. So no, the Bible isn‚Äôt porn, and no it shouldn‚Äôt be removed from schools any more than the newspaper that reports about teachers being arrested for having sex with their students should.

This sub sucks. There are no conservatives in it, and nobody here has thought for one second about what is worth conserving or why. This is a playground for self-idolizing, zeitgeist-chasing, incurious adolescents. 

There should be a litmus test that one must pass before posting here that proves the person has read and understands Buckley‚Äôs ‚ÄúGod and Man at Yale‚Äù for instance."
Bible is pg 12 in the book world. Just stating a fact.
What school has the Bible ?
"I have never read anything in the Bible that could not be read aloud in a school board meeting. I think that the criteria should be if it can be read aloud in a school board meeting, it should be allowed in school libraries. If parents don‚Äôt want their children to read certain books, parents should have the right to restrict  their children by giving the librarian a list of books that they don‚Äôt want their children to access. They should not have the power to choose books that my child may access. 

If a book cannot be read aloud in a school board meeting, it has no place on a student library."
People tend to forget it is an adult book we disneyfy for kids.
Graphic does not necessarily mean pornographic.
That really made me chuckle
"History of religion is important to be taught in schools, and the Bible is a primary source."
So it's authoritarian to ban books with pornographic images in elementary/middle schools? That's really what we're going with huh?
"What a hot take. Children should be introduced to all walks of life guys, else it's authoritarian. The concept of ""mature content"" is outdated guys. Reddit troll has deemed it authoritarian.

Do the brigaders that followed you over actually believe in that? That is seriously enlightening that leftists on reddit believe this. What a sheltered unimaginably boring life you have lived if you think basic standards of moderation for children is authoritarian. I truly pity you."
"Im old enough to remember the great censoring that occured from ""seperation of church and state"" its same old game."
"It‚Äôs quite bad at this point isn‚Äôt it?

I‚Äôve been seeing normal positive comments get to -8"
At least our hair color is a natural color.
"No, the Bible is probably in most school libraries."
I think libraries tend to have religious books in a reference section which this will ban other books as well.
That sounds like a great compromise.
Gone now ;)
"I can still see a fair argument against letting children be exposed to the Old Testament. Or at least parts of it. Not something I‚Äôd agree with necessarily but there‚Äôs a fair argument that exposing children to that kind of material is unwise. Same goes for the newspapers in that context too though.

A bible with prescribed reading for different ages isn‚Äôt bad. It‚Äôs something I did every morning for years. When I was older I had to read it front to back and it genuinely wasn‚Äôt that bad to do. Song of Solomon was insanely titillating for someone just entering puberty though!"
"Ezekiel 23:20, I look forward to you quoting it at the next school board meeting."
Hey she‚Äôs a serious actress now. How dare you add to Mia‚Äôs trauma!?!?
"I wouldn't even necessarily say Disneyfy, but it's impossible for a child to actually just pick up The Bible and read it like a normal book. A lot of it is incredibly dry with archaic language and the size makes it intimidating, which is why The Bible has traditionally always been read to even adults as a guided experience."
But that applies to a lot of books that are being pulled due to these laws. It's pretty obvious that this is just a stunt to draw attention to how stupidly these laws are written/applied.
Is that where the bans in certain districts ended?
Separation of church and state doesn't mean schools can't have religious materials
"I highly doubt they do. Especially elementary school libraries which is what these bills are talking about.

It‚Äôs not like the books are being banned from public libraries."
"This isn‚Äôt about ‚ÄúLibraries‚Äù in general. This is about specifically the age appropriateness of content available to kids various levels of school and their school Libraries.  None of these books are ‚Äúbanned‚Äù like they can‚Äôt be sold or found in public libraries.  

While public libraries do have the Bible and other religious books, it‚Äôs highly unlikely that elementary school libraries do."
"That's my major issue with ""sola scriptura"" theology. The text doesn't stand alone and we need a guide."
"The bill as I understand it bans pornographic material for all minors 18 and younger in schools. While I don't necessarily agree that certain material should be banned for high schoolers, it's silly to call it authoritarian.

It's well established that certain rights can be limited for minors (owning guns for example). I don't believe anyone would argue that outright porn should be available in schools, so obviously (I think) we all agree that a line needs to be drawn somewhere. Utah just so happens to want to draw that line on the more conservative side."
I agree. Im saying the censoring of material is SSDD
Lmao. He never punished Lot or his daughters for their sins. He destroys Sodom and Gomorrah but only after Lot and his daughters flee. There are never any consequences for their actions.

"Can we please not have 50 freaking candidates running again? Just muddying the water of an already messy situation.

I also want to know why all these not at all known candidates  run when it's very clear that i the presidency bid for the Republican party is going to come down to Trump and Desantis. It only serves to peel votes away from those two.. and that's how trump won last time. So if this guy's running to oppose him, he's most likely helping him instead."
Same here!
"The more people run, the more likely Trump will win the plurality and be the nominee. So if that‚Äôs what you want, then yea - more people is better. But if you want DeSantis, all of these extras need to drop out early and throw their weight behind him."
"AND YET, that would be more than the current Vice President got. Her own father voted against her."

Hey look i found the brigader!
Seems like this is something you can easily check yourself
"The awards always give it away lol. Wouldn‚Äôt shock me if there are bots that search for ‚Äúbetter than Trump‚Äù and slap an award on it.

And this is coming from someone who doesn‚Äôt want Trump to be the nominee."
"Nice try, nope."
"Yeah, that's weird. Probably are bots. All anonymous."
Of course peace is what you want but you don't want to surrender for it. It's like if Russia invaded the US and they took over Alaska and tried to invade the lower 48 but got stopped in Canada. We wouldn't just surrender Alaska for the sake of peace?
Seems like a reasonable position for an invaded country that believes it can reclaim territory that is occupied by an enemy. Wouldn‚Äôt we fight just as hard for our country?
"Wow this article totally isn't biased or anything.  Hyperbole isn't good reporting. Its been a year. That is not a ""Forever war"". Putin has said that either he won't negotiate at all or that he will only negotiate if the world hands him even more of Ukraine then he already has. On the flip side the Ukrainians probably think they can take more of their country back from the Russians and aren't likely to accept a deal where the Russians keep everything they have.  Being cynical that negotiations would go anywhere is not shocking at this stage."
None of these people are anywhere near gunfire.
Why would they they are making billions from us funding them
They want to fight to the last man I guess.
">Wouldn‚Äôt we fight just as hard for our country?

We probably wouldn't have another country sending us a seemingly endless supply of cash and weapons, so probably not.

It's easy for Ukraine to say they want to keep the war going forever when another country is footing the bill."
">Its been a year. That is not a ""Forever war"".

It sure as hell is if neither side wants to negotiate for peace and the US and other Western nations keep supply Ukraine with endless cash and weapons and the rest of the world keeps buying Russian oil.

Given all of the above, the only way this war ends is if Russia starts using nukes."
"For war?

The money disappears into overly-expensive military equipment while the ones on the field get peanuts (if they come back at all).

No one wants to risk getting slaughtered in the fields, period."
"Ukraine is fighting for their family, their nation, and their freedom.  Wouldn‚Äôt you do the same if Russia invaded your state and raped your wife, kidnapped your children and murdered your father and brothers?  Or would you just surrender meekly because you don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúfight to the last man‚Äù."
Our European allies backed us in Afghanistan‚Ä¶ I feel like they‚Äôd be more eager to do what they could during an actual invasion of our homeland.
"You would think after over 1 year of war, literally one year plus - someone would have done or won something by now ‚Ä¶ 

Over 30 years ago we beat Iraq in less than a week. With that equipment. Over a larger area. 

Something is fishy I‚Äôm sorry. 

These are potential reasons:

1. Russia is more competent & has more weapons than we were told.

2. Ukraine is wildly incompetent.

This should have ended a long time ago either way. But we‚Äôre being lied to. Even USA weapons that are 10-20 years old should have annihilated Soviet era 1968 tanks by now or no?

Our drones and intelligence are there. This is fact.

So‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs really happening?

Front line news has been pretty scarce for quite some time now. Personally, I‚Äôd lean toward government & media lies."
Please. Half this sub would throw their daughters to the orcs if they thought it would make their gas and eggs cheaper.
">Wouldn‚Äôt you do the same

Depends on the area that was invaded and occupied. San Fransisco? Nope! Russia or any other country can go ahead and keep that shithole. It would really hurt the invading country more than it would hurt us to let them keep it."
">Our European allies backed us in Afghanistan‚Ä¶

""Helping"" us in Afghanistan is peanuts compared to what we would require if there were an actual invading force that could compete with our military.

I'm sure NATO would suddenly dissolve if the US were actually successfully invaded and we needed help. Our military is probably stronger than the entire rest of NATO combined. Those countries aren't going to want to piss off an invading force that can actually take on our military."
What? This is so backwards I'm almost convinced its sarcastic/a joke/satire.
Hahahahahah
"You didn‚Äôt answer my question.  So again, what if Russia invaded YOUR state, raped your wife, kidnapped your children, murdered your brother and father, would you ‚Äúfight to the last man‚Äù or just meekly surrender?"
"Well, why hasn‚Äôt there been an outcome yet ? It‚Äôs 2023 not 1943"
"Ask the Russians. They tried to end the war fast and failed hilariously. Learning the hard way that lightning campaigns require an overwhelming advantage in at least most of the following: equipment, air superiority, strategic planning, troop training and logistics. They appear to have met none of these criteria. 


&nbsp;

 Trying to compare the Ukrainians to the US military in desert storm because we have sent them what amounts to a small number of weapons compared to their overall military size is an absolute joke. In desert storm we had thousands of M1A1 Abrams and Bradley IFVs backed up by the strongest air force in human history. And thats before we talk about our coalition allies. The Ukrainians have 0 western tanks on the battlefield and their air force air force is basically irrelevant at this stage.  They do not have an overall advantage in technology or numbers. Not a decisive one by any means.

&nbsp;

A war where neither side has an effective air force and neither side has an overwhelming advantage is not going to end in a week. The sides are too equally matched on the front. Look at how the Iran-Iraq war went instead of desert storm. That war went on for 8 years just so you know."
"So in 2023 no one has a jet? Okay.

Well if that‚Äôs the case then the rest of the world is truly backwards and you‚Äôd be right.

Guess so!"
"They have Jets. The Russians also have a metric fuckton of SAMs and AAA(IADS). The Russian air force is having the same problem with Ukrainian IADS.  This is leading to neither side being able to impact the war in a major way from the air. 


&nbsp;

 In the gulf war the USAF and USN were able to overcome a similar situation with overwhelming airpower and airborne electronic warfare combined with drones, stealth aircraft and cruise missiles. Neither side in the Ukraine war is capable of that level of operations or has the advanced technology required in anywhere near the required amounts. The Ukrainians simply don't have the equipment and while the Russian air force has it on paper they have shown themselves to be rather incompetent in actually using their air power to any real effect.

&nbsp;

The USAF and USN are far and away the most powerful air forces in the world.  It isn't even a contest. No one else can do what they do on the scale they do it on.

&nbsp;

In one way you can sort of say this is what Desert Storm might have looked like if the coalition forces did not have the overwhelming air superiority that they did. Though that would also be discounting the coalition's superiority in land warfare equipment and training."

"Trans day of visibility was on Friday. Today was the follow up protests ""trans day of vengence ""

2 separate events."
"While it's nice to see so many liberals being redpilled lately (Bill Maher, Elon Musk, JK Rowling, Ricky Gervais, Russell Brand, etc), you are correct in blaming them for this mess. They spent decades trying to act like their side was the side of morality and proper history, all while denying any claims of slippery slopes

Same goes out to the women who wholeheartedly supported this whole gender stuff, and are now losing their spaces and privacy to men. It's like, yes we gotta protect them from the predators, but you can't help but point and laugh at them getting their comeuppance for enabling this nonsense. It's petty and not at all conservative to do, but they truly brought this up on themselves despite our repeated warnings"
"Yeah, imagine all the undercover FBI agents getting fat on a 2ft stack of flapjacks."
Some J6 attendees are in jail for far less than pancakes.
"MAGA day of visibility?

Are you trying to make a totally invisible group that the news media never talks about feel totally invisible because they're totally not the center of attention and never get constant praise and affirmation because they're totally stunning and brave and underacknowledged.

Because I kind of want popcorn now."
"You‚Äôre right, the hyperbolic response would be equally ridiculous"
"The guy with horns almost toppled the US military, installing Trump as a dictator.  I'll never forget 1/6."
"Hello, Mr. Epps!"
Was that what it was? I didn't get my brochure from the FBI.
"I know, right? We saw it happen live!"
"Cause many people aren't paying enough attention to realized that our mortal enemies are trying to destroy America from within.  It isn't that they would not recognize the problem if they saw it, but that they're just not looking."
This has been proven time and again.  Just send in some bikers and they'll be crying for the police they want to defund.
"""I don't know what sex i am, but I'm a totally credible source of facts"""
There really is no bottom to the insanity. Shudder to think what the future holds.
"I mean, they wanted their day of vengeance, why weren't they willing to fight for it? Do they honestly think and expect people are just gonna lay down for this nonsense much longer?"
"Have they rescheduled it? 

I mean, I myself am trans and no one in any of the many communities I belong to are talking about any ""Trans days of Vengeance"". 

We did just have the Trans Day Of Visibility, which was yesterday and wasn't canceled. 

I wonder if someone got the TDOV acronym confused."
"I don't think the 7:45 PM EST time tweet* on March 31 was about March 31st. That.. that would be a silly time to start talking about a Trans-Day of Visibility

Not to mention the actual message which is that if you think you were born in the wrong body, it's because God screwed up"
"Wait a minute, let's look at this from another perspective. Because it's better to be a big tent right now. The fact is, there are going to be lots of former ""liberals"" that find themselves in this position, and if that's because they haven't shifted in the political winds, then those are the kind of people we should welcome. Things have moved way too far auth left for a lot of regular people these days, and we should take the allies in as an example. Respect individualism where we see it, you know?"
"Considering your second paragraph, why are you of the opinion that jk rowling is left wing? She's been very outspoken on her opinion of gender reasignment and trans people"
"That's funny you use ""red pill"" as a term for people changing their sides, as the matrix is actually an allegory of the trans experience. üòÖ"
Good romcom premise tbh
When was there an insurrection of your federal capital building?
"Ok, but then why so much coverage of Jan 6?"
"Except it's not being treated as equal. Just look at the responses to my post. Other team, bad."
And he did it without the f-15s and flamethrowers Biden keeps saying you‚Äôd need
This is sarcasm I hope? Can‚Äôt tell anymore lol

Facts are not part of this discussion
It‚Äôs probably a fringe radical leftist group co-opting the trans day of visibility
"The og post was at 6:45am

And I think he was saying ""you were made in the image of god this way"" not that God messed up."
"From what I recall she has always been liberal but she has common sense and she uses her brain. Transgender movement radicals and the brainwashed go along to get along crowd would have you believe she is hateful and discriminatory, she is actually very compassionate but she also believes in basic biology. 

https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/jk-rowling-trans-rights-controversy-timeline-b2285947.html"
"Before the whole trans stuff, she was still a radical feminist. Pro-abortion, wage gap myth, and other feminist falsehoods and misbeliefs. She even retconned several of her Harry Potter characters as gay or lesbian because brownie points"
"This is part of the issue with the ‚Äúteams‚Äù. Life is not black and white, nor is politics.

Plenty of left leaning folks I know do not support the trans movement when children and sports are involved.

Just like I know plenty of right leaning folks that don‚Äôt give a shit if an adult is trans. 

One political view does not automatically make someone right or left winged politically."
"Honestly, if I could convince the FBI through my cooking to be non-partisan, unabashedly neutral, then I would cook them all steaks till the cows come home."
Daily Wire's newest film
"There wasn‚Äôt. The Feds and Antifa staged one on Jan 6th 2021, which was then maliciously attributed to Trump supporters and used as a political weapon to bludgeon them with."
"It's definitely not treated as equal.  Non-violent protestors who walked into a building with doors held open by capital police are *still* locked up and were held without trial for over a year.

Many of them did not deserve that treatment, and no one should be held that long without trial."
The corporatist media and intelligence community carries water for leftist protests because they have the same goal of a larger state. If January 6th were carried out by the left it would be called a mostly peaceful occupy movement and the FBI wouldn't have held anybody beyond a week.

"So your source is the Daily Mail?

Edit:

Down votes for asking a question?"
It was planned for Sunday
"Can't really do the ""image of god this way"" thing if you claim to be Catholic. There would be a God. And other people's interpretations"
"*Some* were non-violent, but criminal trespass is still a crime. I will agree that the justice system moves very slowly, which sucks even more for those who shouldn't be there"
Haha :)
"You're passive aggressively dismissing the source because it's a site that won't support your views.

You should've just responded with ""Unless CNN says it I won't believe it"""
It‚Äôs just one of many sources Andy Ngo uses
"Regardless it seems to be a play on the day with the exact same acronym, and I doubt a majority of trans advocates are even aware of it."
Why is it a crime to walk into a building your taxes pay for?
"I don't care if the site supports my views. 

I'm more curious about if a sensationalist tabloid is considered a valid news source?"
Then Google it and see if it's reported elsewhere. It isn't that hard to use your brain.
"Sorry but I'm a bit skeptical on this.  I still don't see any chance Trump is back in the White House.  And say he does get back in.  What changes from last time?  If Dems get House control again, nothing gets done but impeachment hearings.  There will be constant leaks to the press, valid or invalid.  Every day the press will behave just as they did before, everything will be a scandal again.  And his hirings.  Who's going to work for him and who can he trust?"
"Question:  If he wins the primary, will you vote Biden or Trump?"
And the same will happen with ANY Republican in the White House.
">If Dems get House control again, nothing gets done but impeachment hearings. There will be constant leaks to the press, valid or invalid. Every day the press will behave just as they did before, everything will be a scandal again.

You say that like it wouldn't be true of any other republican president. 

# But it will."
Trump of course but cant say i'd be hopeful of the next four years.  Only because we all know how it'll play out.
To a degree.  I think some will be far better at handling it than Trump was.  Much better. And far better hires too
"My impression of 45 is that he is very smart.  If he is elected, he does not have to worry of being reelected and he will clean house, irrespective what the media, dems and the RINOs will say.

Jim Caviezel should be number 1.  The best actor and person ever
I guess he didn't want to wait for his life to be over.
"Not Christian, but family values are something that all religions support and so should all people whether religious or not. Chris Pratt is probably my favorite actor for not bending over backwards to the woke Hollywood mob."

"Uh, O‚Äôdonnell was in the Kinsey movie."
"Don't know about the others, but Jon Voigt is absolutely a Christian."
And Mel Gibson.  As long as he stays away from booze lol.  He's dynamite in every small role I've seen him in recently.
Also James Woods.
"Figured Eastwood, but I'm truly happy to see Russel and Vaughn. I love those guys movies. Tombstone is such an awesome movie."
"Agreed.  Caviezel should be #1 just for his work & suffering in the titular role of ""Passion of the Christ"", wherein he was struck by lightning and scourged -- albeit accidentally, when the actor playing a Roman soldier accidentally missed the post placed behind Caviezel, striking the actor himself & taking a large hunk of flesh off his back.

Very charismatic.  Enjoyable even in secular themes, such as ""Person of Interest"" or ""Outlander""."
He wants to know right now what will it be üòÅ
"Lol, who put your Bible together?"
"Friend, Catholics indeed have many faults, and many practices that do not align with scripture, but your everyday Catholic believes in and loves Jesus.

Regardless of the man-made traditions they sometimes abide by, as long as they believe that Christ is the savior and was raised from the dead, they will get into Heaven."
"Ah yes, let‚Äôs be divisive on an otherwise uniting post. I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre a Baptist?"
Not only did we read the Bible but all of the translations you read were either translated by Catholics or based on translations by Catholics
"Did pastor Jim at the second metho-baptist harvest church of Waco, LLC tell you that last week?"
I believe Grammer is as well.

"There is only ONE Jesus.

Make no mistake, there will be Mormons in heaven, but they are terribly misguided and especially the ""leaders"" of that particular sect."
"Need to clarify this.  I was hasty in my reply, and for some reason my brain was stuck on Methodist...even tho I wrote Mormon.

Methodist, especially many of their ""leaders"" ARE incredibly misguided (trans preachers, etc).  But mormons are dead wrong in their beliefs.

Holding fast to the false teachings of their false prophets, I do not believe they will enter into the kingdom.  I dont think jehovas witnesses will either.

Sry for the confusion there."
Funny how the ‚Äúparty of science‚Äù refuses to accept the science.  The only ‚Äúscience‚Äù they follow is political
"Remember, threats against a conservative are no big deal. 

Threats against a liberal bring the FBI to your door."
Wow. Threatening her with violence because she‚Äôs right. Never try to use gender logic on a Democrat. It triggers them almost as badly as a MAGA hat!
We‚Äôre living in dark times.
"The worst thing about the left is that they don't condemn this kind of stuff.

They act like they're peaceful and non-voilent but will NEVER condemn behavior like this."
"Gender Identity =/= Gender. The former was invented by leftist academics in the middle of the 20th century. Once people start to understand that, this whole subject goes away. That's why ""Gender Identity"" has such things as ""Feykind"" and the like. 

Gender Identity is like Social Justice. As in the word they are modifying is made absolutely irrelevant to what they are creating. Social Justice is the opposite of Justice, it has no relevance to it. Gender Identity is in a similar boat.

The left has been misusing and manipulating language for decades. This is how they get people confused enough to go along with their bad ideas. Linguists won't correct them, even though they are intentionally misusing language. The reason being is that they think language naturally evolves (which it does). But what the left has been doing it prescriptive astroturf language changes in order to manipulate public opinion into support their radical beliefs.

Gender Identities are stereotypes of certain identities, acting as a pseudo personality. We used to call this insulting. We still do. It's group think, as they get to force people to ""act"" a certain way based on said identity."
"It's always the left overtly expressing violent thoughts to opposing viewpoints. 

We are at a point of irreconcilable differences in our country's history. It is impossible to coexist with a group of people who want you dead for not sharing their views."
Ladies and gentlemen...the ideology of tolerance!!!
"The woke leftist crowd wants tolerance ONLY when its to their ideals, outside of that they want to murder you"
Yik Yak is still a thing?
It's possible but very difficult. Technically pregnancies outside of the uterus are possible. It would require surgery to implant the embro onto the intestine. Then it would require another surgery to give birth. And there is a good chance the fetus and father would die. But hey we can Dr Marro this if you want to try.
And the party of diversity  refuses to tolerate diversity.
They‚Äôve always been that way. They claimed to be the free speech party until that could backfire on them.
"The Unabomber manifesto resonates more today than it did in 1995. It speaks to exactly this, and pretty much everything else we are seeing from the left today. If I didn't know different, it's almost as if the left took the Unabomber's words and committed to being the subject of everything he spoke of. 

Obviously, the dude pushed over the edge, but he probably had a saner view of reality than most anyone else. 

Highly recommend reading it. Scary how accurate it is."
Because the ultimate goal is to destroy the country
Linguists like Noam Chomsky are consciously manipulating language.
"I thought you meant invirto birth at first when you said outside the uterus‚Ä¶

I‚Äôd rather people not Frankenstein a person and child just to find out if we can have men give birth when everybody knows already they can‚Äôt and even if possible shouldn‚Äôt.

If you‚Äôre being sarcastic my bad I couldn‚Äôt tell üòÇ"
No it's actually not possible.
"Guessing you‚Äôre a man, and no real experience with obstetrics. What you‚Äôre talking about is an ectopic pregnancy which is dangerous to both mother & child. There‚Äôs a reason those pregnancies are always classified as life threatening and terminated. 

First, your GI tract can rupture, leading to massive hemorrhaging. The placenta plays a huge role, and if it becomes adhered to any of the other organs it‚Äôs life threatening. Normally a uterus expels the placenta; if left in the body it can lead to sepsis; and if you remove it when it‚Äôs adhered to other organs it normally causes severe blood loss. If attached to the intestines it can also cause bowel blockage. 

Babies of ectopic pregnancies are often deformed due to a lack of the uterine walls & being compressed in ways it should not be by the other organs. 

More than just implantation is necessary. You also need just the right balance of estrogen & progesterone to carry a pregnancy to term. 

There‚Äôs a reason those with XY chromosomes are not designed to have babies."
Diversity means that you believe everything that I do or else!
"Diversity of superficial things only, like skin color."
‚ÄúDiversity‚Äù only means less white men in any scenario
Is Chomsky even alive?
I'm just saying there are cases where a woman carried a child to birth that wasn't in her womb. Technically there isn't a reason a man couldn't do the same. It just couldn't happen naturally. Ectopic pregnancies are more common on the ovaries and you always need to be removed. The intestine is the only  place really large enough and with enough blood flow the fetus can survive.
Are you saying a man doesn't have an intestine like a woman?
*Unless you're Asian.
"Some rare cases sure but doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs good for the baby or person or that it should be promoted.

We‚Äôre turning human beings into guinea pigs, we already live in some kinda cyberpunk dystopia why make it worse and remove humanity further from its natural proven to be healthy route."
They sure don't have placentas and umbilical cords. How can people truly believe this crap? Why am I even entertaining this? I give up.
Depends on whichever is more convenient for them. They will happily count Asian students as part of their diversity profile and class percentages but then ignore them when pushing certain narratives
I agree but if we are going to make statements on science and fact we should be correct. Especially when the other side isn't being correct.
"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5727660/#:~:text=An%20abdominal%20pregnancy%20is%20an,and%20into%20the%20large%20intestine.

Very rare but possible."
"Agreed! I‚Äôm just saying even when it‚Äôs possible it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs the right thing to do or that it‚Äôs natural and without side effects.

Just my opinion tho obviously.

I actually didn‚Äôt know what you said was possible so thank you for giving me that info! gonna look more into it"
"When learning about ectopic pregnancies' that have been carried to term outside of the uterus someone always asks, could a man do it? It's always one of those debated hypotheticals. It would need a lot of direct medical intervention to make it happen and none of it would be even close to ethical. But yet people always wonder about it. Its only natural. I mean you hear one of the defining parts of a woman isn't technically required to fulfill one of the major functions of being a woman so you its just logical to speculate. I see a I'm getting  ton of downvotes I guess people don't like to speculate about medical procedures. Thanks for being reasonable."

"People complaining about Capitalism being bad don't have a clue how the government meddles with the free market, and is responsible for this mess."
That's not very bright.
"kind of surprised an exec branch decision can close down an industry. without any action or approval of congress. 

No law was mentioned, just a rule."
"So now I can‚Äôt choose my own lightbulbs, I can‚Äôt have a gas stove, and I have to own an EV.

Just put us all in a government built and controlled living space already, that‚Äôs clearly what we‚Äôre heading towards."
Years ago I had a coworker who had started missing work due to headaches. Remember reading the instructions for my chronograph which stated I can't use a florescent bulb due to a high speed flicker (which messes with the  device).  Suggested he change out his CFL bulbs at home with incandescent bulbs. He headaches went away.  Guessing the high speed flicker was picked up by the brain even though it is too fast to see?
Since when are normal light bulbs some environmental threat? Also are they really this bored in DC that they banning normal light bulbs? LEDs are nice enough but there's no reason to limit the market to just them.
You‚Äôd think that Democrats lust for regulation would regulate the amount of time one can serve in congress!  They regulate everything but themselves.  Term limits would be a perfect use of their regulatory power!
"Don't we have a few more pressing concerns, both at home and abroad?"
"Biden says tough luck to the significant number of Americans who get debilitating headaches from flickering LED lights. 

Such restrictions are anti-American and severely hurt those with disabilities."
Feel bad for the reptiles and baby chicks who rely on incandescent bulbs to stay alive.
"Only light bulb banned is her brain 
If she had half of one she‚Äôd be dangerous"
Our Utopia is here baby. Kick your feet up grab a cocktail and enjoy your perfect life provided by the govt. All with the added bonus of feeling good about saving the earth.
"> According to the DOE announcement, the regulations will save consumers an estimated $3 billion per year on utility bills and cut carbon emissions by 222 million metric tons over the next three decades.

... That's after spending $5 billion on new Chinese-manufactured LED lamps they last half as long as advertised.

#WHAT A DEAL! üí∞üí∞üí∞"
I work in stage/event lighting. Incandescent fixtures are how many low budget venues have survived. Forcing them to convert to LEDs will crash many community theatres and event spaces.
"What utter bullshit. Didn‚Äôt we go through this under Obama and get it repealed once already?

I love LED bulbs, but good quality ones are expensive. The cheap ones you can find are trash. Let people choose their own damn bulbs."
"What did liberals use for light before candles?

Electricity.

They will want to ban that next."
"And another industry is exported to mexico/china so people can bypass the law and buy them online. 

Yay government!"
LED light bulbs are fine but they're still not applicable for every application for example inside an oven or a grill light. Granholm is just another one who failed all the way to the top.
"You‚Äôll be cold, poor, in the dark, owning nothing, eating bugs‚Ä¶ And you‚Äôll like it!"
"There are a lot of good reasons to switch to LED bulbs, which is why the government should not be mandating it.

Ironically, the most commonly cited reason, energy efficiency, is only situationally a benefit. The energy efficiency of LED bulbs is a benefit if you live in a warm environment. But in a cold environment the waste heat of an incandescent bulb just heats the house instead, so it's not actually a waste.

The biggest benefit is actually their longer lifespan, if you buy a good quality LED. Unfortunately there are a lot of crap LEDs on the market that die long before they should due to faulty electronics, which will probably only increase due to legislation like this."
"The energy savings with LEDs is unreal though. Switched out the bulbs at my business 6 years ago, and it dropped the electric bill by $500 a month. 

That being said, I don't see why the government needs to mandate anything on this. The big box stores seem to carry less and less incandescent products each year. 

Furthermore, the cost of an LED bulb has dropped significantly over the past 5 years. You can grab a 4 pack for $6. 

I think the market was going to take us in this direction anyway."
"It's like the fact that Biden and his associates are ineffective leaders so they compensate by dictating other people's behavior. *You don't respect me because I am weak, now you cannot do this thing because I say so!*"
"Can't see the article. What are we banning now? The twisty ones? The LED ones?

We couldn't have the normal ones anymore and they promised the twisty ones would last longer and even though they were more expensive, we'd be saving money in the long run. They don't last any longer than the old fashioned ones and then the utility company raised our rates because people weren't using as much electricity anymore. We pay more for nothing in return. 

So then LED bulbs. They promised they would last even longer than the twisty ones and even though they were more expensive, we'd be saving money in the long run. They still don't last any longer than the old fashioned ones did and the damn utility company raised their rates again because people are using even less electricity. We pay more for nothing in return. 

Oh I guess according to the libs we're saving some nebulous thing no science worth it's salt can actually point to much less prove we're saving. So we have less money but can feel better about ourselves or something. F them."
Obama de Javu.
Didn't Obama do this?
The goal is to make the USA look like North Korea at night.
Odd how it's like 90% industry and commerical that consumed the power and water and gas.

"I like how the solution to reduce power usage is to ban a device.

"I love how many of them think it's company greed as to why prices go up during inflation. The dinning Kroger effect is very strong.

It's not always the case though. Consider the use of CFCs in refrigerators as an exmaple. Without government intervention I'm not sure free market would have regulated itself and stopped the further damage to the ozone layer.

"I believe the law is the ""Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007"", signed by Bush.

It calls for stricter regulations in 2020, but those were delayed by Trump, but this action is implementing the law as intended."
"Congress has been delegating its responsibilities for a long time. Every three-letter-acronym department comes from a law they signed giving the executive branch more power. They could take it back at any time, but it's a lot easier (and better politically) to judge and criticize then to actually get stuff done."
Not really killing an industry. The same companies have also been making all the LED bulbs for years in anticipation of something like this.
No no no. You'll rent the EV and pay mileage tax on it

Extra-sensitive people can actually have seizures because of that. There's something about even the tiniest of flickers that can short circuit someone's brain.
I have autism and the difference is very pronounced. I need sunglasses with fluorescent bulbs.
I see it whenever I try to record slow-mo video indoors.
Normal light bulbs consume much more power than LEDs. Makes sense why they want to do it but absolutely abuse of power.
Yes but they aren‚Äôt worried about that. They‚Äôll just blame the GOP and trump.
"I mean - ignoring the headache bits (I seriously need to test that for myself) I make enclosures with incandescents _specifically_ as they are inefficient and put out lots of heat. Heat lamps are still a thing too.

For making certain dried meats you really just need a box with some holes and a small incandescent. The spices do the work of ensuring it doesn‚Äôt rot and the results are delicious!

So‚Ä¶ where do I get my 5w incandescent now? ‚ÄúRetailers‚Äù doesn‚Äôt say much but feels like a flat out across the board ban. They still have speciality uses‚Ä¶ I can understand trying to reduce their use today but this is so non-specific that I‚Äôm wondering if the bulbs used in places where the inefficiency is a desired trait will still be able to get a supply???"
"Europe had an exception for incandescent bulbs for things like that when the EU decided incandescent illumination was evilbad.

"shut down  the stages, and give everyone flicker induced headaches.

then let us fight about saving the enviornment while the rich keep stealing everything and lighting it nicely with stockpiles of incandescent and halogen bulbs."
"I‚Äôd never thought about the heat waste as it pertains to this issue but you are certainly correct. When I was a kid we used to put a lamp under the sink in sub zero temps to keep them from freezing, worked great.
Also have been very disappointed with the supposed lifetime of LED bulbs from big box stores."
"Oh my gosh, you‚Äôre absolutely right. I actually never thought of it that way. I live in Toronto where the heat is on to some degree maybe nine months out of the year. I was thinking of swapping out my bulbs for LEDs, but never found one that really looked right to me or dimmed properly. But now I don‚Äôt see why I need to. I still have tons of spare bulbs around too, I‚Äôll probably never use them all up before the end of my life.  not sure what‚Äôs going on in USA but they are still relatively easily attainable here."
"They are carrying less because the government has mandated it.  

Yes LED is bringing savings, but where do they stop?  We already know they are going after appliances as well.  Let the market shift in its own, not based on government mandates (which we know also include some ‚Äúconvenient‚Äù stock trades before they are made public)"
"Not to mention CFLs contain mercury which is bad for you when broken and bad for the environment if not properly disposed of. Oh and LEDs are also incredibly wasteful of precious metals used in the drivers inside them and harmful to the environment since they‚Äôre also all plastic and nobody recycles them. Oh and all those legacy bulbs for lamps or weird light fixtures, yeah they don‚Äôt make led replacements for those either, so you gotta throw them away since they‚Äôre now useless. Massachusetts has banned businesses from selling anymore incandescent bulbs to the point where the hardware store I used to work at barely had a selection of decent LED bulbs that people were willing to buy. It‚Äôs a zero sum game at this point."
"No Obama brought us the toilets that cant flush a turd, faucets that barely flow water and dishwashers that cant clean your dishes."

">""Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007

interesting. here is a pdf of it. Section 322 . glancing at it I see nothing that says they can prohibit general incandescent lightbulbs UNLESS they fail to meet a lumen per watt requirement 

However it is pretty mind numbing to read.

I don't think Bush in 2007 intended for people to be forced to purchase and only be able to use products that barely existed at the time and weren't widely adopted. If he's that clairvoyant then we need to make him president again but I think we all know he isn't

LEDs are even worse.  Fluorescent and CFL lights only vary in intensity.  LEDs flicker full on/full off with the a/c frequency.

"I'm pretty sure you're baiting me, but I'll just throw one big reason.   
Inflation. The devaluing of the currency due to inflation thanks to our government's wonderful financial responsibility...  Companies have to raise their prices to still make money. Companies HAVE to profit to stay afloat. Sure they are obligated to for their share holders, but no one wins if the company goes belly up. 

If the dollars value goes from 1$ to .90$ then everything has to adjust."

Legislation =/= rights. Legislation restricting people from owning or purchasing things is very different from an amendment giving people the RIGHT to own them.
They are also hideously expensive. But worth it.
You can buy high-CRI LED bulbs in comfortable color temperatures. Personally I prefer 4000K but 2700K is much warmer and widely available.
You can buy 27k ones that are even designed to look like they have old school incandescent elements.
The amendments in the Bill of Rights do not give people the rights.  They are a restriction on government from infringing on the rights.  The rights exist with or without government approval.  It is up to the people to defend them when the government fails to do so. (which history shows us all governments will do eventually)

"Hah, wait till we get the government as the sole owner of rentals. Just look up the movie Dr. Zhivago for a reference: you'll have 3 or 4 families to a unit, as it really was in the Soviet Union."
"I did bankruptcy work for a couple years.  Half our cases were landlords who owned a couple properties.  Their mortgages were fixed monthly expenses.  Their property tax valuations were the issue.  Most of the landlords had a thin margin between what they were covering for their fixed expenses and what they took in for rent.  Their wealth creation was from paying off the mortgage, not a monthly income stream.  When their monthly tax obligations went up by a couple hundred it was not possible to transfer the expense over.  When rents for your units are 550-600 a month (this was a couple decades ago), it's not possible to raise those rents over 800.  If it was, they would have been doing it already.

The idea there are a bunch of rich people who own properties and they can all afford to pass their wealth on because a tenant decides to quit their good paying job for something easier, or a tenant that went into credit card debt for new stuff is typical leftist bullshit. 

I'm sure there are rich landlords in the city, or Albany, or where ever.  I'm also sure there are tens of thousands of landlords who aren't rich and who are just getting by.  They put their life long saving into buy a couple homes to rent, or they put their mother-in-law property up for rent when she passed.  That's how the average guy gets ahead in life.  It's not by footing the bill for some loser who has shit priorities.  I guarantee you there are a lot of losers out there who could pay rent and they chose not to."

NY is fit to implode.
Squatter protection laws are already wreaking havoc in California. New York is always just one step behind its dystopian cousin to the west.
"Rent control is known to be bad economics. However it is usually politically successful because most people don't understand even basic economics.

When this was tried in Hong Kong, landlords would intentionally vandalize their properties late at night to make them unlivable, forcing the tenants out so they could demolish the building and sell it for commercial or industrial purposes where they could actually break even or turn a profit since rent control causes them to lose money.

In NYC, landlord arsons became so common that burned-out tenants were given special welfare allowances -- a government failure in reaction to a government failure, which incentivized the *tenants themselves* to commit arson.

I can see how you could get charged but ten years seems a bit excessive, should be a fine if anything. Also this was before Covid in 2016 so if you think you could just vote for someone without showing up in person or having an absentee ballot then you probably shouldn‚Äôt be able to vote for falling for a meme like that. 

The meme maker should‚Äôve put an automated text back explaining it was a meme and how to properly vote to cover himself. Not sure if he did that or not but definitely got to be careful now."

"Inclusive means giving everyone an equal start. Outcomes, though, are based on individual performance."
"It is crossing a line. The responsible people I know who have these issues have developed skills and methods for compensating for or mitigating the tendencies that come with their disability, at least when it comes to their livelihood. The people who don't just want to be a victim and given a hand out. 

I'm not saying have zero empathy for someone who has a disability like those and is clearly trying and makes a mistake, ya know, like everyone else, but equality means holding everyone to equal standards. Equity is a joke. Some people do have it harder than others and need to work a little more to reach society's (or business) acceptable standards but if anything that just makes those people that much stronger for having overcome what they have."

"Am neurodivergent.

Sometimes I don't act quite like normal people.  I'm not very friendly, I don't get jokes, I have a hard time with too much noise and disorganization.  But I think it's perfectly reasonable for an employer to expect me to show up on time, not cancel for no reason, and generally get my stuff done with a minimum of drama.  That's why they're paying me, after all.

Neurodivergence isn't my fault, but other people shouldn't be expected to manage it for me.  Some understanding, yes, but ultimately it's my responsibility."
"I agree with maybe two of these in very limited circumstances. Namely, last minute appointments and forgiving disorganization. The rest of it is total BS."
"I‚Äôve got severe ADD and most of this is nonsense.  I struggle with time management and organizational skills, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that I don‚Äôt work at them.  It‚Äôs one thing to be a few minutes late to work due to traffic or road work but poor timing is not really acceptable.  I set timers to remind myself of when I need to leave to get to work and have a fifteen minute leeway because I know I will get sidetracked with something else."
Why do posts from self appointed ‚Äúvictim class spokespeople‚Äù always start with ‚Äúfriendly reminder‚Äù followed by the equivalent of a hostage taker‚Äôs list of demands?
"I have crippling ADHD.  That's no one else's burden.  When people can't work with you because you're not doing your part, they are suffering for your expectation that accommodate you instead of you finding means of compensating for your troubles.  I have a phone with calenders and alarms, I'm not late for nothing."
"Offer flexibility. Forgive lateness. They do realize employers run a business right, not a fun house. If you being late or have to constantly miss work, you'll likely be fired, you're costing the business money. I feel bad for managers who have to put up with stuff like this."
"If you truly want to be inclusive, use plain English instead of wokespeech jargon."
"I have severe ADHD. This can cause me to be forgetful, easily distracted, and overstimulated.

It‚Äôs MY job to not only look for a job that accommodates those struggles, but to put in the extra effort in myself to try and overcome those struggles. It‚Äôs more work for me than others but it is my job. In school, sure I can get accommodations like extended due dates/test times or a note taker because I‚Äôm in an environment specifically made for learning. But when I am doing a job where other people specifically rely on me‚Äîwhen there are customers and coworkers who need my work to progress, that‚Äôs on me. It‚Äôs more work for me than someone without ADHD, but that‚Äôs my battle."
"I have autism and I find that offensive.

I struggle with keeping my emotions in check at work sometimes, but ignoring that, I can do everything asked of me at my job, and quite well. Do we have to work more than others? Yes, but the beauty of capitalism is if you're good at something and can monetize it and work at it, you will find a role and succeed. 

To me, making constant accommodations doesn't push those disadvantaged to better themselves and improve their lives. Instead, it just encourages them to wallow in being disadvantaged and bringing others down as a result."
"Anyone else tired of being told that you MUST accept things you may not wish to accept?  Yea, me too."
"I'm autistic, and there's a difference between giving me a seat at the table and letting me stand on it.  And I don't *need* you to let me stand on it.  This is why I find posts like these insulting: *Oh, he's autistic: he can't help it!  Just let the poor guy do whatever he does, and give him his paycheck.*

Things like being understanding when I don't understand sarcasm, letting me wear earplugs in loud environments (although I wouldn't choose a job like that in the first place), and just generally understanding why I'm kind of... Awkward sometimes are all great things.  

But when we're talking about behaviors like these that would actually hold my coworkers back...  I don't want charity.  If I'm holding a place back by working there, due to my autism or anything else, I don't want to work there.  

Reasonable accommodations are great, things that cost little to nothing and don't negatively impact coworkers or change the very nature of the position.  But these accommodations are *unreasonable.*"
"Well, how about if they understand my need to have workers show up and do the job with no drama. Acceptance should go both ways."
This is why I really hate the autism community despite being on the spectrum myself. They just want to reinforce and protect bad behaviors rather than trying to improve and have some semblance of normality
"As a manager, in have had employees on the spectrum and worked around it. They did a great job. One was a calibration technician who loved to be alone in his lab. One lady was borderline - we put her in a role as a reliability engineer and she did great, even if her emails to customers were a little too direct üòÇ

Yes, those traits would keep them out of management or other roles, but they did a good job and I was glad to have them"
"When I was in school there were some subjects I was great at, and a couple of others I wasn‚Äôt good at whatsoever. Guess what? I was expected to pass those hard (for me) classes just like the others. I arranged tutoring  for myself and spent twice as much time studying those courses as the others. 

Is that fair? Nope. But people have to be taught that some people and some things you do, require more work and input than others if you want to achieve a goal. 

Equality of opportunity, NOT outcomes."
"Democrats don't understand how hard it is to run a successful business. They think if you're a business owner, that you're loaded, and money just grows on trees for you. They seem to treat hiring employees as some sort of charity act where you can give everyone a million dollar salary with all kinds of benefits for working 3 hours per week. They don't seem to understand that you're hiring someone to do a job, so that they can try and make money for your own family. They don't understand how hard it is to find good employees to make your business run, and that making good hiring decisions can be the defining factor in whether or not you're able to keep your doors open and avoid bankruptcy.

So sure, they think that you can hire an employee who is always late, cancels last minute, has emotional outbursts to customers and in front of customers, and none of that is going to affect your bottom line. They don't understand the realities of running a business."
"Wrong. I am autistic, medically tested. The reason why I am where I am in my job, is because I DO NOT come late, I DO NOT have meltdowns, I DO NOT b1tch around, I AM NOT disorganised, except at home ;P. Never did, never had.  I work as COO in a company, and the only reason I'm not CEO, is that I refused it, because I don't like taking care of 200+ people.  That ""person"" in the tweet or whatever it is, uses neurodiversity to fit lazy, anti-social and immature people into a place where they don't belong. As a autist I feel discriminated by this clearly uninformed or lying troll."
"Lateness - sorry, no, there is no excuse for not learning to compensate

Last-Minute cancellations - again, sorry but no. If you cannot learn to cover for your responsibilities you have no business having responsibilities. 

Rejection-sensitive dysphoria - I had to look this up - it just means do not be an asshole to people and you should be fine. If someone cannot take constructive criticism given in a manner appropriate to the situation they shouldn't have responsibilities that may require their performance to be criticised. Ironic since so many of these people are creatives who will deal with this for the entirety of their careers.

Understand Emotional Dysregulation - This one is valid. I managed someone on the spectrum. Brilliant, but easily agitated. This one employee made me a much better manager because I had to learn to approach them different. As a manager it was my job to get the best performance from everyone while maintaining a healthy work environment. I learned to pay attention to how this person responded to things and I changed my behavior enough to minimize this employees reactions to anything that might set them off. Mind you this person was actually on the spectrum, not just a sensitive person looking for excuses to be difficult. It took almost no effort once I figured it out and was more than worth the time figuring it out. 

Flexibility - this one is too open ended to respond. Some flexibility is always needed with every employee. 

Intensity - Again too open ended - if someone is aggressive and making the workplace feel on edge then sorry, no. If someone is excited and contributing positively to the goals then sure, I will be more than happy to help that person learn to temper their excitement in order to be a better communicator. 

Forgive disorganization - once more too open ended. Is your desk a little unorganized or are you missing goals and deadlines and affecting other teams from getting their jobs done. 

And finally, if any of these put others safety at risk it is a flat out no, you should not be doing that job."
I literally got fired from my last job because I refused to tolerate this BS.
"I‚Äôm a DOD Contractor with Combat PTSD and ADHD. When my symptoms kick in, I tell my agency and they are very sympathetic. Most companies will work with you if you communicate but to just expect them to be accepting or last minute cancellations or lateness.

"What this person is asking for is wrong.  I‚Äôm autistic too but I‚Äôd never force this kind of thinking on anyone, especially the ‚Äúforgive lateness‚Äù crap."
No.  Full stop.  Get out.
I‚Äôve seen and heard too many people use various excuses for their office behavior when in fact the problem was that they were effort divergent.

You wanna be a charity case? Go work for a non-profit. They probably won't have time for your BS either"
"This is just equality of outcome in different words. It just a way of saying no one should ever be judged to the same standard. This just lowers the standard for some but that has real world problems.

"My son (38) is neurodivergent and has been hospitalized and had run ins with the law many times since he was 17 he tried many different therapists, psychiatrists and drugs to control his mental health. About 7 years ago he finally found the right psychiatrist who properly diagnosed him and prescribed him the right medications for his condition. He now has a 2 year college degree owns his own house and has 3 year round jobs plus 1 seasonal one for about 15 weeks during the summer. He‚Äôs the hardest working guy I know and the employee his bosses all call when they need someone to count on to get the job done right. He never complains about anything and if he doesn‚Äôt know how to do something complicated that‚Äôs asked of him he says so an expert can be called in. Everyone‚Äôs different I know, but he‚Äôs never been late, used a sick day or otherwise let his mental health condition dictate his life or work even though his employers know about his issues and would gladly accommodate any reasonable request he made. The kid‚Äôs a total stud and my biggest hero. Neurodivergent people can make awesome contributions to our society."
"No joke, a woman that used to work for my company claimed this, and all of the sudden she became untouchable. Late, call offs, not doing her job etc.. so she was assigned no work and basically unlimited time off. The plan worked and she got bored enough and left. When she applied to come back, we filled it with somebody else."

However if you are the latter, *nothing* you do is OK."
"That's B.S.!! You cannot say that you're always late, because that's how you are, like it's a disability. But with the direction the U.S. going right now it wouldn't surprise me one bit if someone sued over this and actually won. 

Here's some options, to name a few:

1. Get on medicine and/or counseling.
2. Find a job where you can have a flexible schedule out of the house or at home, one that pays you for what you get done, no salary. That might be an incentive. 
3. If those don't work, try getting on disability. But that probably won't happen unless your doctor renders you untreatable or unable to work due to mental issues. I'm sure there are cases like that, and I'm not against it if a doctor honestly says there's no other options. I've personally known a few people that have misused disability, or got a doctor that would take their word for it without any other proof. That is WRONG, and I don't condone that at all."

Well that being said would there need to be work accommodations?  During my employment interview the on duty hours were clear and the question asked if that would work for you.  Aside from the unusual event/emergency we would roll with it.  But if it became routine it was a major problem because we would be scrambling to care for patients who we needed to provide care for in an efficient manner.
You would have to be very autistic to think that this was acceptable.

"What ever happened to treat others the way you want them to treat you?  Be kind and understanding, but hold people to the standards you'd hold for anyone else regardless of anything else.  Accommodations can, and should, be made for people with disabilities, but how does that apply to being late?

"I just managed a neuro-divergent person out of my organization as she was a very poor fit.  Yes, she had brilliant ideas but could never stay on topic and got bored very quickly and constantly switched projects. Some days she was inspiring and energetic, other times she was morose and dragged the whole team into a deep funk. She was initially the source of energy to the organization but quickly became exhausting as it was the wild ride stream of consciousness in every meeting.  Am sure there are creative roles where this type of behavior would be extremely helpful but in a mid-size aerospace project team it was absolutely chaotic."
This is great and I'm loving it. My kids are going to be very successful if they adopt even half the shit I teach them in a world full of fucking losers like the individuals who write and believe in this garbage.
How about the neurodivergence t give themselves more time to do shit because it takes them longer. Everyone has some kind of issue. Figure out what you have to do to be successful despite what makes it difficult for you!  WTH?!

I expect at least twice the pay of someone like this. It would never happen though.
if you're autistic and have ADHD and refuse to work on yourself like anyone else it doesn't excuse you being a totally useless human being. i know plenty of people who suffer from one or both of these and think much better of themselves than this. honestly this line of thinking is insulting.
"Neuro divergence is just a fancy made up word to say ""unique"" and I hate it.

I do think that forgiveness and help should be awarded to people who's brains particularly work in certain ways, but that doesn't mean a free pass should be given. If someone is consistently late and you need them to be on time, tell them and help them build a strategy to meet the goal. Let them know there will be consequences and follow through with the consequences if goals aren't met. If needed fire them, but give them a chance to improve first.

I was diagnosed with ADHD as a child and believe the diagnosis is pretty accurate, but I agree with Dr. Peterson that ADHD may be a made up illness due to the fact that we don't completely understand temperament. It's not like I'm incapable of doing things, it's more than my brain is hardwired to work in certain ways. Some of these ways I have leveraged to make myself more efficient (I can learn things really fast) but other ways it's a disadvantage (I can't ever show up to work on time in the morning).

Luckily my job doesn't require me to be on time. I found a place for me, and I'm sure everyone else can too. Just stop babying people."
"Don‚Äôt forget:

-Accept laziness 
-Understand inaccuracy

"There's some levels where people are ridiculous about these things though, ex being late. 

I got written up for being late to work because there was a newsworthy accident on the freeway with 5 cars. When I heard about it on the radio I immediately emailed my team telling them I was stuck behind the major accident and to avoid the highway. 

I ended up being 35minutes late and was able to get two of my coworkers who take the same way to work off the road and onto alternative routes so they could be on time. I walked in and immediately was pulled into a room for a ""performance notification,"" such a giant waste of time. 

This was all while working at an escalated tech support job where we work off a ticketing queue, we didn't even answer phones directly to deal with customers."

"People forget why companies hire employees.  They need to get stuff done.  If you can't get stuff done, they should hire someone else.  

Coordinating action with other people happens by making and keeping promises. I understand this can be harder for some than others but it doesn't mean it is optional."
Is this meant to be about a work environment? It all makes more sense to me if we‚Äôre talking about friends instead of employees
"‚Ä¶did they essentially just define themselves as being unreliable, sensitive, unorganized, special cases with poor time management? Is that ‚Äúwho they are‚Äù?? Lol I bet there are just so many employers lining up to hire them."
This isn't the same ballpark but it reminds me of the Kanye defenders using his bipolar condition for his love of Hitler.
"This is already happening in our public schools. I have been a substitute teacher for 10 different districts since 2018. Mentally handicapped students have been integrated into regular classrooms. They sometimes, but not always, have assistants.

If a child is autistic, even at the high school level, he or she is allowed to act out with impunity. They are often hateful towards students, staff and teachers ‚Äì with zero consequences. At the elementary level, they routinely physically attack teachers and students with no consequences. Recently, a 6ft+  mentally impaired high school student in Florida nearly beat a staff member to death when she confiscated his Nintendo Switch."
Can‚Äôt we just treat them like normal and let natural selection do the heavy lifting?
"Oh.

No thank you."
">rejection-sensitive dysphoria 

I hate this timeline."
"In the US, we have the ADA to help protect neurodivergent individuals. I‚Äôve hired several people with Autism. They tell me up front what their difficulties are, ask me for a specific accommodation and we lay it down in writing what their expectations are. Can‚Äôt make it at 8:30 because of your Autism? That‚Äôs fine, I set up that they get a pass to come in at 9:30. Come in at 9:36? Late and it follows the same consequences as the other staff. The key with ADA is that the person needing the accommodation has to request it, be specific with their needs, and it has to be reasonable and not cause undo difficulty for the employer, but most importantly they still need to be able to accomplish the job they are being paid for."
"This is what they've been saying for years now, every time they tout equity. This is just saying that quiet part out loud finally."
I struggle with some of these things and I think this is utter ridiculousness. You have to form better habits and find ways to adjust for your weaknesses. These people expect the entire world to bubble proof itself and cater specifically to them. It‚Äôs narcissistic.
"I honestly can‚Äôt believe that this stuff is reality. It defies all common sense, logic and intelligence. On top of that, we have it shoved down our throats, told to accept it and then get attacked, ridiculed and told we have a phobia if we don‚Äôt agree with it 100%.  I cannot believe this is real life."
As a dyslexic I call BS on this. I try my best not to on my dyslexia affect my life or my work. The only time people know that I'm dyslexic is when I get caught making a mistake caused by my dyslexia. I do not ask for special treatment. I only ask for understanding.
"I gotta disagree with most as I feel strongly people with mental illnesses should be accommodated for as much as fiscally logical. I do agree tho that for many, their job should be what their abilities allow which often means menial and low paying jobs."
"I think the problem is they've twisted the definition of acceptance. From what I understand, you can accept something without necessarily agreeing or liking it, hence ""accepting death"" as an example. You can accept that a friend likes anime, even if you don't like it as another example. It's a willingness to tolerate.

What these people are asking for isn't acceptance, it's compliance. Hence, it's not enough to tolerate trans, you must also make concessions to them. Those are two entirely different concepts, and it isn't surprising the left is trying to twist language."
"What does it all matter? Either you can perform certain tasks efficiently and on time or you can't. If you can't, find another profession."
"eh, if we fire Autistic people for having the traits of an autistic person we just end up with a bunch of unemployed autistic people clogging up the system."
If someone at work said they were suffering from rejection sensitive dysphoria I would do everything in my power not to interact with them ever again.
"I think it means like, as friends."
"I have ADHD and this is not acceptable the rest of the world does not need to change for a small minority of people. Those people pushing this crap need to learn life dealt them a bad hand and life doesn't conform to you, you conform to life, it is much bigger than them."
"Most of us, in fact, most of the world, is happy just to have a seat at the table.  An unjustified expectation of more than that is an insult to those who fought for decades, if not centuries, just to establish a level playing field."
I have found those who demand acceptance are usually the least tolerant of anyone who struggles with their demands.
"Having ADHD and having a son who has dealt with low level autism, this is utter garbage.  Things like punctuality, keeping your appointments, and dealing with rejection are basic skills that you should be taught *regardless* of your mental capacity.  These are the lowest level of basic standards, and if you can't meet them, you don't belong in basic work settings: you belong in a nursing home.

Being at work means you are providing value to your employer: you are not entitled to income you did not earn and you are not entitled to encroach on other people's productivity.  If you are a hindrance to a company's productivity and profitability, you should be cut loose, end of story."
"I mean, while some of these are a bit over the top. Yes, you are expected to do that. It's called a disability for a reason. Be grateful you don't have to deal with a permanent neurological condition that makes existing in society extremely difficult. 
Some better accommodations include 
Written instructions over verbal instructions 
Ability to wear noise canceling headphones (if possible) 
Alternative lighting for personal office (if applicable) 
Just a few things that can make a huge difference for a autistic person."
"This is the same as fat acceptance. These movements all boil down to "" I don't want to have to be responsible for my actions"" . The entire progressive political stance rests on this idea."

**No.**
"I am regularly 3-8 minutes late at my workplace... but I also rebuilt my department from the ground, fix everyone's problems, and keep my department productive. I also regularly work overtime to ensure the next shift can run smoothly (because they have smooth brains and screw stuff up constantly). As such, my boss never talks about my tardiness. Work hard and make yourself worth the trouble, and people tend to overlook the little things."
"You have to do that with everyone then, not just the folks with the tism. 

And as soon as you start allowing this, work will be chaos with people constantly calling in or being late.

I had a boss that was kind and understanding, wouldn't bat an eye if you were late or couldn't come in as long as the reasons were good. 

His people walked all over him."
"If you can‚Äôt meet the performance expectations of a job, you should look for a job that is a better fit. Certain accommodations can be helpful for neurodivergent people, but even the Americans with Disabilities Act doesn‚Äôt protect those who need accommodations that cause undue burden to their employers."
"This is laughable bullshit. If you can‚Äôt fulfill the requirements of the job, you shouldn‚Äôt have the job."
Never hire these people
"If you're chronically late, cancel things at the last minute (screwing everyone else who can manage to not do this), can't accept important criticism, can't control your emotions in a professional environment.... what exactly will you be doing that brings my customers value that couldn't be brought by someone without all these issues?

Honestly, if I have a big company and I need to hire people like this I can totally live with that (so long as it's not too many): I'll just pay them to stay home and not touch anything in my company."
yeah fuck that - do your job or get replaced.

Emotional dysregulation may be something that applies to him one day as well‚Ä¶ sometimes he misses social cues and this can cause him confusion.

This is about as ridiculous as a demand I've ever read.
"Acceptance is earned, not deserved."
"One thing bosses need most is reliability.  If people can just turn up late or never whenever they feel like it then the boss needs to let them go.

No your not wrong. This people are communists who hate freedom in all of its forms. They are wolves pretending to protect sheep.
I‚Äôm neurodivegent now
"No one owes anyone acceptance no matter what their case might be, or how needless or ridiculous I might think it. Autism is no excuse either, hey it's fine, it happens, but autistic folks still have to function in the world, OR come up with a way of doing so that works for them.

This is not 'equality'. It's special treatment.

"Autistic and ADHD ""creator"" sounds like an a grade hustler"
"If that is what being inclusive means, I‚Äôm not gonna be inclusive. You get the same courtesy as everyone else. I‚Äôm not obligated to do more, nor should you expect me to."
All these diversity and inclusivity hires just result in drawn-out terminations and having to hire an old guy or gal six months later to clean up the mess.
"Nowhere in that tweet did I see ‚Äútake personal responsibility for your emotions and actions‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm just supposed to accept that you choose not to be on time? Come on.

I‚Äôm supposed normalize you getting your panties bunched because someone rejected you? No I don‚Äôt think so. 

Take some responsibility for yourself."
So now tardiness and poor organization are symptoms of disease rather than sloppy character development?  Such sad victims.
"The scariest part of this is when this stuff gets government protection. Your business or your school (because these ideas extend into education) has certain standards, those standards become illegal."
"As an autist, don't trust anyone that wears these labels like fashion statements. No true autist calls themselves nEuRoDiVeRgEnT. That's like thinking Spanish people call themselves LatinX. Nah, it's the same uppity, white liberals doing both.

Also, I'm a big procrastinator (Might be because of ADHD. Who knows? Who cares?), but show some pride and meet your deadlines. Be a goddamn professional!

>!Definitely forgive disorganization though, especially in their own spaces, and accept our passionate INTENSITY!!!!<"

I really feel like EVERYONE just needs to stfu for like 18 months.

"I'm neurodivergent. I don't expect or want exceptions. I will be late, I will get distracted, but I hold myself to a high standard and will always work to do better. Making excuses and exceptions for me doesn't help me do that and hurts everybody else."
"I have Asperger's and sometimes I do have a lot of these problems, I do ask that people give me a bit of a break on it because it's really difficult to manage, but it's not consistent or constant, and I make up for it bringing a product that's better than anything else someone does even with the problems I have"
"As someone who struggled to cross the finish line of grad school with undiagnosed ADHD and had my peace and self-esteem destroyed in the process, I struggle with the blanket statement but would like to offer a nuanced perspective.

We should absolutely hold people accountable for being late, last-minute cancellations, etc. but we should stop making moral judgments on these traits because neurodivergent people have a disability.
‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre late for your job once then you don‚Äôt care about it.‚Äù - No, I do really care about my job, but I struggle with perceiving time and so I sometimes am late. But once I show up I am 100% in and ready to work.
‚ÄúIf you cancel on me last-minute, you don‚Äôt care about me.‚Äù - I likely canceled last-minute because I was anxious and overwhelmed about something not related to you, and I needed time to compose myself.
‚ÄúYour desk is so unorganized, you‚Äôre a messy person and therefore unreliable.‚Äù - I‚Äôm someone who needs visual reminders to get stuff done and there‚Äôs a reason behind my piles.

Should these types of needs/feelings be communicated to team members and supervisors? Absolutely. But sometimes it‚Äôs exhausting to have to explain oneself all the time. We (hopefully) don‚Äôt expect someone in a wheelchair to constantly explain why they need X thing because of their motor disability, but the standards are still different for cognitive disabilities."
"Inclusiveness also means when you accept being included in an employment position with a business, there are things you MUST do to be included. To force everyone else to do your job is NOT inclusive. Why do they always think inclusiveness is a one way street where only THEIR needs should be accepted in order for inclusiveness to be satisfied. Refusing to include yourself in the requirements of the job is also NOT being inclusive."
How is an organization supposed to operate like that? Maybe that is what‚Äôs wrong with the US government these days?
No. Everyone will be held to the same standard. Work harder
You nave got to be KIDDING me. This can‚Äôt actually be real ?
"I had a boss who was always late, was flakey, could not regulate his emotions, would get really intense when challenged, and was disorganized. He was a white male in his 60s so everyone just called him an asshole.

Edit: I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm being downvoted. The point is this push for acceptance is entirely dependent on the type of person and not the behavior. The said boss above is an unprofessional jerk, but if he was a dif demographic I‚Äôd be expected to just accept it. How is this any different then the 1950s good ol boy club style?"
"Nope. Survival of the fittest. And if that comes back to bite me, so be it. I should have been more fit. Almost sounds like ""personal responsibility""."
WHAT IS HAPPENING TO OUR WORLD???

"I sleep about 3 hours per day, have my body ache with fibromyalgia pains, and a fibro fog that makes me forget what I'm doing. I can't feel my hands most days, and simple tasks are annoying. I'm an artists and my own hobbies make me feel worse.

YET, I've never been late to work, and I've never lost my temper at a coworker or employee. I've never quit a job without already having another lined up. My room and house are clean, I do all the cooking at home, I close the toilet seat.

This has nothing to do with how you think or feel, asking for special treatment is just a lack of diligence and ethics"
No
"I'm autistic, and quite honestly I hate the terms ""neurodivergent"" and ""neurotypical"". They sound like designations used to segregate people in some low quality sci fi dystopia book."
"I have no problem with these issues from people with autism.  I don't think anybody would. 

Its not very clear from this post that , that is what they are speaking too.

More self diagnosed twits.
"Sorry I cheated on you, honey. I'm neuro divergent."
"Is neurodivergent was stoners call themselves, now?"
A lack of work ethic.
"I was hoping this was on r/autism when I saw it.

What's wrong with providing for mentally disabled people like me? You wouldn't throw a hissy fit about installing handicap ramps and elevators in an office."
"I've never met anyone who actually suffers from neurodevelopment issues or emotional disturbances that uses this ridiculous made up cult jargon. Neurodevelopment issues and emotional disturbances are serious conditions and individuals who actually have them can suffer in profound ways. If those people need accomodations at work they make them ahead of time under the ADA. No serious person screws up at work and then to avoid accountability barfs out these terms to shame their co-workers. This phenomenon of self diagnosing autism, adhd and other related conditions (some of which are completely made up) seems to be very prevalent with millennials as some kind of social status points system, it is so bizarre."
"""Accept that I never acquired a single god damned skill because I spent every minute of every day trying to describe to my friends what *mood my genitals were in that day*"""

I will treat everybody the same. If I allow you to be late, I will have to allow everybody to be late. The same goes for every other ""trait"" listed.

It is up to me, the business owner, to see that my business succeeds. Allowing behaviors that negatively impact the work flow and culture I have so painstakingly created will not fly with me."
"ADHD is a disability. You are required to make exceptions for other disabilities. Like people who have mental or physical disabilites, you have to accept they may not move fast at what they are doing. It should be the same for ADHD."

What an ignorant bigot"
You will suck the woman's dick. Bigot.
"People responding here are so insensitive and uncaring. The picture doesn't even go far enough. For example, being late doesn't require forgiveness because there is nothing wrong with it most of the time.

When I was at my best, most efficient, most professional, I was very often late to work by at least 20 to 30 minutes, occasionally by hours. Since the time really does not matter for my kind of work, there was next to zero reason for anyone to care. The people who cared and complained were often incompetent unprofessional nits.

Don't forgive lateness, just stop thinking of it as a problem in the first place unless a line of business work would stop because of it."
Kinda like accepting right wing states doing the whole child marriage thing or religion molesting kids?
"If an employee depended on a wheelchair or other mobility assisting device, or had a TBI, would you expect them to have the exact same experiences in life and ease as someone who had no injuries and had full control of their body and voluntary movement?

Just because you cannot see ADHD and Autism, that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not disability or effects a person‚Äôs ability. 

Additionally, don‚Äôt you want people to have a job and work or would you prefer that they we‚Äôre dependent on state and federal financial resources?"
Don‚Äôt know why this shitheap of a sub appeared on my feed. Ban me please so I can save my eyesight from you absolute clowns.
Fuck all of that.  Be a fucking adult and take responsibility for your own shit.
"I understand that there has to be a separate set of rules in dealing with an autistic individual... I support that... Having said that, autism does not qualify you for most jobs and can disqualify from others. No way in hell I'm babysitting ANYONE 6 floors off the ground on a controlled deck, or watch them run around in a 30' circle while tethered to a retractable lanyard. So this sounds like retail / fast food problems to me... And they deal with these types of demands every day, from regular ordinary no spectrum individuals."
"So now they just want excuses to be agents of chaos in a field which requires order to function successfully and effectively.

No.

Being on time isn't whiteness. Being reliable isn't intolerance. I'm sick of the left trying to force us to accept laziness and incompetence because they have stupid excuses."

Yes-I'm an Aspie.

I'm also a responsible adult.

If I fuck-up, my Asperger's doesn't give a pass from owing up to that.

I fought hard to EARN  the right to be treated as an equal at the table-rather than forever be treated as 'special needs'."
"As someone with ADHD, I see what she‚Äôs trying to say here. It is extremely frustrating trying to compete in a world where you have the most basic tasks working against you. I would not wish ADHD upon anyone. Time blindness especially is a big one.

That being said, the responsibility is still on ME to live my best life and make the best decisions that I can. I can‚Äôt expect the rest of the world to cater to me and how my brain works. Absolutely you can come across people who understand you and get how you work‚Ä¶but sometimes you won‚Äôt. And that‚Äôs ok. It‚Äôs on YOU to navigate these challenges and become the best version of yourself that you can be.

I am an awesome leader in the work place. I make a great manager, I‚Äôm competent and the people below me respect me. But I am terrible at following other peoples directions‚Ä¶things just don‚Äôt stick when people tell me things. I forget what they said or I‚Äôll only hear parts of it. I‚Äôve been told all my life that I have ‚Äúno common sense‚Äù or I‚Äôm an idiot or whatever the case may be. I know these things aren‚Äôt true, and I do wish more people understood ADHD and how we are kind of all over the place and sometimes we have serious brain fog that we can‚Äôt seem to shake, but it doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre dumb or that we lack leadership skills or intellect. Everyone loves me as a manager because I have my own system and I get the job done. My whole life I‚Äôve been like ‚Äúif people would just give me a chance I can prove to them that I can do the job‚Äù, and then I get into a leadership position and everybody is eating their words. I really just can‚Äôt follow other peoples systems, I have a very hard time with that. As a leader, any time I‚Äôm training someone I get a feel for how they work and I keep open communication with them to see what aspects of the job suit them better or worse than others. It‚Äôs all about looking at the positives of each individual and seeing what they offer the team and working with that. If someone has a particular system or way of working that suits them better, then I let them do their thing, because that‚Äôs how they work best. For the most part I let them play to their strengths, but I do challenge them sometimes to put them outside their comfort zone a little.

So yeah, like I said, I get what she‚Äôs saying, I do admit that life really isn‚Äôt very fair to people with ADHD. We don‚Äôt even have the benefit of having a condition that people take seriously, so we just get called lazy, but at the end of the day, you are dealt the cards that you are dealt and you gotta do the best you can in life. You can‚Äôt adopt the mentality of ‚Äúeveryone must cater to me‚Äù, because then you lose at everything."
"Can we just have nation wide daily parades for these people?

Jk, it still wouldn't be enough.

Fuck off before we get fed up."
"How many jackasses are going to claim that they're neurodivergent just to get away with being a lazy fuck? They could then claim HIPAA laws in an effort not to prove their ""disability"" to employers."
"This is incredibly stupid. Diversity and inclusion means giving everyone an equal shot at achieving things despite their individual strengths and weaknesses, not accepting mediocrity or making excuses for their failings."
Neurodivergent? I‚Äôve been on this earth for many years and have never heard this one. These idiots make up new excuses every single day.
If the job gets done well who gives a shit.
Guys can I be a victim now because I have ADHD? Woohoo
"Depends on the job. Some kind of jobs can offer that kind of flexibility, some just can't. Don't try and fit a square peg in a round hole, and life will be better for everybody."
"Wait, I thought those were ‚Äúwhite‚Äù traits and that the notion of not having a ‚Äúseat at the table‚Äù also applied to POCs? So are we also implying POCs are all neurodivergent too?

"Translation:

"Equality. If you're a bad worker you're a bad worker; that simple doesn't matter what your race, religion, gender identity or mental state is. And if it's truly disabling autism where you can't function in society and or at a job they should be under supervision and government assistance."
Maybe stop using your condition as an excuse for poor judgement? Source: I'm neuro divergent with several awards for perfect attendance.
Great. I can be a crap employee and blame it on being neurodivergent. I have been formally diagnosed with social anxiety and informally with Asperger's.
Uhg
"So, in other words, bend the entire world around to watch your comforts and preferences? I am actually very open with my students and if they inform me about anything they struggle with, not only to I appreciate it, but I work with them. However, to simply demand all of that from anyone while the person on the other side is trying to 1) run a business 2) run a classroom 3) run a non-profit 4) run a team - is just insane. That will burn the boss/manager/coach out so quickly and that's not fair at all."
"So to this persons point, it needs to be both sides. I have heavy adhd and do all these. The thing is, sure I‚Äôm late all the time but then I‚Äôll stay late all the time. I‚Äôm frequently disorganized but I‚Äôll do lots of stuff twice. Pretty emotional but it doesn‚Äôt matter because I‚Äôve pushed myself to be amazing at my job so negative things rarely happen."
"Context is key. Most, if not all, of these things are present in all people. Everyone experiences these things at some point in life. They aren‚Äôt exclusive to neurodivergent/non-typical people. Therefore, we should be judging these individual traits based on context and not diagnosis. As someone who is in personal therapy and who has worked with, and continues to work with, people with a variety of special needs and diagnoses, I can tell you that all of these things are goals that can be worked on with professionals. Grace is important, of course, but that‚Äôs not really what‚Äôs being stated here. Giving in like this does more harm than good. It‚Äôs along the same lines as ‚Äòsupporting‚Äô psychotic disorders by playing along with a false reality."
"Yes, accept *my* truth. Ignore the actual truth."
The bigotry of soft expectations.
"I‚Äôm legitimately autistic and I think this is absolutely, brain-shattering dumb. I show up for work on time, uniform on and ready, and never call in an absence unless absolutely necessary. I‚Äôm also 99% sure they are one of those people on the internet who self-diagnose so they can get sympathy on the internet."
"I myself have a lot of issues, but I‚Äôd never expect an employer to be OK with me consistently being late, randomly calling out of work, and so forth."
This level of mental gymnastics is astounding
"I mean, this line of argumentation is stupid. But to steelman their argument what you can ""sometimes"" do is organize your company sich that arrival time for example is less important (for everybody). Where i work most meetings start later so if you are 30min later because you had a horrible night of sleep you can just work 30min longer. Some of those rules dont have to matter. But forgetting a meeting is forgetting a meeting, not acceptable."
April fools?
"No.

I accept your failings as they are, and I expect you, if I employ you, to be able to adjust around those failings whenever possible and be up front about it when you can't so I can work other resources around you."
"I have ADHD but I am totally aware that it is MY RESPONSIBILITY to manage my condition. And although there are some things that my employer does to assist me (such as allowing me to record meetings so that I am able to play back important information due to my memory issues), other things such as lateness or attendance are MY JOB to maintain. 

My condition does not excuse me from responsibility. And although legally (in the UK) I am allowed some leeway and understanding, it is not something I flaunt or abuse."
"This sounds like someone who would say something like im not normal, so I'm an exception to normal situations. Then, immediately say it's not right to say I'm not normal."
OP is jealous of people having disabilities? Great argument.
Seems like the whole world has this problem
Lmao! Hahahahahaha.........FIRED!
Bear in mind that this person would be the *first* to get *you* fired from *your* job for opposing DEI in *your* workplace.
"As someone who falls under the neurodivergent catefory, the category itself can utterly go eff itself. Who tf gave anyone the ability to put me in a box?

Ya know what I hate, being told im hands off. Cause when I walk into a room, i dont want people all like ""i gotta tolerate that guy over there"". 

And I miss out on all the good ball busting.

Forgive disorganization? Being late?

Look get the job done or not, but when at work its about the job."
Asking me to do work is a trigger for me so I'll just come in and collect a paycheck.
"So in other words, it's OK to be a neurotic asshat to your colleagues and suffer no reprisal? Ohhh BOY!"
"Being late by a few minutes once in a while is one thing, but making lateness a habit is another. 

I'm notorious for being early, but there have been a few times where I have been 5-10 minutes late, but I always let my managers know."
"Equality is so 20th century. It's about equity now. 

Imagine this in an ER. Sorry you are bleeding out sir, but the nurse assigned to help you is a bit freaked out by all the blood and is currently in the safe space room to get recalibrated. We would assign you someone else, but the other nurse is running late again. The doctor is a bit unorganized and is still trying to find where he put his glasses. Please be patient while we sort things out. Oh, you're a cis white male?   You will have to wait outside. We will get to you once everyone else has been taken care of."
This is probably the best take. You can accomodate up to a point but not at the expense where it's a material difference that its abusing the system if it was anyone else
"Yes. I'm neurodivergent and i don't expect people to just accept my negative work traits, anyone can overcome them (at least if their work environment isn't toxic)"
Perfect rebuttal.
"It's such an instructive post because it puts a big part of the game on display. Every time they shove the Overton Window to the left, it's done on the basis of equality and tolerance with the idea that there really isn't a difference in these groups and they just need ""a seat at the table."" Then once they have that encroachment established, it's ""you must reorganize your life around my situation/mental instability/philosphy,"" or as they euphemistically call it ""acceptance."""
"This is exactly it. It has NEVER been about equality. These groups, and others, want special treatment."
"Negative traits?  They‚Äôre just traits.  Some traits are necessary for employability.  That doesn‚Äôt make those positive, they just are.  

And, as a boss, I don‚Äôt have to forgive your traits or actions.  Just do your damned job."
"Depends on what type of job you have. 

If your job is to open a retail store each morning or take 911 calls, you better be super on time getting to the office. Your deadline is whenever the consumer demands it, which could be any time.

If your job is to design footwear or write technical manuals, being on time getting to an office is way less important than the ability to do the job competently and routinely. You can work odd hours so long as you meet your deadline."
"I agree. But today equality is not considered good. You must renounce equality and embrace equity, which is treating people differently to give them the same outcome. 

Yeah, it‚Äôs bullshit."
Lateness isn‚Äôt autism. It‚Äôs adhd
"Someone I currently work with is consistently (read almost daily) 3-5 minutes late. I'm not a manager and not part of their direct team, but that would absolutely not fly if I had my say. Either leave your house a few minutes earlier and maybe get to work early for a change, or walk out the door."
100%
Because people don‚Äôt understand the difference between equality and equity. We should give people equal chances. We should not free them from consequences.
"Try the other way around: accept those traits from everyone. Punctuality is not a virtue. Canceling last minute when that negatively affects others is frustrating, but sometimes it's necessary. However, flexibility is a virtue, but don't confuse tolerating abuse as flexibility."
"equality of opportunity vs equity of outcome

The first is something to strive for, the second destroys nations"
"I agree, but my COO doesn't. He's continuously stated that ""It's about equity, not equality.""  We're not allowed to fire people unless they're straight white males."
"I think in some cases, ""equity"" might be appropriate for people who need accommodations due to disabilities. But not appropriate for race or ethnicity."
"100% this. I can at some level sympathize with these opinions (as the hardcore lefty I am) but you HAVE to learn to deal with your neurodivergent inclinations if you ever want to become a reliable and competent member of society.

Suck it up and do what you need to do. Then use your competence to help society develop into a place you'd be proud to contribute to.

This is coming from a person with ADHD."
">crossing 

You're a little late."
It's not a disability. There is no need to compensate for being tardy because it's generally not a bad thing.
I was wondering when someone with relevant ND realities might chime in
Same. And i really hate that people like this think they can speak for me. I don't want to be treated differently. Thats the reason why I don't even bring it up at work.
"I've had ADD my whole life.  Took concerta for over a decade.  None of this stuff would help me either, but what has helped me is extra accountability."

"I'd say it depends on how much their disorganization impacts every one else, and whether they're taking steps to improve it.

I assume at least for autism, you might be able to get the employee into a specific routine that finds habits that reduce mistakes and lost time."
Even forgiving disorganization I can only allow on a 3-strikes basis.
In today's day and age lateness is less and less excusable than it was 20-30 years ago. Today everybody has a smartphone on them which can give you appointment alerts and notifications. I rely heavily on these as I can easily get sucked into a project and completely lose track of time. It's also one of the reasons why I have a cuckoo clock in my house. It's a subtle reminder that 30 minutes has gone by each time it goes off. I don't always cognitively recognize it but it's a subconscious poke more than anything.
"This is really it, here. Take responsibility for yourself. Just because you have neurodivergence doesn't mean people should condone bad behavior. And most of these neurodivergencies also come along with benefits as well, not just challenges. I know that I'm just not very effective in a role that requires tons of multi-tasking. However, I blow most people out of the water if I am responsible for 1 major task (it helps if I find that task interesting). So I went to work in an industry that I find interesting, and that greatly rewards people with long attention spans for doing 1 thing. In the event that I need to multi-task, I know I need to make a list or I will just go in circles getting 5% of each thing done. With the list to tell me what to do, I can crank it out. I also set alarms like you. Take responsibility for yourself and be a good team mate and your boss/team won't give a shit the times that you fail. Though if its a really great team, they might make fun of you."
Because degeneracy is not an easy sell.
"Al qaeda has now gone over to giving their demands in the following manner:

"You forget, these are the same people who advocate for Universal Basic Income. They feel entitled to a certain level of living for just existing."
I second this wholeheartedly as a fellow sufferer of adhd.
All it does is make me want to rebel against it more than I already do.
"Their problem is that they think they're due more than basic civility.

That's the level they and everyone else ""accept"" others at when they're not really interested.  Civility is literally what *civil*ization is built on.

They're talking about more than basic considerations and even accommodation requirements.

""Accept neurodivergent realities""  I already do this, I accept reality.  Singular.  There is only one.  Delusion does not create some splinter or alternate reality.

No one gets a seat at the table, respect, or ""acceptation"" by default.  These things are typically earned, not granted out of hand.

[Acceptation](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/acceptation) ACCEPTANCE *especially* : favorable reception or approval

I use that variation because it is precisely what they mean.  Approval, validation, positive reaction

It is a narcissistic manipulation at root.

>""If you don't make me feel special, you get punished!""

That's the thought process.

They're *not* actually neurodivergent enough to say that out-loud, apparently they are capable of seeing it as bad...but they want to express it anyways, so they run it through the PR filter to try to sneak it past.

>""If you're not inclusive, that is... *problematic*.""

Nevermind that it is clearly a double standard, inherently not even equitable, much less equality minded.  The woke null state, their default scenario, is that some people are more deserving than others, almost as if they were born into it, like they are aristocrats."
Well said
Many of people pushing have no jobs...
I like this a lot.
Sounds like you're a babysitter
LOL.
"Good point. The same concept is true for people that break laws, I can empathize on a case by case basis, but its not excusable and we shouldn't tolerate destructive behavior. Excuse and victim culture is a cancer that spreads to healthy cells.."

That was actually more reasonable than it first sounds: Van Halen demanded a bowl of M&Ms with the brown ones removed because it was an easy way to tell if the venue wasn't paying attention to other, more important parts of the contract."
The term you‚Äôre looking for is disabled. As someone who‚Äôs disabled cognitively I really hate the term neurodivergent.

"Most employers or organizations have Policies and Processes to follow,. such as (a loose generic example):

* a pattern of employee behavior starts cropping up.. your Supervisor or Manager talks to you about it,. maybe gives you a verbal warning (assuming of course.. the pattern is an obvious thing.. such as ""you were late to work 7 days in a row"".. or some other unarguable violation)

* If the pattern continues (even after verbal warning). .you're given a written warning and given a time-scope to correct the behavior (maybe 30 days, 60 days, 90 days etc) 

* If you still don't correct the behavior.. multiple written warnings turn into HR action to put you on PIP (performance improvement plan) or maybe just flat terminated (depending on the severity of the violation,. say for example you are sexually harrassing other employees,. that could be severe enough to just get you immediately terminated).. or other safety related examples like drunk-driving. 

This is less of a ""hard policy"" thing.. and more of a ""how (ethically) do you treat your employees?""

* If you know an Employee is going through a hard time (depression, death of a significan other, house burned down ,. etc).. your Organization may not have any policy around that,. but it is the correct and ethical thing to give them a bit more understanding and flexibility 

* You can't discriminate against specific individual employees. So whatever Policy or allowances have to be fair and equitable across all your employees. if an Employee wants to be on a modified schedule for religious reasons (Muslim, Catholic during Lent, etc).. or if a Pregnant woman evolves through her pregnancy,. or if a specific Employee is neuro-divergent (autistic, diagnosed with ADHD, diagnosed with some specific Depressive condition, etc).. you may be legally obligated to use good judgement to shape some accommodations around them. 

How an organization treats it's people.. is more about just ""good human ethical behavior"".. than it is ""what you're legally obligated to do""."
"Don't say such heretical things as ""personal responsibility""! They'll cry and make a tweet or a tik tok about it for not being treated fai... for not being treated the way they want."
We‚Äôve allowed the wrong people to run it
"In a professional environment you're okay with lateness, last minute cancelations and emotional disregulation? How does that work for coworkers forced to pick up the slack or deal with emotionally charged coworkers?"
"Context: I'm a neuropsychologist (focus on brain injuries, strokes, general cognitive functioning)

I'm with you, and of course there's more latitude to be given when it's more severe. 

The reality is autism traits fall on a spectrum, at it's core is social cognition. Some people are very socially adept and might be called social butterflies, charismatic, etc. On the other end we have very severe autism where the person can grasp that others have their own mind and will. We all fall somewhere in between. Where the demarcation point is for a _disorder_ comes down to functional impairment. There's more to it but that's a core truth and it's the same for things like intelligent deficits, ADHD, etc. 

The issue is there's a trend to get diagnosed from Dr. Social media. There are people who overly embrace the neurodivergent term when they aren't, or it's very mild.  They identify some traits that by definition _we all have some times_ (even a social butterfly occasionally fails to read the room, or make a poorly timed comment) and call it a disorder then demand acceptance and equity in results. 

They aren't many. And I've seen more online it seems, but I have worked with some people that fall into category and it can be very grating telling them they don't have a disorder, that they're cognitively healthy."
Absolutely not a troll post. This was on my feed from a legit account
">I have no problem with these issues from people with autism.  I don't think anybody would. 

In the workplace? Yes I would have a problem with all of this stuff."
No I wouldn‚Äôt. I posted this because I am unclear as to where to draw the line on what counts as ‚ÄúReasonable Accommodation‚Äù vs abusing the disability.
"Agreed, at what point at the exceptions excessive?"
"Lmao. Most blue states have the exact same laws as that red state you are talking about. Public educators molest more children than religious leaders...by a wide margin. 

If you support Teacher unions, you support the abuse of children."
That‚Äôs why I posted this because I struggle to identify the line between accommodation and enabling here.
Nope just wondering where the line should be drawn between Enabling and making Reasonable Accommodations
"I'm a bit ashamed to admit that when I saw ""I'm autistic as hell"" at the start and was like ""oh sure ok""

Then I read the comment and was like ""nope, there's no way that someone who isn't autistic as hell could have made this up"""
Let's elect this guy/gal for president.
This is the way
Good for you. That‚Äôs a solid work day.
"I do all of the above, but I haven‚Äôt been calling myself ‚Äúautistic as hell‚Äù. I can still pass as normal most days. More like a light dash of autism. Unless I‚Äôm just in denial"
This is my favorite comment of all time
"I miss my last job. I was salaried with eligibility for over time. I punched a clock at the start and end of the day. If I worked more than 8 I got paid for it, less than 8. Still got paid and was all good as long as there was an email my boss.

HR got into some trouble with how they had people classified as hourly or salaried, a 3rd party interviewed a bunch of us about are job and made recommendations. Most of the salaried with no over time people got 15-20% raises too. 

I frequently stayed late at least once a week to help out a team. Never cared if I had to stay as it was usually known about I‚Äôm advanced and I liked the over time."
Yeah autists like me are on time.  It's people who think they're better than everyone else who are always late.
This whole thing is giving me major [Clock King vibes](https://youtu.be/LlM-YxFxFjc).
"> .... Although that's mostly because I'm a cantankerous shit and promptness goes both ways. Once I'm no-longer being paid to care.... Their problems stop being my problem until the following day and I put them from my mind entirely.
> 
> I also make no pretense that it's anything more than ""just a job"" or that my loyalty to the firm extends any further than the length of my notice period.

This sounds a lot like the ""quiet quitting"" many corporations are upset about."
I had a real quiet guy on my team who was late about once a week. But he spent zero time chit chatting or otherwise playing on his phone. I always adjusted his time card and the manager before me had done the same. You gotta take care of your people
As long as you are within 7 minutes ;)
"i usually arrive at kind of random times, but im very available to whenever the firm has a random need, they dont give me problems i dont give them either and always support.  


i think it depends on the relationship with the employeer or managers."
Pretty much this. If one of my guys is late okay. But they called for the heads up. Shit happens and it isn't the end of the world. It when its 30mins + late and no one has heard from you that could be an issue (over slept? kay at least you called)
"I agree with this statement so much.  I think once the individual ""gets a seat at the table"", it's up to that person to adapt to the table rules.  Not the table changes all the rules to suit the individuals."
"They also expect to have more rights than everyone else. I have compassion for Autistic people. My granddaughter is autistic.  But I draw the line at going overboard on letting them get away with stuff that those who are not neurodivergent can't. At times I think they use it like a crutch ü©º.  Same with every ""protected"" class. They know they can screw off and not get called on it. Managers are afraid of a lawsuit if they do write them up or fire them.  It leaves the rest of us covering our ass because we will get fired."
"Eh, I dunno, constant tardiness, calling out, cancelling plans etc, I consider those negative."
You can work odd hours if it's allowed in the job description. If everyone's there 8-5 and the office closes at 5 and you're always late you're not working the same and then forcing someone else to work over with you.
"You don‚Äôt have to.   
You‚Äôre pressured to.
But you don‚Äôt have to.

Edit:
Equity is socialism.  
Period.
As of right now, despite some efforts, we do not live in a socialist country."
It‚Äôs just tardiness.  It‚Äôs not necessarily caused by some disease.
"I had a coworker that would show up at 7:58 and then spend the next 15-30 minutes making her breakfast and coffee in the break room everyday.  Finally the boss said ""work starts at 8"", she goes ""I'm here before 8 everyday"".  To which he replied ""you are here but, you aren't working"".  She cried and she was like 45."
We have about 20 guys in our company that fit that description. Right now they get away with it because we are desperate for warm bodies to work. Market shifts the other way and they‚Äôll be fired quick.
"Are they an otherwise productive employee?

Are they taking the cigarette breaks some others are?"
Sorry for the ignorance but what difference does 3-5 minutes make?
"For me it depends what kind of job too. In some jobs being late is holding everyone else up too and causing a difficulty when short staffed, in others it‚Äôs really doesn‚Äôt make a difference and is too small to care about. I‚Äôd question them about it though, sometimes it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre juggling kids and other factors, and if that were the case I‚Äôd let 3-5mins slide it‚Äôs pretty insignificant. I‚Äôve known people who frequently came in 30-45mins late, now that is bad"
3-5 minutes really sends you over the edge?
Equity is a made-up term that just means quotas and enforcing equal outcomes. I don‚Äôt know why we are all acting like it‚Äôs some sort of important phrase or word. Equality as a concept didn‚Äôt have any sort of defect
Lawsuit time!
"Yes, that's a fair point. I can't expect someone whose legs don't work to use the stairs because it's equal."
I know a programmer with ADHD was using his experiences to program a app to help people focus and not get distracted. Excellent use of using his learn skills to share with others.
"There are different types and styles of ADHD, so it presents differently with most, but I tend to agree that removing structure entirely does NOT help anything. ADHD is rather insidious, but being held accountable is important. I need to be given a break from time to time, not treated with kid gloves."
I'm also ND. The only thing that would work for me is flexibility...but that's covered under my accommodations.
The old Negligent Discharge.
"Agreed, extra accountability and structure helps a lot. I used to hold off on school papers, projects until nearly last minute and rush it all out in a matter of hours before class. Procrastination and creating high stress situations is both a symptom and a coping mechanism.

Also ADD is now considered part of ADHD, it‚Äôs the Inattentive presenting type."
"Technically accurate however I would say ""won't adapt"" instead of ""won't change""."
"Disorganization is relative. I had a teacher in high school who would grade binder organization based on her standards for what organized means, and she consistently failed me. I got an A on every test in her class and only missed one homework assignment because of an illness the entire year. So despite being ""horrifically disorganized,"" I never lost a paper or had any trouble retreiving anything asked of me within like thirty seconds.  She still would dock 10 points from my grade and pit notes on my report cards, saying that I had poor organizational skills. Different types of organization work for different people, and as long as it isn't impacting my work, it shouldn't matter how organized it appears to you."
"Unless their lack of organization is directly affecting their job performance, it really shouldn't matter."
"Disorganization at what though? If you have a messy, cluttered, disorganized desk, who cares? It only effects you. 
Disorganized during a presentation to a group though. That I can see being a problem that needs addressing"
"It may seem disorganized to an outsider, but there is a method to the madness and the chaos."
">Because degeneracy is not an easy sell.

I'm not sure what about this is ""degenerate""."
"Have you not been paying attention to what's happening in medicine and science? They are no longer the areas of logic, reasoning and clinical objectiveness. They have always been victims of their own ego, pomp, prejudice and pride. But now they are idealogs pushing social and political agendas."
"I was thinking more of terms rooted in for instance feminist theory. But when speaking to a common audience, it is best to minimize specialised jargon."
"So, we have look up the medical terms for their mental disorders. Got it.üëç"
Very well stated.
"Thanks, and although my wife and I helped as much as we could navigating with doctors and hospitals my son is really the hero of his own story."
What does this even mean?
Yes.  A lack of personal accountability is TOTALLY like segregation.
Oh.. you know...
"The ADA requires ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù accommodations.  (People often forget the ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù part.) 
I think it would be hard to assert that allowing someone to be chronically late, unreliable, and difficult to work with as ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù.

At a local supermarket we had a young ND woman working as a cashier a while back.  She would grab people hands as they were signing their names on the pad for credit card purchases if she didn‚Äôt like the way they held the stylus.  She‚Äôd then force them to sign their names holding it in the manner she wanted.  Allowing her to retain the cashier position would most likely be unreasonable.  However they could probably have found her a job stocking shelves or doing inventory."
"In 100% of my experiences with anyone who has ever said ""neurodivergent"", all of them were self-diagnosed. I will always immediately dip the fuck out the minute someone begins to utter that ridiculous word."
Yep.  It could go terribly.
"This is the sort of response I was hoping for! One that doesn't challenge my world view in any way, shape, or form. One that can keep me in my ignorance and justify my hatred/discrimination towards people I don't like or understand. 
Yes, some if not most of these are worded poorly and are over the top but you arnt here to talk about the vast majority of ADA requests that are within reason. You are here to fear monger.
Guess what? You do have to accept things that would get other people fired in the workplace. Those other workers don't have a neurological condition that makes simply existing in society a daily challenge. So give them noise canceling headphones, or give them a extended deadline and you can be the crybaby snow flake in the corner whining about how you don't get the same things as well. You are the exact reasons why these laws exist."
My comment was more about the agencies within the federal government than it was a private organization.
"When an employee has Autism, it is to be expected when you hire them. 

They are usually in low level rolls, if it becomes a continuous issue, it is delt with."
Sounds like working under any other under-qualified manager which is very commonplace in corporate environments.
"I worked with a guy with autism, he was a dishwasher, a very good one. One week he didn't show up for a few days straight, and we started to become concerned. The GM ended up going to his apartment to check on him, and found him rocking in the center of his room disoriented. 

The reason he couldn't get to work, is because his brother used to walk him to the bus every day he had to work, and unfortunately his brother passed away. He was completely lost without him. 

Very sad situation, I think about him often. I wish I knew how he turned out. He loved to wash dishes and was great at it. 

Just sad situation all aorund"
"Then you are probably not in a workplace where it is appropriate to have co-workers with Downs. 

Those who are in a workplace where it is appropriate to have co-workers with Downs, probably are not.

It's not a workplace for every environment, understandably."
What that person said seems fair to me.
"Well, I read it and went, ""Shit, I'm autistic."""
Right? Exact same thought process!
This is the way.
"I think many of us have a light dash of autism. I know I do. I also don't understand lateness at all. You agreed to start work at X, if you can't get there on time, that's your problem unless of course something happens that's out of your control like an accident or excessive traffic or the bus came late. 

Change your habits to fulfill your agreements (e.g., getting up 20 minutes earlier), or, create a routine that creates a little buffer zone of time. I made sure I came in early to work everyday because I sure as hell didn't want to come in late if my bus was full along the route, or was late. 

Hell, I'm moving to a different city for work and I'll have to change my habits. Should I be whining to management instead to let me come in late because I like to get up late? At some point there are just things you gotta live with. But apparently they don't want to do that anymore because somehow it's oppressive?"
"Just wanted to say THANK  you. If someone's productive in 7 hours 50 minutes but is sometimes 10 minutes late, I don't really care. And you're a good boss if you can recognize that and appreciate it.   


I really wish more jobs would shift to a productivity schedule rather than a buts in seats schedule. I get it for customer facing jobs, but not backend ones."
The difference between being a leader and being a manager.
"To give a somewhat sympathetic take on their view, they have a severe focus on the labor aspect of the economy and institutions. To them the economy and institutions are almost fake things that don't exist to produce goods and services or, e.g., with the military to be the most effective fighting force possible. They exist as make-work programs for people they like (and to promote left wing causes and philosophy generally). So, if your business or institution has some standard that exists because it promotes excellence and some identity group isn't meeting those standards at the same levels as other groups, those standards need to be removed."
"You gotta get to work, and do something for an hour first, than go make breakfast."
People don't take criticism as a need for change anymore. They just take offense.
I have one of these.
"Probably trying to set up a ""hostile work environment"" lawsuit for when she inevitably gets fired or she has enough incidents documented for her to quit and file her lawsuit.
I mean, how the hell do you CRY over someone just saying ""you aren't working""?"
But does she have a real job anyways?  See simply stopping making breakfast is not productive.  It's only productive if you use that time to do something.  Many jobs involve basically not that.
"The short answer?

It‚Äôs a bad habit and depending on the job, that time seriously adds up fast"
"So, I suppose the employee wouldn't mind just a little bit taken out of their pay, just every so often?

I mean, what difference does a few dollars make?"
"Not a lot every now and then, but I work somewhere that already has built in set up time before we get to work (arrive at 8:30, get everything ready for the day, then start at 9). When someone is arriving at 8:35 every day then the set up that they would normally be responsible for is shifted to someone else and sets the entire team behind."
"It displays the inability to follow simple instructions and be part of a team.  You are right, what difference *does* 3-5 minutes make?  That individual needs to leave their house 3-5 minutes earlier every day.  Maybe that means they don't hit snooze, or have to wake up 10 minutes earlier to show that they are a valuable, dependable member of a team and can be relied on."
Somebody that is consistently late shows that they don‚Äôt have any respect for the time of others.
Take 3-5 minutes spread across 12 employees each day and it's a whole labor hour. Across a standard month that's a part time employee worth of productivity lost.
Let's say 5 mins everyday across 10 employees.... about 4000 a year at 20$ an hour...
Shitty low end jobs in the service sector and factories want to get every last second out of you.
"Hey, those 3 - 5 minutes add up over time. That‚Äôs dozens, *dozens* of dollars the company is losing! Please, won‚Äôt somebody please think of the giant corporations?? : ("
To be honest: your asking questions above your paycheck.
"For me, with employees, it's about if they are there when I 100% need them.  Life is life and traffic is traffic.   If I am consistently getting the work I need from them done at a high quality and by set deadlines, and on days when arrival time really matters they are there on time, then I just don't sweat it day-to-day.  
   
When I have good people, I try to give them the space to stay productive, even if it means they are often late.  They are willing to work late, come in weekends when needed, and if I express that a day is a must be on time day they get there on time. 
   
Ultimately, I think my flexibility in this regard reduces turn.  I get to keep people not getting paid a lot longer than I would expect to otherwise."
specifically screw whitey is what it means.  No one I like talks that way.
Okay but this doesn‚Äôt change the elephant in the room that a lot of psycho bosses can and will. ADHD isn‚Äôt immediately apparent to an observer.
"There are three prominent types of adhd-

Inattentive presenting- these are the daydreamers, the ones who get lost in thought and can‚Äôt seem to stay focused, or get extremely fixated on one thing.

Hyper-active presenting- the k
Ones who sit still and always seem to have a second-fifth wind before passing out on the floor.

Combination presenting- a mix of the two. Though there are many variations on this, like a sliding scale, sometimes one side overpowers the other.

Regardless adhd needs structure. It used to be an evolutionary advantage to have quick focus, snap decision making, and able to act in an instant. 

At our core: human beings are still a Hunter/gatherer species. That will never change."
"Same here, flexibility is an important accommodation, but the rest just makes me feel like you are patronizing me."
"There is a difference between people being able to compensate for their disorganization and those that can‚Äôt compensate.  Disorganization that leads to repetitive mistakes will be a problem in any industry.  We all have weaknesses, it‚Äôs how you compensate for/overcome them that makes us employable/promotable.  There may be reasonable accommodations an employer can provide, but it will ultimately be on the employee if they remain employable.  It sounds like you compensate for your disorganization well."
"There's such a thing as being so disorganized that it affects other people's job performance. If you can't find a document that your boss is requesting because you have everything all over the place, that makes the boss have to wait an unnecessary amount of time for that document to be sent to him, if it is ever even found. Then the boss won't be able to use that document for whatever he needed it for. Say, he needs to proofread it before sending it up the chain of command. Now command has to wait longer because you are disorganized."
"If your disorganization affects productivity, it affects other people, and is not acceptable."
"When disorganization affects more than yourself, it is not acceptable.

I will need those TPS reports by tomorrow morning.

Tomorrow morning comes, no TPS reports sent in.

Sorry, I couldn't find it in the mess I have all over my desk.

A week later, oh there it is! Too late now."
"Showing up late to work regularly, disorganization, lack of emotional regulation, etc (and using neurodivergence as an excuse) is degenerated.  You're not entitled to being coddled like a child, especially from your employer.  We all have flaws, but it's incumbent on all of us to do our best to overcome them (not embrace them as neurodivergent).  Divergence from what is efficient, regulated, and organize that facilitates being a fully self-actualized human being is degenerated.  Overlooking some divergence is necessary, but if it becomes a habit that inhibits workplace effectiveness, then pushback is necessary from your supervisor.  Pre-dispositions are just that, they only become destiny if we allow them to be."
You live in the internet don‚Äôt you. You know there‚Äôs a whole big world out there where a tiny minority is ultra woke
"So we‚Äôre anti-scientific now. Great. Tell that to Massey, who just tried to use data in a gun debate and got shouted down by an emotional NY democrat. Jesus wept."
"But isn‚Äôt this person just highlighting those with autism and adhd? There didn‚Äôt seem to be a sex-based bias. 

On an aside, thanks for a mature response. This sub is trying it‚Äôs hardest to play gutter-ball this morning."
"Sure, because I‚Äôm not a scientist. But I try to learn, not just repeat talking points from media organizations manipulating me for their own agendas. You should try touching the grass‚Ä¶there‚Äôs a whole wide world out there.

Edit: I can‚Äôt even respond because you blocked me ü§° sensitivity isn‚Äôt just for the woke, apparently."
"I didn‚Äôt make the original post. In my career history of the military and the medical field, there would not be much accommodations that could be made to fit what was listed up there. So it‚Äôs hard for me to understand it from my limited perspective. It is not fear mongering, it has been interesting reading all the responses."
Someone somewhere might be offended to hear they are only expected to perform in low level roles‚Ä¶.
"So the coworker who is waiting for the employee with autism to arrive so they can finish their shift is just out of luck?

How is it dealt with if it becomes continuous? This tweet is saying you should accept it, that it is the norm for an employee with autism so you should just accept it....the opposite of what you're saying about dealing with it if it becomes the norm. 

And you raise an interesting point in saying when you hire an employee with autism it's to be expected,  is it okay then to not hire someone with autism so p you aren't stuck dealing with these problems?"
That‚Äôs an example I could get behind for this post referring to. But unfortunately it probably is the exception and not the rule.
"In my two major career fields, a majority of those demands would not be able to be met."
I had the exact same response.  Coupled with the fact that my wife has been trying to convince me that I'm autistic for years... I think I might be autistic.
Same here!
"I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one, haha."
"Honestly I would probably benefit from a similar level of regimentation, I just can't bring myself to do it."
"In the old days working past the clock made you eligible for promotion because you were dedicated.....

That's ball scratchin time
"She'd have ""healthy"" snacks like carrots and celery with ranch throughout the day. 

**NSFL WARNING** She would take like two cups of ranch in a bowl and use the celery or carrots like a spoon.  I shit you not, she didn't eat the vegetables.  She could have used her fingers or a spoon and it'd accomplish the same thing.  You can imagine what she looked like.  She couldn't be fired because of ADA and they essentially made her an overpaid admin/secretary."
"Honestly, not really.  We are supposed to be in the field 50% of the time but, she is physically unable to do so.  She did this before I started but,  apparently she just decided one day she wasn't going into the field anymore.  Everyone was ok with it because she was worthless in the field anyways.  They assigned her office duties that the admin was doing so then the admin started doing some mlm/pyramid scheme thing during work because her workload was so reduced (which was really like an hour a day most days, they just wanted a receptionist to IDK seem important).  So anyways the crybaby has all the admin roles and is getting paid very well for someone doing the job of someone that was getting paid like $15/hr.  I digress but it was a total joke and just goes to show how much large corporations are afraid of a lawsuit."
Do you get paid from 8:30?
"Got it. That makes sense. I was picturing a different work environment, but yeah, I can see how that‚Äôd become a headache here."
"Depends on the reason. Some people have children they have to take to school, sometimes multiple kids to multiple schools, and school traffic is a nightmare. There‚Äôs only so early you can reasonably drop a 6 year old off in front of a school. And kids aren‚Äôt exactly easy to wrangle either. I know their life their problem, but I do have a soft spot for people who are just doing their best with what they have and not trying to slack."

Stealing is wrong no matter who is doing it
Sounds very reasonable
"I'm the 1st one...I can't focus worth a shit if I'm not CONSTANTLY doing something, and even then I always write down everything I'm doing, because the minute I lose concentration for 1 sec my brain dumps everything and I forget what I'm doing. 

I'm not sure if everyone has this, but I have a constantly running inner monologue that never stops, which tends to crowd out other thoughts...I don't know if this is actually ADD if just social anxiety though

Notebooks are my best friend. I lose my concentration have no idea what I'm doing...look what I wrote down 5 minutes ago lol. 

Honestly I hate that I'm not ""Normal"" but ya, no excuse not to do my job right. Having an issue just means you have something to overcome. I may never be the best worker in the world, but I'll be damned if I'll be a shitty one"
"Right. I don't need to be babied or have my hand held. I need patience and proper accommodations!

If I mess up, don't be afraid to tell me what I did wrong!"
"Organization is also one of those things anyone can best by setting goals and seeing them through,  even autists, and with proper practice it becomes second nature"
"In my experience, this really isn't the case with people called ""disorganized."" People have their own perceptions for what organization should look like and like I said, if something isn't impacting my work, then it shouldn't bother you. I was called disorganized my entire school and early working life, but never struggled with timeliness or finding things that were needed. In fact, in early jobs, I consistently had high performance reviews while at the the same time being told that I was too disorganized."
"So... just what I said... 

Agreed"
Fair point. I try to keep my professional area organized. Granted I also work in a highly physical job so I‚Äôm continually active. I honestly don‚Äôt think I could stand working at a desk for 8 or 9 hours.
"> We all have flaws, but it's incumbent on all of us to do our best to overcome them (not embrace them as neurodivergent).

I agree to a point, but I also think society benefits when we are realistic about the different ways people operate and can be efficient / capable. Like, IEPs are life-changing for many kids in school. That benefits all of us."
"Doesn't matter if it's a tiny minority if the people in positions of authority, governance, science, medicine and policy are either infected themselves or kowtowing to that small minority."
"Unfortunately it's not popular to brain anymore. All science (and evidence in general) is invalid because ""woke"", or it doesn't agree with so-called common sense. Unless of course it aligns with something we want. Unfortunately this isn't a new development in this space. 

There *is* inherently a *prosocial* bias in the social sciences - the study of human behavior is motivated by the desire to help people and improve. For example, a clinical psychologist is next to useless if they just sit there and observe - it's the dialogue that helps to drive the patient to a conclusion. It's also not acceptable to promote machiavellianism - because that's bad. So the bias is always towards ""good"". 

That bias is fine, in and of itself, but where it slams into reality and makes waves is where it's not handled well.

If that tweet/LinkedIn post/whatever said: don't be a micromanager and a Nazi about aspects of the working environment that don't really matter, there'd probably be less controversy. There are plenty of shitty, petty AF bosses - especially at entry level - and these fiefdom lords need intro to leadership and anger management courses. The way this post is phrased, weaponizing science, that message pisses people off, particularly those who are easily triggered by ""woke"". Even if the message is correct, or at least its intentions are good. For jobs that don't actually require ass in chair (to interact with customers, operate machinery on a line, etc) , there's little benefit to being a dick about *occasional* lateness, for example. Traffic sucks, trains run late, etc etc. *Chronic* lateness is a separate issue. 

Historically, conservatives have been the ones going on moral crusades. Usually, those crusades do more harm in the long run than good (war on drugs, etc). The ""woke"" movement is simply progressives doing the same shit for a change. It's the logical conclusion to the prior SJW/microaggression/safe space arc. The smart move would be to inject some well-reasoned sanity into the conversation instead of reflexively clutching pearls about ""woke"", but that would be bad for ratings."
"You're welcome. I'm not sure what the person is talking about other than ""neurodivergent"" people, so not really anything to do with woke or feminism.

"The military doesn't let you enlist with conditions like Autism for a reason. An autistic employee getting an extended deadline doesn't put people's lifes in danger in a office setting but very much could in a millitary/hospital depending on the m.o.s or occupation. so yes, some occupations can not reasonably accommodate Autism or other conditions. There's clauses in the Americans With Disabilities Act for that exact reason. 
Yes, you didnt make it but your still shilling it out. If you disagreed with it in anyway you should of prefaced that instead of spreading this garbage. Look at the comments of people saying that they wouldn't hire anybody with Autism because of this. You are spreading that hatred and bigotry. Nobody forced you to post this. Conveniently, you only really reply to one's that reinforce your opinions, though. 
You have literally the near whole sum of human knowledge in your pocket at nearly all times. There is no excuse for ignorance anymore. Hell, you even have AI that can do the research for you and put it in an easily understandable format, but instead of doing your research prior to this, you post the worst example you could find of accommodation and make it seem like it's the norm. Whether you did that intentionally or unintentionally, it still causes damage.

"Someone, but probably not the one with the job...... Never worked with a person with Downs that didn't want and love to be there"
"Lets be clear, some latitude is to be expected, as it should when you hire someone with Downs. 

Just like with any employee if it becomes continuous, they will be terminated.

But, it is to be expected that they will probably not perform in high functioning jobs ( at least in my experience ) .. 

If they take a little bit longer to take out the trash, or it takes them a bit longer to walk from the break room to the kitchen to get back to work, its pretty normal. If they need a few minutes outside to gather themselves and get focused, so be it. 

In my many years of experience in hotels, we had many outreach programs with local Autism homes. 

\---   is it okay then to not hire someone with autism so p you aren't stuck dealing with these problems

In my experience you hire them for the role. You wouldn't want to put anyone in a role they cannot perform in, more importantly a role where they would injure themselves or others. So of course, but there are positions ( especially in large hotels, which is where I worked for many years ) where they can excel and do great, with a little bit of understanding..."

"It sounds like both you and the kid need to go to bed earlier.  None of what you listed is an acceptable reason to be constantly 3-5 minutes late to work.  If, during the interview, I told you that the job starts at 8:00, and you told me that the best you could do was 8:03 - 8:05, I would immediately ask you if you had any questions for me and start thinking about the next applicant.

If hired, do you think a person consistently late (no matter the excuse) should get the same bonus package as a person who was on-time, let alone early to work every day?"
"Also work with people & managers who have young kids. For managers it's easy they just schedule themselves to come in to work a bit later. They're salaried anyway so the lost time on the clock doesn't make a difference, but they also do a ton of extra work on the back end I don't want any part of. Take that trade every time. 

An hourly employee who wanted to be scheduled to be at work a bit later because of obligations to their family should discuss that with their boss so that they make up for the time on the clock (or don't, just be scheduled appropriately). No reason they should be on the clock for their child delivery service, put the kids on the bus. Guess my real complaint is that people showing up late to work results in punctual co-workers being held responsible for missed work."

"The article brings up some interesting points. Resonance in academia is important, as is open mindedness. But the scientific process is still a bedrock.

I don‚Äôt know how many times this needs to be said:

That. Is. Literally. The. Point.

The Democrats **want** Trump as their opponent in 2024. They don‚Äôt want DeSantis. They don‚Äôt want Haley. They don‚Äôt want Pompeo or Pence or Scott or Noem. They want Trump because they know Trump gives them the best chance of winning.

I'm not saying do nothing, and actions have to have consequences, BUT its a hell of a tightrope to walk, and if it becomes a fight of principles-be-damned then that throws out the people where principles are what drive them and weaken your own alliance in the name of a cathartic release."

"This fear is very reasonable. To be clear, I'm not saying that an ex-president shouldn't be charged and convicted of a crime if he committed one before, during, or after he's in office. I'm saying that, in today's divided and distrustful environment, when you bring a politically-divisive prosecution like this, you have to make sure that your case is bulletproof and avoid even the appearance that you're playing games. What you should never do is concoct a novel legal theory to criminalize and imprison a person merely because you dislike him; which is arguably what this prosecution is."

"Everything the leftists use to go after their opponents just opens up the floodgate when they are no longer in charge. you would think they would have learned when they removed filibuster from judges approval that caused Trump being able to get a majority of Conservative Judges on SCOTUS. but no, here they go again.

Not trying to be rude, but have you been paying attention for the past decade or more?

"has it crossed your mind that, even though he's a jerk, he's right? and he's always been right?"
"impeaching Biden wouldn't help. not because ""oh no it's mean"", but because he's a massive liability to the Dems. Every time he opens his mouth they have to play damage control. and even if we did get rid of him, we get president Kamala, who is not an improvement."
Gop lacks a supermajority to remove Biden and would just end up with Harris. Impeachment is a good pr stunt for the Left because they control the media.
I‚Äôd prefer to avoid contributing to our Banana Republic status.
And Biden should be impeached weekly until the end of his term.
This right here.  Yes.  And it pisses me off to no end.  Why can‚Äôt Republicans grow an effing spine???
"And republicans shouldn‚Äôt. If republicans are going to do anything, it should be to be the moral party. I don‚Äôt care if we win at the end of the day. I care that people do the right thing even when it‚Äôs hard."
And state governors who still retain their emergency powers
And all still can be.
Or if you believe in objective truth and objective morality. You don‚Äôt take the high road to win. You do it because it‚Äôs right. And you let God sort it out at the end of the day.
"During the war in the Pacific, when and where American forces discovered that the Japanese would not take American soldiers prisoner, Americans in retaliation would not take Japanese soldiers prisoner. 

>Those with morals and ethics follow them....

The purpose of morals and ethics is to get a desired end. The Dems need to get what they give. That's merely the golden rule. There cannot be two standards where your foes treat you vilely and you treat them graciously and good."
I had no idea. Guess I need to take a history lesson today.
"They only believe it because the media feeds them a steady diet of propaganda and they just consume it like obedient little sheep, then ask for seconds."
"I didn't suggest his narrative was wrong. 

I suggested he's not the guy."
"I don't care that hes a jerk. I care that he's ineffective.

He lost to a senile pervert who can't speak a full sentence for crying out loud.

He left office with his supporters in jail on horeshit charges and has done nothing to ever attemp to help them.

He has alienated and insulted the vast majority of potential allies in the fight against the deep state.

And he spent the majority of his presidency under investigations he was to ineffective to squash.

Aside from raising awareness about the deepstate he hasn't had one significant victory against it.  And his ability to raise awareness is gone, anyone who can't tell what they did to him in the last 4 years won't tell in the next 4.

If a football coach lost for 4 years, even if i liked them I'd want them out of my franchise. Thats Trump."
You still need to impeach everyone for the stunts they pulled.  Can‚Äôt let them have zero repercussions.  They started this ridiculousness.
Which is why republicans will always lose.
Taking the high road has gotten them where they are right now.  It‚Äôs. Not. Working.
But Republicans won‚Äôt do anything about it.
"After the Americans captured Dachau, some of the soldiers just couldn't handle the atrocities and slaughtered some Nazis. They were going to be investigated for this, until the case hit the desk of the military governor of Bavaria . . . Patton. Who ignored it.

I love that story."
"That doesn‚Äôt matter. Are actions should reflect our character. We don‚Äôt play to win, we do what‚Äôs right because it‚Äôs the right thing to do. I would rather live in a world where no republican ever holds office again then live in one where I have to feel ashamed of my political party."
Nope. And there in-lies part of the problem. Conservatives will be persecuted to the ends while Republican ‚Äúleaders‚Äù sit back and watch.

That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs two halves to that sentence chief.
"Can be fired yes, but likely promoted and given a raise just as likely"
So who was fired for promoting the Russia collusion hoax?
"These ""journalists"" really hold themselves in high regard."
You know the saying it's not what they say it's what they usually don't say. That's the problem. The biggest issue with our press is usually what they don't report on. But they know that and they don't care
"I mean, they rarely report anything that's true.  Especially during the Trump years, they were absolutely ridiculous.  None of them were fired for it.

Did [this guy](https://legalinsurrection.com/2023/04/wapos-glenn-kessler-posts-three-pinochios-fact-check-on-bragg-being-soros-backed-gets-schooled/) get fired?  NOPE."
How convenient they leave out intentionally or unintentionally misleading the public. (Ex. The post today about CBS refusing to report the Nashville shooter was transgender).
Usually they just get Pulitzers for false reporting.
"That is the credentialism fallacy.

Plus, some professions require a higher understanding of the mechanism of language.  Lawyers and journalists for example.  To the less sophisticated, you might think they are saying one thing when technically they are not. 

""All the hallmarks of Russian disinformation"" was a carefully crafted phrase repeated verbatim by all the pundits dismissing Hunter Biden's laptop from hell. Talking points. Most people heard ""it is Russia propaganda"" but they never said that.

Once you start parsing their words it becomes obvious."
The New York Times still proudly keeps the Pulitzer for denying Stalin‚Äôs genocide against the Ukrainians in the 1930s
"I have thousands of examples of reasons why not to trust the Press. Remember that the New York Times caved to a mob over an editorial a mob within their own company. When the news media is telling us we really need to be trusting them and that those that don't are conspiracy theorists, that's when you know you shouldn't trust them"
"Technically someone ""can"" be fired for being late, doesn't mean it's a guarantee, but going by this so called ""logic"", we can assume everyone at a ""mainstream news outlet"" is never late, otherwise they wouldn't have a job."
That have been in affect for years now.

That‚Äôs the major finding in this ‚Äúintel report‚Äù. Also:

*The Committee has seen no evidence that any votes were changed or that any voting machines were manipulated.*

So judging by the vague language of the report and the fact that it plainly states that no voting machines were manipulated, their bombshell finding is that the Russians posted a lot on social media. Get over it dude, Hillary lost."
"Collusion is the hoax, the collusion narrative was created by the Clinton campaign and laundered by the FBI using the Steele dossier through a willing media.

Victims of criminals that Bragg was soft on should volunteer to testify if there is a trial.
"When are we going to start prosecuting the judges, DAs, and all other government employees who let criminals out so easily?"
"NYC gets exactly what it voted for. I upset a liberal last week who thinks they totally got me by telling me to stay in my safe little town and away from Democrat cities if I cant handle being assaulted. I don‚Äôt think thats the ‚Äúown‚Äù he thinks it was

"Even far left MSNBC Progressives are scratching their heads over this indictment.  Paying hush money to a porn star gets a president in hand cuffs, while J6 goes unmentioned?  Boys, I wonder if Bragg is a ridiculously incompetent diversity hire who just succeeds in pulling this country further apart."
That must be the empathy I keep hearing about from the left.  Letting the vulnerable forever be victim to the wolves.
Alvin Bragg is now also fully bathed in the same spotlight light he has shone on Trump. We'll see if he can handle the heat.
"Have to blame New Yorkers at this point. This guy should have been recalled by now, but they don't seem to care"
How does this guy get away with the name Bragg but Fort Bragg has to change to Fort Liberty?
"So many law and order snowflakes here, it's astonishing. How many times have you screamed for prosecution of mostly peaceful protesters? How many times did you scream ""lock her up""? Then you break down when a grand jury hears the facts presented to them and issues many indictments? Is it that you consider fraudulently covering up a hush money payment to a porn star silencing her for having unprotected sex with her while his wife was pregnant to be s such a morally superior act? Nope, that's not it. You want politicians to violate laws, cheat, and weaponize the justice system as long as there is an R after their name, and get upset when there's even a chance of holding them accountable."
The NYPD should be ashamed of themselves.
So‚Ä¶.. worthless?
Stop official immunity for these thugs and allow victims to sue the State and watch how fast their stops.
"Alright... who is accusing him of being soft on crime? I can read a screenshot, I can see what is being presented.  I didn't see a link for an article.  Anyway, it's a pretty weird tactic to claim that this guy is soft on crime while getting trump indicted for doing nothing.  I guess I'm missing something."
It's shit like this that has me convinced they're abandoning the duties they were given when they were put in their position.
So looking forward to seeing this jackass perp-walked out in cuffs. The self-righteous with big egos always decide that laws don't apply to them.

I love the casual admission of complete ignorance. Good job.
"I‚Äôm in law enforcement in NYC and have significant knowledge and experience in this exact topic. It‚Äôs not the DA‚Äôs, ADAs and judges so much as it is the legislature, which enacted a trio of laws recently, that are making it extremely difficult to effectively prosecute criminals and keep the community safe.

1. ‚ÄúRaise the Age‚Äù brought the age of criminal liability from 16 to 18, pushing the majority of 16 and 17 year old criminals into the juvenile delinquency system. Those matters are prosecuted by the City prosecutors in Family Court, rather than by ADAs in Criminal Court and they are not exposed to adult sentencing and there is no bail. Since plenty of violent crime in the City is committed by 16 and 17 year olds, this had pretty obvious negative effects. It‚Äôs not to say the prosecutors and judges aren‚Äôt trying, but the legislature tied their hands.

2. Bail reform. The Legislature made it difficult or impossible to set bail on criminal defendants in most cases. This allows criminal defendants to offend and reoffend without being held on bail. Trust me, the judges and ADAs don‚Äôt like it any more than you do. But again, the legislature‚Ä¶.

3. The new discovery law. Prosecutors need to disclose certain material to the defense within a certain amount of time under NY and Constitutional law. That‚Äôs been the rule forever and it‚Äôs been doable. However, In 2020, the Legislature significantly increased that timeframe to an impossibly fast one that causes lots of cases to be dismissed because ADAs just cannot keep up. This also caused a huge amount of attrition in all the prosecutors‚Äô offices because the job became essentially impossibly and pointless to many attorneys. They left for less stressful and higher paid work in the private sector. There has been a lot of press on that point recently in NYC.

I hope that gives you guys some honest context of the reality here in NYC."
"Judges and prosecutors have judicial and prosecutorial immunity. It's far more absolute than the qualified immunity that leftists complain about cops having. A prosecutor can knowingly and maliciously withhold evidence to get a wrongful conviction and not be held personally liable.

It's a system that only works if all judges and prosecutors are moral and righteous people. But this country has such a shortage or moral and righteous people these days."
Do you include politicians in that group?
"The liberals here who infiltrated the 'hood with gentrification, when told or asked about the high number of shooting crimes in their neighborhood will blithely say, ""Shooting can and do happen in every area of the city."" If you remind them you are talking about the HIGH NUMBER of shootings in their area, they either spin on their heel or start with the name calling."
I'm confused about the indictment having 34 counts. That's kind a lot. I therefore wonder if the grand jury addressed matters beyond Stormy Daniels.
"It‚Äôs important to remember that politicians are part of a club that we aren‚Äôt in. Everyone here, regardless of political affiliation, has way more in common with each other than they do with their elected officials. Politicians fuck around and get rich while pitting us against each other. Meanwhile, we‚Äôre just trying to work hard, keep a roof over our heads, bread on our tables and keep our children safe."
"> How many times have you screamed for prosecution of mostly peaceful protesters

The point of the ""mostly peaceful protesters"" meme is that it's sarcasm. Nobody is calling for prosecution of peaceful protestors, only of violent rioters who do things like firebomb buildings, throw molotov cocktails into police cars, organize mass lootings of businesses, throw bricks through windows, assault people with skateboards, etc."
Has 0 to do with the NYPD. Read my above comment if you care to learn the real cause.
The police don‚Äôt press charges. The DA does that.
"I love the blatant denial of reality on your part! 
Democratic job!"
we're all ignorant of something.
"Fair, but also it's the DA's who bring plea deals, decide what to charge, and how to go forward with various cases.  In addition when a defendant is out on a shitty bail, its the DA who can bring a motion to revoke bail.  I've had to argue bloody murder to try to get DA's to revoke bail on guys who were ignoring every condition of their bond, even to get it in front of a judge."
"To the Left, it's ok that prosecutors have fled the ADA department, because their goal is to fill those positions with unqualified diversity box checkers who will just act as puppets of their masters."
funny how Trump is now going to benefit from all these changes. I wonder if we'll see leftists complaining about them now
"Stay safe brother.  When the legislature and DA clearly hate law enforcement, I couldn‚Äôt be in your shoes."
">It‚Äôs not the DA‚Äôs, ADAs and judges so much as it is the legislature

* the public knows what kind of government they want, [and they should get it good and hard](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/h_l_mencken_163179)"
"These must be the good intentions that pave the road to Hell.

I'm not from New York, but I supported the idea behind those three laws. Why should a legal child be tried as a legal adult? Doesn't our bail system disproportionately target the lower classes? Why shouldn't the defense get material on a fast timetable?

[Then this happens.](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/05/nyregion/new-york-crime-stats.html)

At minimum, the laws need to be further tuned."

"Does the jury really choose the charges?  Or, is it DA Bragg?  If Bragg really piled on charged he could charge Pres. Trump with everything under the sun:  obstruction of justice, election fraud, jay walking, wearing slippers after 10am, having manboobs (actual NY laws).  And with that Manhattan jury, he could get a conviction."
"You‚Äôre correct. Police arrest someone, and there are ‚Äúarrest charges.‚Äù But the DA‚Äôs Office draws up the Criminal Complaint with the charges on it and, in felonies, they instruct the grand jury on which charges to consider. The charges the GJ votes for end up on the indictment."
"Yes and no. The new bail laws are what they are. An ADA cannot file a motion to revoke bail that was never allowed to be set in the first place. Also, the law requires the judges set three types of bail and there is a waiting period before bench warrants are set, etc. They really stacked the deck against the prosecutors.

You‚Äôre very right about the policy broad strokes the actual DA makes. For example, Mr. Bragg coming into the office and announcing immediately that his office was no longer going to prosecute misdemeanors, and the resulting negative impact on society ‚Ä¶. the blame is appropriate dropped at his doorstep on that one."
Maybe to some. But I‚Äôm a democrat and I find it ridiculous and dangerous.
I agree with you that republicans will benefit in the long term from the crime wave the democrats in Albany spurred on. People will get fed up and then things will swing to the other side of the spectrum.
Thank you üëçüèª
"You‚Äôve hit the nail on the head. Criminal procedure laws are delicate and require fine tuning and adjustment to progress with the times and remain fair and just. The trouble here is that the legislature responded in a large, brash fashion in enacting these laws in response to complaints and problems with the way things were and swung things way too far the other way."
Exactly correct.
"Correct.

Often misunderstood part of law."
"Jesus, your bail laws are more fucked than ours.

"Sure is. I didn‚Äôt initially realize how much the local prosecutors are responsible for protecting society and the actual law and order of a community. Police show up for the emergency, but the prosecutors are the ones who make the lasting substantive change that is required‚Ä¶. Or fail to do so, which has repercussions too."
"Yup! The NY Legislators basically set off ‚Äúthe purge.‚Äù I honestly cannot fathom how they did not see this coming. I have to conclude that they *knew* this crime wave would happen, but proceeded with these new laws anyway."
"His statement was vague and something to the effect of ‚Äúmy office will not prosecute many misdemeanors and non-violent offenses.‚Äù That would be like an airline pilot saying they will only do long international flights and not shorter local flights.

What actions are those? Voting for NY state republicans and working In law enforcement as a registered democrat?
"Keeping society safe is the first and most important job of a government. I vote for whoever seems most likely to do that job. I‚Äôve been a mixed ticket voter for years. It‚Äôs important to remember that all politicians are part of a club that we ain‚Äôt in. You and I have way more in common than either of us have with any particular elected official. That‚Äôs why we shouldn‚Äôt bicker with one another, but instead demand better of our leaders as a unified group of citizens.

"Ugh.

Not prosecuting public drug use, for example, leads to more open use of drugs. Now you have more used needles lying around and you get rid of the shame of drug use, a deterrent.

I would bet (and probably win this bet) that the people doing nonviolent offense are more likely to commit violent offense than the people not doing any offense whatsoever. Is property damage considered nonviolent, for example? At bare minimum, you need to arrest them, then fine them / have them fill their time with some employment. Employed people have less time to break the law (outside of bankers, corporate executives, legislators...)"
"because you agree with conservatives that the most important job of government is to protect its citizens, and yet you vote for the party that made ""defund the police"" a centerpiece of their platform. You vote for pro-Antifa nutjobs. You vote for the party that helped put Bragg in office.


After the last few years I'm stunned that a law enforcement officer would vote for any Democrat anywhere. Frankly, I question your judgement."

"Would you like to know some actual reasons why somebody (part of about half the voting population, in fact) might vote Democrat? I can give you some examples if you like."

"Yup. You have to register as something if you want to vote in primaries, so I registered democrat.

They lost me with all the book banning, medical decision legislation and other overly intrusive governance. But I don‚Äôt agree with the democrats‚Äô strategies when it comes to crime prevention. So, I often will vote Republican in state and local elections and democrat in national ones. Believe me when I say I‚Äôm not satisfied with any of the choices these days."
Wasn't talking about absentee ballots. Get a clue. We have states that primarily vote by mail. Turn fox off sometimes and educate yourself

It's quite telling that parents [aren't allowed to read passages of these books in school board meetings](https://news.yahoo.com/speaker-kicked-florida-school-board-013558337.html), but those same boards insist that same book is appropriate for a classroom. ü§î"

If it's some sort of healthcare class, and the topic of the day is discussing rape, someone whose been brutally raped or suffered sexual abuse as a child might appreciate stepping out for that part of the class with a little heads up. 

Over the top trigger warnings for any little thing are obviously problematic, but for those who have suffered awful experiences in their past, a courteous heads up shouldn't be a controversial thing."
"The problem is that there is no evidence that these sorts of trigger warnings do any good for people with trauma. Triggers are complex and highly personalized, and almost never if ever as simple as ""discussing subject matter related to a trauma in a classroom is triggering"". Actual triggers can be things like sights, sounds, or smells that are associated with the trauma, often in non-obvious ways.

So veterans may be triggered by the sound and smell of fireworks, which trigger traumatic memories of combat due to their similarity to gunfire. But they are unlikely to be triggered by a classroom discussion of war."

This has been going on for years in academia. It's awful.
Yes we should have
"  I mean, those of us who care, do. I have a neighbor who is a combat vet and is a typical guy, except that he requests of all of us that we not light off fireworks except on the 4th when he  goes away and stays on his boat for peace and quiet and he asks that we avoid any sort of sudden, loud noises because they give him miserable panic attacks. The man suffers from PTSD and asks for reasonable accommodations, I see not reason not to respect that. I have a pretty dark sense of humor, but I keep it to myself and the people I know will not be offended by it. I don‚Äôt walk around telling dead baby jokes to random people who may in fact be suffering in the wake of having lost a child. If I were going to in a mixed audience, I would warn people first. That‚Äôs not me being a leftist, that‚Äôs me trying to be a decent man."
"Maybe don‚Äôt put a wall of speakers outside your house and blast brutal war movies when your neighbor is a combat vet. 

That‚Äôs less something needing a trigger warning and more straight up psychological warfare, though. 

The equivalent to something needing a trigger warning would be talking about a war movie you saw within earshot of a combat vet (not even directly speaking to them). Which, I don‚Äôt think, anyone would actually suggest a trigger warning would be required before."
American cheese only.  They don't get a good kind for this whining.
What about racist math?
‚ÄúIV League.‚Äù üòπ
"Oh, people will make it just fine.  We like to screw too much for people to end.  The constitutional republic of the United States of America, however?  No, I believe we are in our twilight years.  If these people are any indicator of what the 'leaders' of the future will be, we are finished."
"If words are violence, and you can respond to violence with violence, you are justified in responding to words with physical violence. 

It‚Äôs an insane justification for physically attacking someone who says something you don‚Äôt like."
"Completely agree with you, a simple warning before showing graphic content in a class seems like a reasonable and courteous decision"
"I don‚Äôt know who you think ‚Äúthey‚Äù are, but just to be clear, it was a couple conservative parents who clutched their pearls about David"
You'll probably be shocked to know the people who removed the principal for it were republicans using DeSantis' law.
It was conservatives that got so triggered over this that someone even got fired over it I believe.
"[Its literally a study in the Clinical Psychological Science, you cabbage](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/trigger-warnings-fail-to-help.html). YOU chill out."
People who launch fireworks are dicks to their neighbors dogs even if there are no combat vets in the neighborhood.
The really cheap stuff too.  Like dollar store.
Their credentials are pretty much on IVs at this point :P
lol
"For sure, yeah. 

The big question is: who gets to decide what constitutes ""graphic content""? Do we leave it up to individual professors to exercise common sense? Or does it need to be regulated at a higher level of management within the university?

Obviously war footage and discussion of rape are sensitive topics, and deserve Consideration. That much should be obvious. But who knows who might get triggered by what. For example... .. Oh, I dunno... People having a ham sandwich? (eating meat). Some people get triggered by that. Do we provide trigger warnings for that? I posit that's absurd. But who am I to say? I'm just some jackass on reddit.

People would have you believe that the choice is binary: either let profs exercise common sense, or we delegate the decision to management. Frankly, I'm more middle-of-the-road: I suggest having the university publish a blanket guidance (a policy that's unenforceabable) *suggesting* that as a best-practicd certain content be prefaced with a content warning. List the sorts of content that some people might be troubled by, the reason why it's best practice to provide a content warning, and publish it in an annual issue of guidance to all university teaching staff - then let them decide in their own classrooms how to conduct things. If someone gets butt hurt, it then becomes an issue between the student and the professor."
"Exactly. I think OP was making a tongue in cheek comment to this sub audience (I came to do the same, but OP beat me to it!)"
"Well the principle wasn‚Äôt fired because of that but yes, it was conservative parents concerned about a lack of transparency that complained"
This is leftist disinformation. The principal at that school already went on the record stating the firing had nothing to do with the statue. The statue nonsense was caused by one lone nutjob parent who complained. No sane conservative is against the study of art. All sane people are against teaching 8 year olds about anal sex.
"Shameful, my eyes could not possibly roll further back"
That‚Äôs a singular study how can I even tell if it‚Äôs peer reviewed?
"Yes. The world press went crazy last week over a school sending out notification slips about the students seeing David in class - something they did last year, and the school has no issue showing it, they just believe parents should be informed.

And the school, administration, and parents were vilified as backward hicks.

Yet these children expect to be notified of anything ‚Äútraumatic‚Äù??? Where is the global mocking?"
don't worry. this is going to be the leftist talking point for the next 10 years
"How do you *usually* tell when the numerous studies that must cross your desk per day are peer reviewed?

edit; Oh. I see. Post History more recent than my comment. Big Shocker: You don't actually give a shit if its peer reviewed; you're literally just the exact kindof dumbshit I described in the first place."
Oh maybe we are on opposite sides of this debate: The global outrage was because a principal was fired over it. This is egregiously wrong to me.
Low energy Jeb is defending Trump. Wow
"First Pence, now Jeb.

Damn. I guess Bragg actually found a way to re-unite the whole GOP."
He just wants another Trump low-five üòÇ
You don't have to like The Donald to recognize how destructive this kind of move is.
I think conservatives/conservative lights like mittens or jeb bush are more likely to to believe in the Constitution and understand the implications better of what this means.  I‚Äôve tried talking to some life long friends who are liberal and seeing if I can get them to understand how bad this is for us as a nation and it goes right over their heads.  Liberals are so blinded by their dislike of trump they can‚Äôt see the forest through the trees.
2016 election really was the best election in American history‚Äîfor so many reasons.
¬°Jeb!
"Polling shows the vast majority of Americans think this indictment is political. Even half of all Democrats think that. It's pretty safe to be against it, from a political stand point."
Please clap
Has to protect big brother from getting indicted for his countless war crimes
"Of course he did. He knows how energizing being indicted is for Trump, which he hates."
"Uh oh, Jeb is sticking up for Trump now. So Trump is now part of the establishment, a sellout, and no longer can call himself a leader of Conservatism. 

That is how it works right?  I mean, this is what the Trump supporters were literally just saying about DeSantis."
Who
It's an easy call. You don't just follow the law to a novel legal theory. This is the product of a desire to bring a case.
"Whats destructive about it. Ex-presidents shouldn‚Äôt be above the law. If he‚Äôs done something illegal, he should have the book thrown at him no?"
"Trump Derangement Syndrome. It‚Äôs real, I don‚Äôt like the guy at times, but I thought his foreign policy was solid, but it doesn‚Äôt take a brainiac to see that this will start a whole new wave of problems, each president now better be squeaky clean or else this happens"
It was the most entertaining for sure.
"I am apologizing for comparing Elizabeth Warren to Pocahontas and native americans nationwide. 

So you are conceding it was offensive to Senator Warren? 

No. I‚Äôm apologizing to the Native American people, who are a proud culture with significant contributions to the United States, for comparing them to Senator Warren. 

Air horn."
I‚Äôm a world where laws are applied equally that would be true. This is not that world. They‚Äôve been trying to get him since the moment he entered office. This is political and nothing more.
"Nothing wrong with holding them accountable, but when you are selective in who you hold accountable and have to manipulate charges in order to get what you want it becomes a problem."
"It‚Äôs a shit spot to be in though.

I‚Äôm really interested in what comes out Tuesday. Will this be a contrived case that‚Äôs obviously getting thrown out or is there actually some real meat here.

Ideally, all laws are applied equally to every person. Guilty or not that‚Äôs not been happening here with Trump for a long time. It‚Äôs ridiculously malicious and honestly criminally malicious in my opinion. At some point in time, running with trying to get *anything* to stick needs to get punished. It happens to ordinary citizens too when police go ‚ÄúI know they did it, I just have to prove it‚Äù and create their own imaginary world which can‚Äôt be broken even when direct evidence exonerating an unjustly imprisoned citizen is found. They ‚Äúknow they did it‚Äù and rejects reality.

We are at a point where as dislikable as Trump is - the scrutiny on him has made him possibly one of the cleaner politicians around today‚Ä¶ if they‚Äôve genuinely found nothing that sticks (instead of evidence of crimes that implicate people they don‚Äôt want implicated). The inquisition itself is evidence there.

This is really guilty until proven innocent and it needs to stop. For all citizens."

"*Kinda*. There are some instances where conservative Christianity crosses into authoritarianism, limiting what people are allowed to do based on gray-area morals."
This is how I feel talking to liberals about trans people.
"Exactly right. These crazy people have even started the narrative that if you don't completely agree with them and every thing that they want to do to themselves, then somehow you are literally threatening their existence. Just because someone disagrees with your world viewpoint doesn't mean that there is any literal threat on your life."
Exactly correct.
Admins shadowban people who do a wrongthink.
In the US? I'd be interested in the examples
I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs so hateful about getting someone the resources they need so that they DO feel comfortable in the body they were born in? Rather than involving permanent surgery?
You're not wrong.
"This isn't a not shadow ban thing. That can happen occasionally, but do you see the tag up there? Certain threads are marked ""flaired users only."" The mods will come in a approve unflaired comments, but for the most part unflaired users that comment in these threads are just here to spam leftist shit and make the sub unusable like the Joe Rogan and Jordan Peterson subs."

"A leftist friend of mine described it as, ""what's easier: change the mind to fit the body, or change the body to fit the mind?""

That helped me put into perspective, and be more empathetic to, the dilemma that those with gender dysphoria face.

However, just because someone is deluded doesn't mean society needs to bend over backwards to accommodate that delusion. They are free to think and feel what they want, but that doesn't mean I'm a bad person if I don't go along with it."
Or say grossly offensive/racist/sexist/etc. things on burner accounts to try to get the sub banned.
I know why it happens. It stinks that it has to.
"I'm on the side of ""do what you want"" I draw the line at ""use my pronouns (usually,) pay for my surgery, transition the children, and remove children from their parents that don't affirm them."
It's an artifact of reddits ui.  I'm a big fan of it but it's too easy to brigade and just drown out the opinions on here.
I can remember having to get a permission slip signed by my parents before going on a field trip. I wonder how many parents would sign one to allow their kids to go to a drag show at school.
"Funny the different ways these headlines get written.  The he judge said it‚Äôs too vague, and he might be right.  There was concern this would get a live action Mrs doubtfire in trouble (just as an example).

I haven‚Äôt read it, so I don‚Äôt know, but overly vague laws generally aren‚Äôt good"
"""vague and overly-broad"" 

So when it‚Äôs Republican led legislation, it‚Äôs a bad thing, yet we are often stuck with Democrat led ""vague and overly-broad"" laws, especially when it comes to anti-2A"
"I don‚Äôt get it‚Ä¶when did our society flip upside down and fight to expose kids to sexually suggestive material?! The left thinks this is a war on trans‚Ä¶nah, we wouldn‚Äôt want strippers twerking in front of kids either. Strippers however, are not lining up to slide down the pole in front of kindergartners‚Ä¶it‚Äôs only the sick fucks on the left who are literally salivating to mainstream chicks with dicks dancing near kids‚Ä¶of all of the hills to die on‚Ä¶why is this the fight they want to engage?"
Sick fucks
Literally capitulation to terrorism.
"Does anyone even ask if this is what kids want to see? Frankly, I don't understand the obsession with making little kids watch grown men gyrate in front of them. We hear about this crazy shit every week now. Just have the local librarian read something. Or someone to show up in a big bird outfit, pass out some juice or something, and then take a nap. Kids want bouncy castles. Not to watch your bub-bubs bounce."
Why are drag performers so hellbent in performing for kids? It‚Äôs an adult activity.
Wtf did Gen X do to their children so that those (now adult) parents think it‚Äôs a great idea to expose kids to sexualized entertainment??
"We should be asking ourselves **why** these people want to strip, wear thongs, dance on poles in front of children.   I'm not a fan of the books being read in drag story hour, but at least if they were reading winnie the pooh or some shit they could argue they are trying to get kids involved in reading and say they are normal people.  Dancing provocatively does not accomplish that.  If I as a man performed the exact same routine in a thong in front of children, I have to imagine all these loonies wouldn't be ok with it, but the moment I put on a wig, makeup, and fake tits it somehow becomes ok."
"I don‚Äôt get why republicans are so insistent on outright banning drag shows. What kids watch should be up to the parents, not the government. If they‚Äôre sexually explicit we should treat them like R-rated movies where adult supervision is required"
Garbage.
It‚Äôs hard to un-moor grown adults from their values and reality. That‚Äôs why they need to do this in front of your kids. Kids are easily suggestible and easy to confuse.
I need to understand how there is harm by not allowing drag shows in front of children. Are they going to lose their one and only chance to indoctrinate children?
"Interesting, so the terrorist act worked?"
"You have to be 18 to get into a strip club, how is this even an argument??"
Looking forward to having hooters having to ban kids
Apparently there is a judge in Tennessee that likes little kids....a lot
Ridiculous. Why do they want to preform in front of children so bad.
Lemme guess.. the judge ‚Äúparticipates‚Äù in a show from time to time..
Sounds like the judge realized he would be bored if he allowed the ban on his favorite form of entertainment. Where would he take the kids and grandkids now?)]
So disgusting. What kind of fucking world do we live in where this is okay. Early exposure to porn/this shit messes up children. Sex is not to be flaunted around like a new hat. Disgusting
Someone needs to investigate this judge for child abuse or possible pedophilia
"In 10 years, they're going to be like ""WHAT? WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO JACK OFF ON THESE KIDS FACES"" and theyre not even going to bat an eye."
"Utterly bizarre. 

Smells iike judicial activism to me."
Corrupt judges.
That picture is so perverse and disturbing... I just don't get the appeal. There are thousands of other things to crowd around and be entertained by.
"https://youtu.be/3PfsANvaueQ

Chris Beck, Navy Seal interview, who ‚Äúwas‚Äù transgender speaks on this drag ordeal and involving kids. He explains the issues about this perfectly!"
"The judge says that the ban violates the first amendment. 

By using this metric, wouldn't that make all gun laws violations of the second amendment?"
As a Tennessean I'm pretty bummed a judge blocked this.
Again why do they think Transgenders are a protected class?
Why do people watch or find this shit entertaining. I don‚Äôt get it
"I don‚Äôt understand this.  We as a society wouldn‚Äôt let our children go to a strip club, why would we let our children go to a drag show?  I don‚Äôt give a shit what consenting adults do, that‚Äôs not my place or my business.  But I draw the line at children."
"I'm all for not allowing kids to drag shows, but... what is the point of legislating it?

Like if you have parents that crazy, you really think this law will stop them from doing crazy shit to their kids? You can't just force parents to be good parents lol"
District Judge Thomas Parker is the culprit.
Ugh ! Really? Shut these shows down!!
"People credit McConnell with confirming a massive slate of to be appointed, but it's pretty obvious through headlines like these that a lot of those picks were garbage for the common man."
Pedo judges must be stopped
"I really don't understand why Democrats and the media (BIRM) are going so hard in the paint to expose kids to these weird pseudo-sexual performances. It's like some kind of teenage reaction of ""oh, Republicans are against this thing, so I'm going to be the most for it I possibly can be""."
Last chance to watch Mrs Doubtfire before this doomed law temporarily bucks the first amendment.
Folks here need to read the actual law as proposed. The judge was right. It's a first amendment nightmare and it's way too overreaching.
The fact this is blocked by a judge shows how completely effed we are as humanity. Flood it again Lord..flood it again
Why would this even be a question?
Exactly what is wrong with these degenerates?  Why can't we stop the pedophiles from hurting our children?
"You have to be 18-21 to go into strip clubs depending on the jurisdiction - drag shows are literally the same thing. They try to claim it isn‚Äôt, but it is a very sexualized performance. Idc the gender, children should not be subjected to ‚Äúshows‚Äù like these

Edit: If straight men/women did what drag performers & pride Parades did in public streets they would be arrested so quickly and would be labeled sex offenders. It‚Äôs so insane what they are able to get away with because of how they label it. Specifically in Atlanta during Pride Parades men are literally naked and whipping each other, giving each other blowjobs in public etc. But if you criticize it, you‚Äôre a bigot that should be cancelled. Also there are so many small children there with their parents - the parents should be arrested as well"
"Any grown man that wants an audience of children to ‚Äúperform‚Äù dress in sexually explicit clothing & ‚Äúdancing‚Äù provocatively isn‚Äôt right in the head. I‚Äôd have the same issue if it were my son with a female stripper ‚Äúperforming‚Äù in a thong. And yes that‚Äôs EXACTLY what they do

"Kids have to see men dressed in women‚Äôs clothes and wearing over the top amounts of makeup, how else are they going to learn.  Thankful for intelligent judges like this one."
"In many cases the parents are the ones wanting this, not the kids. We have terrible parenting practices that are leading to irreparable harm. Values and morales are thrown aside in the name of ‚Äúequity‚Äù"
I had to have a permission slip to attend the science fair- in the cafeteria‚Ä¶
Not many.
There was a carve out for artistic expression to prevent that.
We need to get the policies on the books. We can work out the nuances from the safe side.
"What is ""vague"" about doing a sexually charged performance featuring cross dressing in front of children? Seems really specific actually."
"Because this is being argued as a free speech issue, the law falls under strict scrutiny, the highest level of scrutiny. That means there has to be great compelling interest by the state and the law has to be narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. Basically asserting the law has to be the best solution. To me it appears the judge is saying that to achieve this governmental interest, the law is too vague and overly-broad. It is very difficult for laws to pass the strict scrutiny muster."
Vague laws are bad no matter who introduces them. Particularly when those laws restrict freedoms granted by the first amendment.
It's very telling that banning sexually explicit material shown to children is seen as an attack on trans people. Makes you think.
You mean how children are exposed to places like hooters and even child pageants? Yet I see nobody trying to ban those.
To be fair this article is intentional with its wording. The ban would ban all the shows regardless of if the venue is responsible and not letting kids show up
Where are all these trans shows kids are being exposed to?
"We passed the inflection point pretty recently IMO. This most recent big push left in the culture war has been the step too far for pretty much every intelligent millennial I know. I know because we're starting to talk about finding ourselves well to the right of this despite growing up as ""liberals"" during the Bush years. I got my poli sci degree back then, and i have people i studied with coming out of nowhere to talk about it all of a sudden, despite us not talking about politics in close to a decade."
This. You summed it up perfectly.A juggler not a jiggler.
"well they were raised by boomers, so....."
"You've clearly never been to a drag show. Hairy ass dudes aren't scooting their shit up a pole or showing any skin other than their arms and super maked-up faces. Thongs? Wtf? There's nothing sexual in drag shows. It's usually humor or music based. These are dudes pretending to be women. Any kind of ""exposure"" on their part would ruin the illusion. No one is showing their junk smashed behind a thong. There's zero nudity. 

I'm pretty sure a lot of people here are confusing drag shows with burlesque shows. Drag shows have been innocently existing for generations. Clutch pearls over something that matters."
"""I'd like to read a story to your kids, but only if I can wear a dress"". 

""No"""
"... Because a drag performance is not a strip club?

Thank you for coming to my TED Talk."
I have zero biblical knowledge.But I‚Äôm guessing we are close.
Trump appointed so who knows ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Slippery slope is real.
Trump appointed judge
"this was such a incredible interview.. as someone who moved here to the states in 91 and someone who always wanted to join the military here only to just never find the support from family and guilted out of it i am a big fan of military films/stories/people and lately there's such a wealth of resource available online now from former military people talking about their careers or famous battles/fights and i am soaking it all up. it never used to be like this where you had an abundance of operators willing to be open and talk about stuff so it's just so cool to finally hear from the actual dudes/ladies. 

there's stuff i don't agree with in some of the things said but i mean you can learn so much about that world from hearing those peeps talk and this specific interview was incredible. i watched all 6 hours of it. this country has had/has some bad ass warriors man and getting to hear from them now through these sit downs has been awesome."
Quite using logic as a counter argument!!
You could just‚Ä¶not take your kids to drag shows.
Then get trump to not appoint them
"Or... maybe the causation was in the opposite direction? Emotional distress due to dysphoria fueling an eating disorder? Just a thought.

I definitely don't know your niece, but that's quite a conclusion to jump to."
Found out a colleague has two trans children. What are the odds on that?
It‚Äôs no surprise when many leave parenting to the state.
"Its the parents job to raise their kids, not the government.  

Like it or not.  This works for both sides. Banning books or telling parents what they ""cant"" do is a nanny state."
"Send your kids to catholic school - and it won't be a problem.  Better education, and parents that aren't interested in that bullshit."
"Drag shows are basically strip club shows, they may not get fully naked but everything else is the same thing. It is insane that Dems/liberals are trying to say this should be mainstream ‚Äúentertainment‚Äù for our youth. Sick fucks. 

Full disclosure - I don‚Äôt necessarily give a shit if people wanna go to drag shows like people go to strip clubs. I don‚Äôt agree with it or understand why you would wanna watch that, but if you‚Äôre a grown ass adult it‚Äôs not my place to say you can‚Äôt spend your money on stuff like that. - but wtf how can you come to the decision it‚Äôs morally okay to show small children this shit in school etc.??"
"Parents have a right to raise their children how they want, with certain exceptions. This is not one of them."
Repression is harmful actually.
And what isn't vague about that?
"I‚Äôm a little confused. Whether you think they‚Äôre good art or not drag shows are, by definition, artistic expression. 

At least as much as any rendition of a live action Mrs. Doubtfire. 

How does the law draw that distinction?"
"Sounds like Obamacare: pass the bill first, you can read it later."
"Republicans: No sexual performances in front of children

Democrats: SO NO **DRAG**?"
"Might be they didn't specify the acts that count as ""sexually charged"". Though the reality is they don't need to and this judge is a shmuck. The very act is sexual."
Good thing this law isn't vague and committing sex acts in the presence of children isn't protected by the first amendment.
I've literally seen the videos just to be told every single time that each one is a one-off occurrence.
"It‚Äôs a person dancing provocatively isn‚Äôt it?? They may not be taking their clothes off but after seeing some of these clips of the drag shows parents are taking their kids to, I fail to see much of a difference."
Same difference. Drag has become a way of normalizing trasgender/lgbtq  ideology that goes far beyond how one identifies. This just happens to represent the side of the ideology that wants to get young children involved and people are starting to push back.
"Most judicial appointments that are given to presidents are recommendations from others. A president‚Äôs exact knowledge can be limited, because of these who knows what can fall through the cracks"
Well Trump made a bad choice in this case
"Given the fake ""born this way"" narrative? Non-existent. Given the obvious result of social conditioning? Pretty solid."
Zero. They‚Äôre like a trendy handbag for a certain type of liberal parent.
I guarantee that the younger sibling probably only did it because of the older one.
"JP was talking to another psychologist who commented they had a co-worker with a ""trans-child"" and a ""non-binary"" child.  The odds of that were in the range of 9 million to one that the reality is that the parent in this case was a narcissist."
"Report him to CPS first, ask questions later."
The odds would depends on the geographical location
"But isn't this law an example of the state trying to do the parenting? Not everyone agrees with each other's parenting style, but that doesn't mean the government should do it."
"Absolutely. Schools are a parental delegation. The schools should reflect the values and lessons the parents want. No school can have all books, and we all agree that some are inappropriate. No-one would agree that pornography or extreme violence, or even religious books, should be forced or totally acceptable upon young children of the general population. So there's a widespread understanding that there is a limit. Well that limit is determined by the parents who send their kids to the schools, and the limit is different for every community the school serves."
If only Catholic school was more affordable! I wish all dioceses would do what the Diocese of Wichita offers. No tuition for active parish families (they rely on donations).
Truth!  My 4th grade teacher put a guy in a cabinet because he wouldn‚Äôt play with the other boys at recess.  He only wanted to play with girls.  She also smacked my hand if I colored with my left hand.  They don‚Äôt put up with nonsense there.
"That depends entirely on what is being repressed.  Repressing at least some natural behavior and impulses is necessary in order to have a civil society.  You can see what happens, in say, San Francisco, when this breaks down.  Repressing the desire to commit violet acts is absolutely necessary.   Repressing children from eating all the candy they want and doing harmful things, like running out into a busy street is necessary.  I do not consider it repression to NOT expose young children to drag shows and other sexualized activities and material, even if you do."
Why are you defending the practice of grown men practicing their sexual fetish in front of kids often grinding their genitals inches from a kid's face? This used to be a very simple non-partisan issue: don't sexualize young kids. It is absurd that the left has championed behavior that should rightly get you thrown in jail.
"I would say, ""yes, no drag"" as it's an inherently sexual characture of the woman body.  They take all the accentuations of womens' sexuality and dial it up to an 11.

You want to talk about cross-dressing in front of children, that's one thing, but drag shows are, by definition, sexual."
"Yep, this judge is a dope. And from videos I've seen, these drag performances are almost always involving taking money from the audience, the same element every stripper literally employs in their shows. They're just trying to gaslight everyone. Drag is based in being sexually overt as the minimum standard to their performance."
I don't see how any drag show is non sexual. Drag is inherently sexual. It's the very definition of a sexual fetish.
"I've been to a zillion drag shows. Never once was there nudity. 

""Someone showed me highly inflammatory videos to convince me that something I've never experienced is terrible and it worked!""  Good for you. 

These have been around since your grandpa was a lad. Your not curious at all how this became a HUGE threat to our children.... All of a sudden.... Even though no children have been hurt by this ever? The Catholic Church spent 60 million dollars in 2018 defending child rapists they had been protecting for decades..... But THIS, this is the actual threat. Give me a break."
"I‚Äôve met a kid that decidedly presents as trans. I‚Äôm talking 2-3 years old. This wasn‚Äôt the parents influence - the toys and clothes they had tried were enough evidence for me that this wasn‚Äôt them pushing it on the child. After a year of a child psychologist, they enrolled him into a pre school as a girl, psychologist talking to the caretakers and everything. Not the richest family around so this would have been not cheap for them.

It‚Äôs actually really scary how parents not ready for this suffer too. Trying your best doesn‚Äôt work when you‚Äôre trying in completely the wrong direction for what the child is interested in! I hope they continue to stick to their guns of letting the child grow up naturally rather than letting their kid get put on hormones at 7-8 years old. The kid was 4 when it was first brought up ffs.

The parents pushing it on their kids and the people doing it for clout seriously frustrate me as the reality of it is not as easygoing as its made out to be. ‚ÄúAccepting‚Äù it and actually doing what‚Äôs right are two separate things and its serious stress for a new family! Is encouraging it better or is being neutral about it better or should you push for more masculine traits slowly over time?

Watching this from the side gave me an easy set of views on ‚Äúis this really the case or is this the parent‚Äù - is it being celebrated or is it seen as an insane challenge? I‚Äôm not denying anyone not loving their children but stressing about the right thing isn‚Äôt needed when its under your guidance."
This is no different than not allowing children to do any other adult activity.
"Yes, which is why they chose to attack basic morality first.  There's no agreed basis on morality anymore because being moral, apparently, is having religion ""shoved down throats"".  This judge's ruling is basically suggesting that banning drag shows at schools is infringing on someone's rights.  Question is....whose?"
"Which is fine for what they are!

I‚Äôm not against drag shows. Just against letting kids watch or be part of them."
"> Your not curious at all how this became a HUGE threat to our children.... All of a sudden....

I actually am curious why adults want to get their rocks off in front of children now.  My hypothesis is simple.  Because they feel emboldened by the left to keep pushing because the ""woke"" crowd is too scared to say anything and be cancelled.  

Have you seen the ""Desmond is amazing"" videos?  Do you also support female child beauty pageants?"
"There are boys that are more into more traditionally girly toys at some point in their development.  That doesn't mean they aren't a boy.  Psychologically, it may be important for boys to have a doll at some point as we the importance it does have to girls, kids discover how they interact through play.

The psychologists probably have these parents scared to death, all they have to do is utter the phrase ""better a trans kid than a dead kid"", for which there is absolutely no proof that refusing to allow transition causes suicidal ideation, and the parents decided to start calling their son a girl.

There are masculine girls.  There are feminine boys.  There always have been.  Are we now to subject them all to brutal regimens of psychological treatment, and systematic mutilation through ""surgery"" and pharmaceutical compounds they must take for the rest of their life?  That's insanity. 

Further, opposing obvious sophistry is to become a villain in the eyes of the establishment.  The US government is trying to make it illegal to not ""affirm gender"", which is to say that the US government is requiring bad psychological and medical be the norm."
"Growing up, my dad brought me to the bar with him because we couldn't afford a babysitter. Whether or not you approve isn't the point, but that he made a parental decision. Same with rated R movies.

I just think we gotta be careful about letting the government dictate how you parent."
Exactly. I lived in Chicago near Andersonville where drag bars were a staple of the neighborhood there. Never cared to go to one and couldn't have cared less what those performances were doing. But then they had to involve kids and that was the defining line in speaking up against this overreach. I now live in TN and commend the actions they've taken to go against this perversion.
"This reply smacks of concern trolling. You are literally arguing that a parent should be able to expose young kids to sexual material in spite of the evidence that this is literally harmful to them. Here is a link to one such paper.


https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/140/Supplement_2/S162/34185/Sexual-Media-and-Childhood-Well-being-and-Health


The state has a role in protecting children from basic harm such as sexual abuse, expose to drugs, and physical abuse."
Those laws already exist though. If a drag show is sexual and violates those laws then it should be reported like anything else. Making a new law that says all drag is sexual means people can be arrested based on what clothes they wear. New laws are not needed to keep kids away from sexual performances.
"Ah, yes, small government conservatives wanting the state involved if the welfare of children. It's worked so well"
That article talks about pornography. How many kids are getting STDs or pregnant from watching a drag show?
Drag isn't inherently sexual.
Drag is inherently sexual. It's different from crossdressing. That's why they are different terms.
"""If the welfare of children""? What does that even mean? 


It's clear that not only do you not care, you're one of the ones that wants to normalize exposing children to sexual material. I wonder why someone would want to do that in spite of the overwhelming evidence that it's psychologically damaging?"
Small government doesn't mean no government.   You're advocating for something more akin to an extreme libertarianism. Protecting kids from harmful influence is a classic example of conservative governance in action.
> Those damn conservatives won't let me rape my own children! Stay out of my bedroom! Quit trying to raise muh kids!
"Next time just say ""I can't tell the difference between federal and state government."""
You clearly didn't read the article. Pornography is only one aspect of sexual content cited.
I think you have it backwards. Crossdressing is sexual and is done in private or hidden under normal clothing. Drag is publicly crossdressing for performance purposes. Similar to cosplay. It is not inherently sexual.
"""In the wellfare...""
You're misinterpreting. Anyone who thinks it's okay to expose children to a drag show derserve to never be heard from again. I, however, know the state is the enemy and think the less theyre nvolved with our children the better. Stop asking them to fix problems cause all they do is make everything 10 times worse."
"Conservatives have utterly failed in ""protecting kids"", or they're complicit. Evil or incompetent, pick one"
"I've probably been to more drag shows than you and know this is gaslighting.

Further, Monty Python used to crossdress to comedic effect, as did Kids in the Hall. That was not sexual."
You kind of sound like an anarchist fyi.
"Remind me, which side is fine with abortion?"
"How is drag reading books in a library sexual? I'm not saying it can't be sexual, I'm saying it's not always sexual. There are plenty of instances where drag is not sexual. That's not gaslighting."
"I'm looking forward to the story time with strippers where they wear their little stripper outfits and read to kids. /S

Seriously, why is exposing kids to sexual performers and performance your hill to die on? Why do you feel this should be normalized?"
Have fun in fantasy world believing in a system that can't actually exist.
"That's not the hill I'm fighting on and you're obviously not even paying attention to the conversation. I said there are already laws against those things, why is there a need for new ones that are specific against the clothes a person wears? Like I said before, if the act is sexual then report them. If it's not sexual, let them be. 

The hill is the act should be targeted and not a group of people."
"Read the law. You look really ignorant right now and you are clearly the one not paying attention. 


https://www.capitol.tn.gov/Bills/113/Bill/SB0003.pdf"
It's funny you think that this type of thing is not already illegal.
Just admit you didn't read the law before commenting and move on. It's pretty clear you're embarrassed right now.

Men who fight against being depicted as toxic masculine steroetypes are not responsible for the actions of rapists and women hating serial killers."

"Leftism is fine, but radical leftism is not. All is good as long as they abide by the deontological principles that the rest of us do. The problem is that they are not doing that. Conservatives need to focus on three things: 


1) Not allowing the federal government to gain anymore power, regardless of how much of an emergency they claim we are facing. That also includes giving conservatives power that may or may not temporarily benefit our vision. It will eventually be used against us. 

2) Not allowing the government to add stricter regulations on firearms. Give an inch and they take a mile. It‚Äôs not likely that we‚Äôll get those guns back if their policies don‚Äôt achieve the desired result, and we will be left defenseless. 

3) Finding ways to stop funding a radical left-wing agenda in our educational system. We need to make sure that our young children are not being indoctrinated in school, and if the are, they need to be taken out of that school. We also need to divert public finding from DEI initiatives at universities. These universities can be considered ‚Äúpatient zero‚Äù for the radical ideologies that have taken our society by the throat."
Good point.  We are talking about the type of people who would try to change a dictionary definition just to help their argument.

I enjoy watching Bill Maher turn into my crotchety conservative uncle.
"Social Security is not socialism, i.e. an economic system wherein the workers co-own the means of production and share in the profits of the enterprise.  It‚Äôs a form of welfare to help folks too,old or physically unable to work.  Labeling the program as ‚ÄòSocialist‚Äô defames the single most popular program impacting US citizens."
Bill Maher is even seeing how radicalized the left has become.
Bill Maher supports every Democrat who doesn‚Äôt recognize the results of elections.  His go-to line here seems to be 100% in bad faith.
He's full of shit unless he pulls a Republican lever in 24....
"Maher is always so, so close to getting me to finally watch a Late Night^^TM show host, but then every 20 minutes he says something outlandishly stupid like ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt vote Democrat down ballot then you are a white supremacist‚Äù and it reminds me why I don‚Äôt watch any of these."

He does smoke a lot of pot.
"Ah, Bill Maher is now a conservative.  He may not claim the title, but his whole schtick is repackaging conservatism for a leftist audience.

"Yup, and that spectrum looks a lot like a circle that doesn't quite meet, or at the very least is not a straight line."

He must have been pretty high up in the SS being all of 15 years old at the end of WW2.
What are the Koch‚Äôs doing and how is it different?
"Fixed. Stooge almost has an air of him being unwitting or a victim in some sense, though.  Willing collaborator is more like it.  

His willingness to deprive others for his own benefit is a defining - and seemingly lifelong - character trait."
Wasn't he not eligible to join the SS because he was born in 1930 and you had to be at least 17 to join?
"Fourteen.  He hadn't hit 15 by the end of the war in Europe. But, no...no high ranking or promotion or medals or anything.  Just willing to confiscate property from other Jews at the behest of the SS.  You don't have to blindly trust me, you can [hear it from Soros himself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKUlz-C5BG8)."

Nothing triggers Bernie like pointing out he has three homes.
It‚Äôs about damn time the Pubs begin to call out all the hypocrisy.
He hit a nerve when he asked Bernie to be honest. That is absolutely not standard operating proceedure for Liberals.
Bernie Sander attacks all hardworking Americans just trying to make a living. He rather prefers distributing all resources like a communist.
"And that's the problems with a lot of Liberals these days. They only look at the bottom line of what these CEOs are making and are simply jealous of the wealth that they have. But they don't look at the fact that most of these people make that much because of the revenue that the company is bringing in under their leadership. If a company brings in millions of dollars, then the CEO should be compensated accordingly. And it is purely up to the company's leadership to say what compensation is appropriate for that position. It isn't up to the government, it isn't up to the public, or even the workers of the company.

There is absolutely no reason for anyone to dictate to a private company how much a CEO (or any position for that matter) makes or what their bonuses are.

I am proud to say that Mullin actually represents me in Congress. Unfortunately I can't say the same about the other Senator from my State of Oklahoma."
"That‚Äôs a crazy take. The entertainment industry and revenue generated from it have very little to do with creating jobs - that‚Äôs not the purpose of entertainment. On the other hand though, if you‚Äôre in the position of a CEO it is your responsibility to run your company in a way that makes money. That also creates jobs, but these jobs and companies are often exploring and extorting domestic people, and those over seas. Bernie‚Äôs take isn‚Äôt hypocritical. He made his money in office, honestly."
So you‚Äôd rather keep struggling and be prideful than just share?
What's wrong with Lankford?
I‚Äôd rather keep what I earn rather than let greedy people like Sanders steal it from me and pay their corrupt cronies with handouts.

Government sanctioned theft is not sharing.

You lefties can't tell the difference between theft and charity."
"Found the troll.

How about you be responsible for yourself. Nobody is stopping you from becoming a millionaire."
"I would rather be paid fairly for what I work for and then to actually keep what it is that I am paid for said work. There's no reason for me to give my hard-earned compensation to others who do less work than I do simply because the government or someone else tells me that it is the nice thing to do. If I make a choice to be charitable, that is my own prerogative. But there's no reason at all to force someone to do that."

Tell that to my university. I had to drive around for 30 mins looking for a spot in one of the lots. I finally gave up and parked in one of the shuttle lots.
Tell a truck driver trying to find a spot to park his truck for the night that there's too much parking and let me know how that goes for you.
Can we not waste time posting stories that were posted on a Sunday by some intern probably?
What it comes down to is that parking minimums are  heavy-handed government regulations that increase housing prices. It should be up to the free market to allocate an appropriate amount of parking spaces.
"We could invest in having actual trams and other public transportation, like other nations. I guess traffic is too important of an American tradition"
"Leftists absolutely hate cars, I'm convinced one of the main reasons isn't environmental, it's because they hate the freedom of choosing where you go when you want to go, they want you to be forced on a bus or train full of smelly homeless people that only goes where they want you to go."
"No thanks, the public transportation near me has constant robberies, assaults, and crazy homeless people urinating in it."
We don‚Äôt need cities anymore. That‚Äôs what we should *really* be talking about.
"Well, it really depends on where you are. If you‚Äôre in NYC or Chicago, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to own a car. Public transit there makes economic sense (I‚Äôm not even talking about the environment here). If you‚Äôre in a suburb that has like one bus every hour and then you have to walk a mile to even get to the bus stop, then of course you need a car.      

One‚Äôs decision of using a car or a train to go to work is independent of whether one‚Äôs a leftist or not. It does depend on where one lives though."
"You're completely ignoring the issue of safety, I dare anyone to ride Chicago public transit at night and then say its safe."
"Yeah it ain‚Äôt, but just like you‚Äôre likely to get mugged while waiting for your train, you could also get carjacked as you walk into a parking lot at night.    

Chicago is unsafe but that doesn‚Äôt mean the concept of public transit in a high population density city sucks. In New York City, London, Paris, Mumbai, Shanghai, Madrid etc we have a million plus commuters who want to leave their homes and go a few miles away to their offices. If they all drove their own cars, it won‚Äôt make sense. Again, ignore the environmental impact but what about congestion on the road? You‚Äôd spend hours in standstill traffic.    

Public transit makes sense where it is needed. Chicago is a poorly governed city of late but that is a reflection on the DAs, the mayor, the justice system etc, not on the concept of public transit.     

Of course, similarly, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to spend money on building train tracks for commuter transit in rural Pennsylvania for the tiny population that wants to go from point A to point B daily. They can drive."

Is the suggestion that the federal government should provide this security?  Then I‚Äôd say no
I don‚Äôt understand why this hasn‚Äôt been done long ago‚Ä¶ oh wait it‚Äôs an actual solution that‚Äôs why.
"Hey, why not every school? Have a vet stand guard. Have them go through a background and mental health check before and have them act as an extra SRO"
"My church has armed guards and a uniformed officer on site on Sundays.  Our local public school has single-point entry w/ reinforced glass doors.  I wish the school had an armed resource officer.

Armed security and basic building security is actually quite attainable.  The schools front doors look very similar to regular glass doors.  They're slightly heavier and always want to latch closed on their own.  But I guess they can resist sustained rifle fire for a few minutes.  The school has two sets, doubling the protection.  Our town police department has dedicated patrol for the schools during their hours, and I guess their typical response time is like 90 to 120 seconds.

I feel like that needs to be the benchmark.
1. Single-point entry w/ all other doors securely locked during school hours.  
2. All doors capable of resisting rifle fire for a few minutes.
3. Armed resource officers, or at least dedicated police less than two minutes away.
4. Video monitored, dedicated security controlling access during school hours.

I'm open to other suggestions.  The above security hardly makes schools into ""prisons""."
I agree.  Private schools should be able to secure themselves as they seem fit.  Government to be honest shouldn‚Äôt even set guidelines as that will just give an excuse to govern them.
"Optics. Generally you want to send your kids to places that don't need security. 

Security guards increase perception of the lack of safety, for parents and kids alike."
"That makes no sense. Why would someone not want their kid to go to somewhere secure? This just proves my point, no one wants an actual solution because anyone with a functioning brain knows banning specific guns won‚Äôt do shit to fix the problem. And now we got people worried about ‚Äúoptics‚Äù of simply adding extra security. So the cycle of shooting occurs -> blame the other side -> do nothing until next shooting will repeat endlessly."
Well that‚Äôs the difference between feeling safe and being safe
"They do want their kid to go somewhere secure. A security guard says ""not secure"" to them. A security guard says ""bad enough shit has happened here before"". It's a psychological thing. And let's face it, police and security guards don't have a great reputation in many places in the U.S. right now, either. School shootings have also occurred despite security guards being present.

While it's possible they would make schools more secure overall, the optics make the politics an obstacle. That's why it hasn't been done(on a broader scale). If it gets done successfully at a school that could help, but the problem is success is pretty much invisible until a security guard happens to stop a potential school shooter."
"His record was good until march 2020? See, I don‚Äôt necessarily disagree or agree, but these articles are absurd. There‚Äôs no primary happening right now. Why so many can‚Äôt seem to see through what this is is startling. This is another team‚Äôs playbook."
Trump or DeSantis either is better than joe
That's a foolish thing to say at this point in the game. Don't do the other side's job for them. Or do you honestly think that the left will stop with Trump?
Bull-fucking-shit

"When you can't criticize your opponent to their face, you imply they're unelectable behind their back. 

True or not, if people buy it, it's a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Who would buy this for their child? This doesn't make any sense
The first thing to come out of my mouth was ‚Äúare you kidding me?‚Äù
"This has more to do with arrested development in adults than with kids.

Adults buy a lot more toys *for themselves* than they ever used to.  It's their adolescent brain making use of their adult financial resources.

Holy crap.
But they're not trying to get to kids. They're just living their authentic lives guys.

You answered your own question.
Nobody here is saying they shouldn‚Äôt be *allowed* to do it. Rather how fucked up it is that a company is trying to sexualize teddy bears meant for children.
"There is nothing wrong to have toys as an adult. Its not only your money, but why turn towards a boring life once you grow up? I am having a blast painting and assembling miniatures like when I was a child and had legos. 

True maturity is when you stop trying to be cool as a teenager acting all grown up and just accept your inner child. Besides, war doesn't make you more mature, it just gives you ptsd, life-altering injuries and/or death mote often than not."
"This is so true. I'm a member of the Build a Bear sub, silly me joining thinking it would be a good source for release announcements and deals. The sub is brimming with leftie snowflakes. Demi-children who are upset they can't take their ""emotional support bear"" to work. Narcissists who post weekly pictures of their bear out on adventures. Wondering how to ""bond"" with a third bear without neglecting the first two, and downvoting the incredulous parent who tries to remind them we're talking about stuffed animals here. Worst, modifying their rainbow teddys to add top scars, even though the bear never had a gender or breasts to remove! It's quite disheartening."
Acceptance is the first stage.  We are well past this now

If you take your kid on their birthday you get a discount on a special birthday bear so its not so bad. But its a definitely a once a year thing
It's sexual and also it mocks and degrades women.
Taking your kids to either of those restaurants is just sad divorced dad territory.  You're failing your children big time if you are taking to a drag show or Twin Peaks.
"Beauty pageants, Hooters, drag shows, strip clubs, and the like are all things that harm your soul, child or adult. I would pity any child whose parents are normalizing any type of sexual proclivity. I feel so sad for those whose lives and goals are wrapped up in sex. There's so much more to life and that temporary high fades fast."
"Who the hell takes their kids to Hooters? Also, obvious logical fallacy is obvious."
"The problem is the question of where the line is drawn. It probably should be drawn somewhere. Letting people in public wear or not wear whatever they want is not a good idea.

On the otherhand going to other extreme and mandating amish plainclothes for everyone is also not a good idea.

I personally would support a more strict dress code for events and businesses that are open to children. And open to anyone for that matter."
"I‚Äôm curious how do y‚Äôall coordinate.

Is there a sub for brigadier losers somewhere where you all band together before coming to this sub or is it just random that all of you pop in at the same time."
We were laughing AT Robin Williams because dressing in drag was the joke.

"Crossdressing isn‚Äôt drag, and also part of the comedy of that movie is the absurdity of a man dressing up like that."
I‚Äôm sure your attitude would be equivalent for a MAGA bear.
"The bear itself doesn‚Äôt have breasts, if that dress construction is anything to go by. Looks like they‚Äôre sculpted by the tight belting of the dress, which is the easier and cheaper way to do it.  Look at the pinched way the waist pulls in.  That‚Äôs not sewn, that‚Äôs held by tension. I‚Äôm guessing the body of the bear is close to standard model, because sculpting 3d breasts isn‚Äôt a thing a company would do if there was a cheaper alternative.

Also, it can‚Äôt be coincidence that that wig is in the perfect style to get easily messed up.  Make those parents replace it more frequently if the kid gets attached."
You mean the anthropomorphic female bear wearing a dress?
"Are barbie dolls bears? Well, maybe modern ones are lol.


""bears don‚Äôt wear dresses and wigs or have breasts"""
I know someone from that cult. The children were most definitely sexually abused.
I'm on board with not allowing that either. Stop. Sexualizing. Children.
I hope you realize everyone hates child beauty pageants except for the moms that stick their daughters up there. If you're relying on support of them to defend mixing drag and children it's going to backfire spectacularly.
"What do you not understand about ""essential"" and ""consent""?"
"Do you think children should participate in beauty pageants? If not, why do you think they should participate in drag?"
"Dude, you're not making a valid counterargument. That's equally creepy shit."
This but unironically
"If you're looking for logic on this sub, you're far from home."
"No one does.  People don't actually boycott anything.  I could go through the houses of everyone who has virtue signaled 'China bad, must boycott'  and almost everything would still be from China.

No one actually lives the shit they say.  It's all posturing, all the time."
"You underestimate the power of little girls who love glitter.  It‚Äôs a teddy bear in a fancy dress, and possibly sold separately wig, and it will sell. Build a bears don‚Äôt even have a gender. They have whatever traits the kid chooses to buy in the wildly overpriced accessory section.  (My class wants to get a Converse wearing Jedi with lightsaber bear for a mascot.  This will not happen on a teacher‚Äôs salary, because my god are those accessories costly.)"
Lol you clearly miss the idea of drag which is freedom of expression yet your party tries to twist it into something it‚Äôs not hence why you‚Äôre losing elections. Drag race is innocent unlike Donald Trump
"Hey, I collect ceramic and plastic model horses, and have since I was a young child, so I see absolutely nothing wrong with hobbies that some would certainly consider childish, as long as you act as a responsible adult, which I'm sure you do."
How do you emotionally neglect a stuffed bear?
"Wow!  I admit that I collect ceramic and plastic horse figurines, but all of the stuff you mention is just so over the to,p I can hardly believe it.  And I've never met another collector who did any of that .  I hope my model horses aren't mad at me for neglecting them and not bonding with them or taking them on ""adventures""!"
Somebody made a conscious decision for it to look that way.

You are correct.  Miss Piggy is a pig.  Fozzie is a bear.
"I didn‚Äôt mean to imply they weren‚Äôt. I was making a distinction between the kids who were physically touched, versus others who were exposed to adult nudity because ‚Äúit‚Äôs natural!‚Äù, or were fully aware Mom and Dad had several lovers, etc. 

The latter is what reminds me of this world of drag bears, puberty blockers, and YouTube videos titled, ‚ÄúKids react to polyamory.‚Äù One could argue it is STILL sexual abuse. They make the same arguments the cult did."
I'm not sure how your comment relates to dressing little girls like adult women in drag and having them compete to be the prettiest. They aren't old enough to consent. I used to have to run pageants for an old job and it gave me the super icks watching parents sexualizing their kids. They even had age groups as young as a few months.
"Until we ramp up domestic production and become self sufficient again, I accept that technology, clothes, everyday things to live will 90% of the time be made in china. A necessary but unwanted evil. Except my furniture, that‚Äôs Swedish. I appreciate IKEA for that.

"Yep, not only that but the Sash under the neckline and shoulder strap is a bit tighter to make it LOOK like there is something there. A lot of nicer dresses have this to accentuate the natural curves on the female body, it just doesn‚Äôt work on men.

"Thank you for clarifying.  I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a very good example of an organization that would sexually abuse children on a technicality.  The sexual abuse and exploitation of children within that cult was extremely heinous.  Children were forced to use sex as a recruitment tool and were forced to have sex with many people starting at a very young age.  

I remember finding a letter from an ex-cult member who was upset about contracting an incurable STD after escaping the cult because she had managed to stay clean after all those years of having sex with different men in the cult.

"The left figured out they‚Äôre much better at censoring republicans than we are at censoring them. So if censorship is advantage Dems, why wouldn‚Äôt they use it? There are no morals and principles in politics, merely tools to gain votes and campaign finance."
"When the Left was for it before they weren't for it for principle, but as a means of acquiring power and hamstringing their opponents.  Postmodernism doesn't put a lot of value in Rules and Systems after all, and are a lot more The Ends Justify The Means.  And once power is acquired, do whatever is necessary to maintain it, which seems like a total reversal but is actually very in keeping with the philosophical underpinnings.

> ‚ÄúWhen I am Weaker Than You, I ask you for Freedom because that is according to your principles; when I am Stronger than you, I take away your Freedom Because that is according to my principles.‚Äù

> - Frank Herbert

Classical liberals (aka conservatives....well some conservatives) put a lot more value on Systems themselves and so grit their teeth and grumbled a lot but accepted the legal losses and tried to work out a compromise (for all the good that did them), leading to the slow march towards we see now.  Its a conflict between philosophies that view rules as a tool to an end vs viewing rules as the end themselves.

Also the old censorship wasn't monolithcally conservative as you were lead to believe, such as some of the leading voices against the violence in rap music in the 90s were......Tipper Gore and Hillary Clinton.  Joe Lieberman was one of the loudest gavel-thumpers about violent video games.  And Janet Reno rose to fame prosecuting the 'daycare satanists' in the 80s.  Historical revisionism is handy when you control the institutions of popular memory."
"Free speech is always more important to those with minority or dissenting opinions.  Right now the Left strongly controls public discourse and heavily push their preferred narratives.  They have the power right now.  Those in power always want to limit free speech.  If the shoe were on the other foot and the Right was controlling the narrative, the Left would be the ones valuing free speech.  That is why free speech is so important.  Because those in power always want to limit it."
Dunno; why do leftists keep shutting down those that disagree with them?
"Technically speaking, the political compass does a pretty good job of explaining; the vast majority of conservatives in Canada and the USA are quite libertarian (more freedom/less regulation, smaller government, liberty, freedom of thought/speech/expression, less censorship, etc) which has been quite prosperous, as opposed to the left which seems to be shifting more and more towards authoritarianism as they continue to try and *force* their beliefs upon other people and ultimately want to control you (example: Canada, my home and native land). This has led to nothing but failure as you‚Äôre giving way too much power to people who can‚Äôt be trusted with it. 

American conservatives seem to strongly value the Constitution that founded the nation and made it successful, and the Constitution was written by people that clearly had libertarian values (after all, they were trying to form their own nation and make it significantly different than Britain who they separated from.

The ‚Äúliberals‚Äù and ‚Äúleftists‚Äù are in the authoritarian-left category of the political compass whereas conservatives are in the libertarian-right.
I would estimate 90% of people fall into either the authoritarian-left or the libertarian-right, although I know several people who would fall into the libertarian-left category."
"I think there is always going to be pressure in a polite society to agree on speech that makes the majority comfortable and the left is pushing that in a big way, but in reality I haven‚Äôt seen anything from them opposing freedom of speech (ie the government punishing you for criticizing it). Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but we can all still criticize the government without them imprisoning us. 

Or is this to mean ‚Äúfreedom of speech‚Äù in a looser context like saying something people don‚Äôt like and being ‚Äòcancelled‚Äô as result?"
"because we're ""right"""
"Because when liberals decide that certain things are offensive to them, nobody is allowed to say them.

Then, if questioned, they'll use the emotional response:

""if you're so hurt you can't say it then it shows the kind of person you are"" .. 

Instead of giving a real and logical response."
I think the climate change narrative is what started this. They got the left to believe science is God and anyone who denies science should be censored
Because everything is considered hate speech
"It's likely because of the academic obsession with deconstructionism. In this worldview, everything, literally everything in society needs to be ""interrogated"" in light of what power structures it supports and undermines. That includes language and thought. There is now an enormous emotional and financial reward for ""problematizing"" everything."
"Because modern day liberals (aka leftists) do not want to be free. They want to be coddled from cradle to grave. They do not want leaders, they want rulers."
"When society generally leans to the Left, the Right wants the freedom to have an alternative voice. When society generally leans to the Right, the Left wants the freedom to have an alternative voice. People seem to want free speech protections when they need the protections."
The lefts entire socialist ideology is as useless and flawed  as sleepy joes  grey matter.  None of it will ever hold up to any kind of facts/ questions / reasoning . They have to silence anything that even remotely might poke a hole in it.  One of the method is demonizing it by pure association.
Both sides are ever more becoming anti free speech. Controlling people is a bipartisan issue.
I think folks on the right tend to value rugged individualism over collectivism.  It‚Äôs a hand and glove relationship with freedom of thought.
Because the Left are authoritarian totalitarians.
"It was not some sort of collective intentional decision, more of cultural shifts. Free speech also means different things to different left and different right

Oversimplifying a bunch of things in the mix for some degree of brevity, and I'll attempt some order but it won't be a neat timeline due to so many things overlapping -

* Libertarian right tends to think marketplace dynamics lead the best outcomes, and freedom of speech as analogous to a marketplace of ideas. 
* Socialist and progressive left does not consider marketplace dynamics conducive to generating the best outcomes. 
* Liberal left is closer to libertarians, but with more reservations.
* Left is generally more sensitive to speech purportedly demonizing minority groups, broadly considering more forms of speech harmful of this category.

--
* What kinds of contexts freedom of speech ought to apply to, and to what extent, is broadly disputed.
* Freedom to manage private associations depends on capacity of communities to police members speech, and reject members on basis of it.
* Anti-discrimination tends to conflict with freedom of association in many contexts, and certain kinds of speech can be a basis for discrimination.
* Religious right was considerably more interesting in censorship of certain forms of publicly available content.
* The left tended to include people who were inclined to express speech contents the religious right found objectionable.

--
* 80s happened, and the religiosity of the right declined significantly while libertarian ideologies mixed more with other forms of conservatism. 
* The internet happened, and political discourse began moving increasingly online, despite much of it being technically in private spaces it was effectively public.
* Online content was a gray area regards companies being responsible for content put on their sites by users, which would become a liability.
* Online content was generally not very regulated, and was curated more by algorithms than people, those algorithms favoring content that was provocative.
* Political vitriol was generally increasing in politics, online and off, and political advertisement and propaganda online expanded into many big forum spaces.

--
* Socialist and progressive left had begun to dominate youth culture more than ever before, which ended up influencing the way companies navigated this.
* A handful of major conservative figures had found ways to appeal to youth online, while facebook was relatively good in terms of reaching older people.
* MAGA events lead to a dramatic increase in scrutiny of online content and censorship, undermining to some extent conservative online movements.
* Generally speaking, more right wing political content producers ended up attracting negative attention, on top of fears of foreign propaganda growing.
* Big tech companies found themselves at the center of these political tensions and catching the attention of the government and public, siding with the left/youth.

--
* Younger generations were very frustrated with politics, with relatively little power over traditional political institutions.
* MeToo movement made one form of power youth had clear - to affect cultural instead of institutional change by assassinating people's character online.
* Freedom to not associate with the right, and the ability to affect politics by online movements becomes a key part of their toolkit.
* Younger left are now far less positive toward free speech, and view cancel culture more as consequence culture.
* The right is aware they're failing in terms of youth appeal, hence the culture war dynamics moving toward education issues as well as the internet.




All these dynamics and more contributed to changes in different right and left leaning groups of people over time. I don't think you can narrow it down to single factor, and if you lump all the right and all the left into two big camps they will each seem to have contradictory views, but they really each break down into several smaller camps, even beyond the bigger ones I mentioned."
"The left obtained cultural hegemony and political ubiquity. You don't tolerate potential dissent when your mentality is despotic and now dominant. 

Classic power dynamics."
Communists not in to free speech.
Liberals believe in principles until they get the power
"Because currently the left is in power, and dominates the establishment."
Because freedom of speech and freedom of opinion are individual rights and the left doesn‚Äôt believe in individuality. They believe in the collective.
"Seemed to start with ""hate speech isnt free speech"" and then just couldnt stop there.

Which is about how I expected it to go."
The left has gone too far left
It's not its considered a white privilege from my 1500 down votes from disagreeing.
I got banned from r/Republican for saying that Trump was not a true conservative‚Ä¶.
"When Right wing was establishment, Left wing wanted free speech  
When left wing is establishment, they want less free speech   
 

  
its just about power and a tool to maintain it, we as citizens should oppose anyone against free speech"
"The main thing is to understand that they have no principles, only goals"
"Because left wing people can't handle someone having an opinion in opposition to their own.

Case in point: it's not good enough that right wing people don't persecute lgqbullshit people ... you are expected to donate to their causes and sit through DEI ""training"" ...

I don't care what people do in their bedrooms.

As long as you're not diddling kids, if you are, then you deserve to be Darwined."
"They're only considered more of a right-wing thing to the right wing. As is the case with many terms in politics, the right and the left argue about the same term using different definitions.

The right lumps all issues related to ""I can't say X"" into free speech. This means they consider things like getting banned on social media or ""canceled"" by a business as things that have to do with free speech.

The left specifically refers to the constitutional right to free speech. If the \*government\* punishes you for your speech, that's a violation of free speech.

Both sides believe they are better for free speech. Both sides are probably right based on their definitions."
Well said
That reallybl sucks. I hope once conservatives get back in power we champion free speech as much as we do right now.
Well said and unfortunately true. We have become what they claimed they used to be.
Hmm. Well I know that politically benefits them now but why not stick to their principles? In the long run it'd help their case so it seems counter-intuitive to abadon it for short-term gain.
"Because they know better and can inform the rest of us what is good, beautiful, and true."
"Follow the Science - except for when it doesn‚Äôt fit the narrative (global warming didn‚Äôt work, so let‚Äôs call it climate change; science says fetus is a baby, so let‚Äôs proceed with it‚Äôs a ‚Äúwoman‚Äôs right to choose,‚Äù etc.)."
Damn. So it's basically just a cycle of whoever is making it worse? That stinks.
"This is just untrue. 

I don't know any American conservatives who have ever disagreed with Jean Paul Sartre at any time in history, ever."
"That's very strange they'd do that. Granted mods on political subs, at least from what I've seen, seem to apply their rules really weirdly."
"They abandon their principles for 2 reasons.  For leftists, the ends justify the means.  So, they will side with the ‚Äúenemy‚Äù and/or adopt any stance as long as it achieves an end goal.  The other reason is that they believe in moral relativism.  So, what is right for me is the right thing because that‚Äôs what I believe.  Likewise what is right to you is the right thing because you so believe it.  There is no true north for what is right and just, so anything goes.  That‚Äôs why they always argue that the constitution should be a living document and change with the times."
"We keep calling them liberals out of habit, but the truth is, there are no liberals left on the left, now the party is in the midst of a tug-of-war between Globalists and Marxists, both of which think speech should be governed."
">These are questions for ask a liberal.

Exactly.

Look at lefties like Rage Against the Machine, Howard Stern or any number of Hollywood types that have been outspoken in their leftist ideology.

Why are they all big-government suck-ups now? They were anti-establishment before."
"Simple. They don't hate big government at all. In fact they love big government. The only problem was that they didn't like that common sense was in charge. Now that the loonies who think reality will change to their desires and world will bend over backwards for their delusions, they love it."
"Because they weren't anti-establishment. They were anti-right. Now that their radical leftist ideology is in power, they abandon the facade of being anti-establishment."
"I'm just upset at the timing. I just paid another $45 to renew my permit. Had this been passed a month ago, it would have saved me that money."
It's called Constitutional Carry
The way it was meant to be!
I expect our intelligence agencies to organize a something-something with high casualties in Florida to try and make Desantis veto it.
"Luckily it‚Äôs only $45, and now you have a permit with awesome reciprocity!"
"Its not, because it lacks an open carry provision and also has several requirements that would not be present in a true constitutional carry law. 


Its permitless carry which is an improvement, but its not constitutional carry."
No its not
As we are all expected to pretend like additional regulation would have prevented it.
That's true. I do have to travel a bit for work. I didn't think about it that way. Glad that I have it for that!
This is why most people are still gonna get the license for concealed carry. Gives you reciprocity in 38 states.
Thanks for the info
"He needs to be a governor first if he wants to be a Reagan. Reagan led California for 8 years before pushing to become president.

He looks like he is fishing for a cabinet position right now."
I think he will be a good choice down the road.
"He seems like a good guy and a strong candidate. It‚Äôs easy to write him off, but it‚Äôs very early yet. Tbh, the R bench is pretty deep, which is a good sign."
Desantis first
This young man has so much potential.
I like the guy. Honestly he‚Äôs more of a threat than Desantis. I‚Äôm still Trump til proven otherwise but i‚Äôd say he‚Äôs a bigger threat to trump and people aren‚Äôt really talking about that. Curious how this plays out.
He is ideal VP candidate for Trump
I‚Äôm starting to like this guy ALOT
LOL
"I'll sit and wait on this one.

My first thought is there's probably a plot twist here, but I also feel like this guy might be working out of Obama's playbook being the non-white guy fighting against a powerhouse.

If by some unlikely scenario he wins the nomination I'd probably vote for him over Biden, but I feel like Desantis and Trump are the two main competitors, and the fact that Vivek is a Hindu is probably going to stir up the evangelical vote a bit while they probably wouldn't otherwise be concerned with him. Plus his biotech background is probably ripe for controversy.

That being said I do think an asian republican president would probably do really well if Trump retired from politics, especially if they can connect with a rural vote in a way that the democrats couldn't."

"No.

"Meh, his policy goals are decent but the man has absolutely no charisma"
"He also needs some public speaking lessons geared toward politics. Right now it feels like he's always preaching to a captive audience in a board room, not the public.

Overall though, I don't think he's offering much other than platitudes, not really impressed when I look into the guy beyond the PR stuff."
"Yeah.  While I don't think Presidents need to be lifetime politicians, I'd like some sort of government experience out of the leader of the most powerful country on the planet.  Its the hardest job there is.  Go be governor or even be in Congress for a term.  Something."
"I think he's a great choice now, I feel he has something to offer, that no one else can. He understands the source of the corruption goes beyond the deep state and in order to rein in the government, you first have to rein in the asset managers that own our congressmen. BlackRock alone has 2 trillion in assets, they have complete control over corporate America and DC. Vivek is a bright guy and it's going to take intelligence and determination to dismantle the corrupt bureaucracies that are harming America."
Got a quality list?
"I do like DeSantis, he's very likeable with a solid track record as Chief Executive; however, Ron would be my second choice after Vivek. I just feel like we're at a crucial time and there are deep problems that haven't been addressed and I feel like they're so deeply imbedded in our system, it's going to take a person like Vivek to correct them, because they're very complex issues. We have to not only save our Republic from these people, we have to save capitalism, because the left is corrupting it and weaponizing it against our conservative values."
No Thx. He is back by the Bush family. I like him where he‚Äôs at
"I know for many people, Vivek Ramaswamy is someone that just popped up, but for those of us that have followed him for years, first as an entrepreneur, then as an author, we know that he's a genuine guy and his crusade against the woke Left and the destructive ideology that's tearing our country apart, is very much a personal crusade for him. In my opinion he has unique qualifications that make him a very interesting candidate.

This Jordan Peterson interview is a [fantastic interview](https://youtu.be/JX9B5tnj-xI)

"People really need to question sources of people trying to sell books or trying to remain relevant. If someone says something that doesn't financially benefit them (as they take losses), then that is a sign of integrity.

"There is no connection to Soros, he received a scholarship when he was 25 from the Paul and Daisey Soros foundation, that's set up for the children of immigrants, there are no strings attached. 600 other Americans have received the same scholarship, it's one of the most prestigious scholarships in the US, it's merit based."
Imagine thinking someone in their 40s isn't ready to be president.
"Or maybe he just needs to get his message out... 

We already know his ideas are great, because Trump and DeSantis are both parroting every policy he has pushed."
"‚ÄúNobody named Barack Hussein Obama will ever be president of the United States!‚Äù

Loser."
"If he was running as a Democrat, it would help him. Check the most diversity boxes to win!"
"Oh really? Because he's very much an open book and those that have followed him and his career know very well what he represents and how this crusade against the Left started. Everything he's now talking about, he's been talking about for years, none of it just popped up, he's been preaching these ideas for some time now and many of his ideas have been parroted by both Trump and DeSantis. Also Vivek is starting a podcast to document and expose just how corrupt the whole process is."
"he would be a practical choice, but that's just not how american politics works (or doesn't work) right now, for better or worse"
"He is another Andrew Yang or Tulsi Gabbard.  The GOP machinery and insiders are not ready for a candidate like him.  That being said, they were not ready for Trump either so I maybe wrong"
"Understanding it doesn't mean he has the connections or allies to make it happen. Being president is not a one man job.

Our problems go much deeper than that. It is Academia. Until Republicans address the cultural rot that starts in schools, the rest of it are just symptoms of that problem."
"The three running, plus at least 3 governors (Abbot, Noem and Youngkin) plus Pompeo, heck I'd even through Kayleigh McEnany in the hat for a VP spot.

All are pretty strong, non-RINOs. All aren't f'ing crazy, like pretty much the entire D team looks right now."
"Good point. The thing is Desantis has actually put a lot of things into action which a lot of other people envy when associating their own politicians. We will see when election season comes along. What we need is a coherent front runner for once, left and right included, with real leadership qualities who can speak intelligently. Trump, Biden, Hillary were all just brainless mouthpieces."
And he's just as bad. He looses everytime there is pushback. It's all show.
"Because no one outside of the moderate right media sphere has ever heard of him or anything he‚Äôs ever done. To compare him to Regan, a movie star who was governor of California for 8 years is absurd."

Wokeness in general? What is his grand plan to stop it, really? Going after ESG corporations? They mostly DNGAF but are responding to cultural pressures that aren't going to be ended by technocratic changes.

There's a lot of grandiose promises but I'm not finding much concrete information that shows a path to achieving anything significant. His campaign site is remarkably barren of policy. 

Preaching the standard culture war stuff is not enough, the republican party's actual voters, despite their electoral college advantages, are in decline. Riling up a shrinking base with the same story with new actors isn't going to cut it for much longer."

"You're right about that, DeSantis has implemented some great policies and believe it or not, most of them originated with Vivek. If you've ever read ""Woke, inc"" or ""Nation of Victims"" you would see, Vivek was talking about this stuff long before it was on anyone else's radar.

Have a good evening!"
"This is the first time im hearing of him, Of course you can never write off someone from presidency. Knowing the clown world we live in steven segal is gonna be running for his third term in a couple decades."
"His books have sold over a million copies, so I think it's a bit naive to assume no one outside of the moderate right media sphere has heard of him. Just because you haven't heard of him, doesn't mean others haven't."
"Yeah, I thought that, but then when he didn't answer me it kind of confirmed it."
"When Vivek was 25 he won a scholarship that was funded by Paul Soros. Vivek literally has no connection with George Soros or his family.

Edit: additional details about the scholarship Vivek received.

The Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans is a merit-based scholarship program for immigrants and the children of immigrants who are pursuing graduate or professional degrees in the United States. The program was established in 2000 by Paul Soros, the brother of billionaire investor George Soros, and his wife Daisy Soros.

The Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans is one of the most prestigious scholarships in the United States.

My point is that I'm not seeing what tackling this at specifically the asset manager level is supposed to achieve.

But we have to affirm his identity! Right?
What is a woman
"I'm not here to talk about my transition, I'm here to kick some ass. Rebecca Swanson"
Based
This was objectively hilarious
"You guys should read the entire article. It gets pretty good. Especially when the previous record holder starts calling the new record holder a bigot, then proceeds to stick ‚Äúher‚Äù foot in ‚Äúher‚Äù mouth."
He beat out the current holder who was a 'trans women' (male who cant compete against real men) they send over the weakest biggest loser males to ruin womens fun bc they feel bad losing against fairer competition.
"I love this protest.

Also a friendly reminder that the Women‚Äôs US soccer team, the one who cried about being paid equally as the men, [lost to a group of male 13 year olds](https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/a-dallas-fc-under-15-boys-squad-beat-the-u-s-womens-national-team-in-a-scrimmage/)"
"Please stop being transphobes. That bearded male is clearly very feminine and sexy female. If you deny that he's a female, then you're a white supremacist."
So awesome - still sad it‚Äôs even allowed but glad he mocked the bs
I won't be happy until I see someone like this on Tampax commercials.
"If there are more than 2 genders, why do people with the new genders want to compete only in women's contests?"
"The funny part was the other person involved, the one who previously shattered the womans record complaining about the unfairness of it. 

And before anyone calls me some kind of bigot, the other person is a transwoman and was shitting on the other biological women in the competitions (basically shit talking and gloating). So she deserves what she gets.  In fact she went out of her way to say everyone calls her ""nice"", which is projection on a massive scale."
Gold
The left sure do hate women.
"LOL this is awesome. If this is what it takes to knock some sense into these morons, it needs to happen everywhere until they can't stand it anymore."
Haha would love to see the headlines of a woman entering a drag competition
"I seem to recall that most of my youth it was a running gag (see Top Secret) about the East German women‚Äôs Olympic team being tested to make sure they were really women. 

Note that absurd joke is our reality, except you aren‚Äôt allowed to test them anymore."
This guy is a hero in my eyes. Hopefully we have more men stand up to these fuckin losers messing up womens sports
It‚Äôs a shame that under the Democrats kids have to grow up questioning their biological sex because they are brainwashed to think there is no difference between the genders by their schools.
"This needs to happen with every sport. The only way to beat this is to fight absurdity with more absurdity to the point it leaves no option, but to admit that biologically born males have distinct physical differences and that they should be grouped based upon sex and not self-identified gender."
"I'm looking forward to when a 6'10"" guy who can get close to touching the top of the backboard joins the WNBA."
"That sexist bigot!   Oh, and I see he's white too?!   What a racist!!

But seriously, I'm so glad to see people showing the absurdity of these rules."
The best part about this is that he's been retired from competitive powerlifting for many years.  He's not anywhere near his former peak strength.
">He then casually bench-pressed nearly 370 pounds ‚Äî beating the current Alberta women‚Äôs record by almost 100 pounds.  
>  
>That record ‚Äî 275 pounds ‚Äî was held by trans athlete Anne Andres, who was seen watching Silverberg while volunteering at the event.

I just...   how can people see this and not get it?  What was the record before this uh... other individual?

Hell, **I've** bench pressed 275 pounds before and I'm not a trained athlete or anything."
This should be done all the time.
An inspiration to young girls all around the world!  üëèüèº
Believe all women.
Heather Swanson vibes
"Didn't zuby break a deadlift record identifying as a woman, too?"
I follow powerlifting.  Crickets in the community.
Good
"Well done, sir!  Well done!  Gave Andres a taste of his own medicine!"
This is fr like something out of south park ü§£
Hopefully this starts happening more and more until people on the left finally have to admit the ridiculousness of it.
I‚Äôm hoping my comment isn‚Äôt removed but this is awesome. I‚Äôm liberal but everyone I know on the left also agrees ignoring biological differences in sports is silly. This is a perfect example of how ignoring scientific reality doesn‚Äôt help anyone.
Stunning!!!!!
"Aaand that's another mark on the ""Events Predicted by South Park"" chart"
Good.  Beared person is more of a woman than that Andres person.
Yas kween!!
She's inspiring. So brave.

This is pathetic
We Truly live in a clown world.
Bravery comes in all shapes and sizes.
"Anytime a transgender is competing, all men should compete."
üéµStrong woman! Yeah strong woman! üé∂
What a brave and stunning woman üòâ
"This is fuckin gold.  Good for him (the bearded dude, not the dude who thinks he‚Äôs female)."
"While not personally conservative I agree this is ridiculous. Any consenting adult should be able to do whatever they want with their own body and be respected as a person but you can't deny biology. Trans woman are not the same as the  overwhelming majority of cis women. 

Sports should remain separate. If we want to be inclusive we can have a 3rd, non-gendered, category for trans or other gender non conforming athletes."
"The crossdresser dude whose record got broken is all like "" Nooo you can't just identify as woman, that doesn't make you a woman"" lololol the IRONY"
"I've heard some men self identify as women too in spain. Not trans. Not cutting of cocks or anything. He just realized women are privileged and self identify and set that up. Took 5 minutes.

Should we encourage this behavior?"
"The perfect woman, is a man.

Dr. House Md."
THIS is the BIGGEST problem our country and our society faces. We must stand TOGETHER and not allow the TRANSGENDERS to gain POWER in this country. They already have TOO MUCH say. We must BAN them from POISONING our children with their BLASPHEMY.
"When we originally had divisions for men and women, the concept of gender didn't exist. It was just a synonym for sex.

The intention was always 'male' and 'female' sports.

Now we accept that gender is a social construct and anyone can be a man, a woman, both, or neither.... And I don't even mind. Be you. Whatever.

But males shouldn't be competing against females."
"How about this - allow anyone to enter no matter their gender?  If women wanted real competition, they would compete against men."
"Yall just can't stop thinking about trans people, can you?"
"While I don't think trans women should be competing in female events (at least in serious competitions), I think the guy acted like a jerk. What he did was deny some women who had worked their tails off the chance to win so he could make his jerk statement. Kind of like how I remember seeing a jerk ""demonstrating"" for the NRA by displaying his guns as he walked around at a local fair because the fair's organizers didn't want guns around the event. And turning an event for the kids into his own personal political statement."
"I am a little curious about the antitrans people's opinion on this.

MTF signs up for a sport, but they are terrible at it. I'm talking benchwarmer at best. Is it the same level of ""bad""?

Also a question of if you have a female with a genetic condition where she built muscle as well as a man?

Supportive here, do what you love IMO. My complaint is more like when a middle school football team has a 6 footer and the opposing parents complain. (Edit page refreshed) Is it a general complaint about unfairness or just the idea that's abhorrent?"
"Obviously, he's doing this for clicks.

But, do people think this way? There is in no way I would feel threatened by a transgender person, why are people so scared of them?"
"‚ÄúThis is my rifle, this is my gun, this is for fighting, this is for fun.‚Äù"

its cheating and he proved it
All men should just identify as women take over.
"I'm a bleeding heart left-wing tree hugging communist antifa member, but you guys are right about this transgender athlete nonsense."
"And as more privileges and advantages are given to people on the basis of race and gender identity (competitive advantages, hiring preferences, university admissions preferences, reparations, gov't contracts) we should expect everyone to adopt those privileged identities in order to overcome the discrimination and the absurdity of irrational leftwing ideology."
He‚Äôs a hot chick
What an inspiring story about human hope üòÖüòÇ
I like that the trans identified man that held the woman‚Äôs record was there to watch him break his record.
"Wow good thing we don‚Äôt allow bearded males in women‚Äôs sports. What point was this again?
I‚Äôll take the downvotes now"
Strong woman!

*He* ... judgemental much... You think you can tell someone's gender by simply looking at xem?!!!!!       /s
But women can do whatever men can ü§™
"Xir beat this Chad Coach‚Äôs biologically female lifter (who held the record)

Chad said I‚Äôll just take that back then. FairPlay."
"It's simple. Men and women have different federations because sex has different physiological implications. You don't even have to enter the gender/sex debate because it's not a gender issue. Call it ""male"" and ""female"" federations if you have to.  

If someone wants to make transgender federations, that should be fine. I'd be open to letting transgender athletes compete if there are studies showing how long one must be on HRT for their physiological advantages to disappear and then you set a cutoff. I imagine it happens sooner or later, but I don't know.   

As far as inclusivity goes, either let them compete with men or let them perform next to women but DQ them from winning. Similar to auditing a class at college."

"Absolutely, why it's on r conservative like this has anything to do with politics is a bit weird though."
South Park was not satire. It was just spoiler alert.

It wouldn't even have to be LeBron. A no name NBA player could do it; that's how wide the gulf is.
Juwanna Mann is actually a movie about that. It was a comedy that released in 2002 lmao now look where we are.
They should identify by weight as well.
Who was also a man -> woman trans and held the previous record
It‚Äôs Canada. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the next 5 competitors are also trans.
No true transman?
"Yeah I was reading the article too and that quote stucked to me. Because it diverts from the point he is trying to make and hells just minimize the issue because he is a ""transphobic bigot"". Respect her gender and her personal decisions while also pointing the non sense in the sport. One does not negate the other."
No true Scotswoman...
The sad part is that the irony is completely lost on him.

"You mean ""her"" identity? Bigot"
"I, for one, say good for her. A power move like that really took some balls!   

The previous record holder should stop being a dick about the whole thing and congratulate the new champ."
"And all of you *straight* guys **have** to date him, too, else you are transohomophobigots.  Good luck being top with *this* guy..."
A biological female
You tell me
I'm gonna roll up the other ladies and smoke em'
Couldn‚Äôt have said it better myself.
This is why these people need their own sports division.
"That happens pretty often actually, national women‚Äôs teams always practice against boys under 17 and they lose most of the time. Those boys at least look like they‚Äôre in the top league (it goes rep > red > white) but when I was 14 my red league team crushed the Canadian women‚Äôs team 3-0. Even at 14 I remember noticing how much stronger and faster I was than them, I‚Äôm not even a big guy either at 5‚Äô9, yet I could *easily* force them off the ball."
"I absolutely couldn‚Äôt stand that purple haired cartoon character whining about ‚ÄúWe do the same work as the men but get paid less because we‚Äôre women‚Äù. 

You DONT do the same work as the men‚Äôs team. They play against adult males while y‚Äôall couldn‚Äôt beat juvenile males. 

I‚Äôd be fine with the USNWT making a way bigger amount‚Ä¶.if they generated a way bigger amount. 
But they don‚Äôt. And their contracts are for a percentage of revenue. 

Don‚Äôt like it? Sounds like you have a few options:
A) go find somewhere else to play you like better, if you can
B) try to renegotiate the contract to a number you like rather than based on percentage of revenue, if you can
C) STFU and take it up with the 50% of the global population that are the same gender as you and don‚Äôt even want to watch their own sex play soccer"
"If, as a man, you're not lusting after this stunning, brave woman, then you're a disgusting transphobe literal Nazi Hitler!!!"
It's a hate crime to not be attracted to her.  So pucker up buttercup
I wish my beard was as full as hers.
Agreed.  She was a very handsome women.

Actually the 275 record was from another trans woman
"Who cares, women are the ones who are most behind trans rights.  Oh boo hoo they have to deal with their consequences"
Don‚Äôt give them any ideas!  I already hear about how bad their menstrual cramps are. sheesh‚Ä¶
"There are trans males that do complete in men sports, who were assigned female at birth. They are also winning in some cases.

And since there are only women and men contests, they don't have much choice. How much of this did you already know but chose to ignore?"
They're projecting because they call other people nice?
Typical narcissist.
Nearly as much as they hate straight white males.
"Women do drag all the time, why would that be a headline?"
What test would you use?
Literally no one says there is no difference between the genders.

I hadn't realized that the shotput weights vary by gender. Yet genitalia doesn't have the same effect. Strange days indeed.
"Wow, very eye opening just how huge the difference between boys & women in sports is."
"Nothing gets by you. Only in 2023 would this need to be said. Bravo, good sir. I wonder how the radical feminists feel about these men destroying womens sports."
That meteor will be here any day now right?
"> Now we accept that gender is a social construct

No"
"No, we don‚Äôt accept that. The vast majority don‚Äôt accept it, why? Because it‚Äôs bullshit nonsense. Just no, all the way around. You are making shit up. Love you."
"That's called the ""men's"" division. Most ""men's"" divisions are in fact open to anyone but end up having exclusively male participants due to the level of competition."
Idk why you‚Äôre getting downvoted. I think an all inclusive weightlifting competition could be pretty interesting!!!! Survival of the fittest!
">How about this - allow anyone to enter no matter their gender?


As someone who has a majority of the women in their family that completes in women sports some at a high level. No to this all around, I don't want to see something I've watched people I love and care about have that stripped from them."

You sound like a transphobic. Gender is fluid. I can be a man during lunch and a woman during a competition. \s

"His intent is to help female athletes. His goal was to demonstrate the absurdity and perversion of women's sports. If women were only competing against other women, then he wouldn't have done this. It's not fair for women to compete in physical sports against men."
"> What he did was deny some women who had worked their tails off the chance to win

Andres already did that. But by making an example out of Andres and the cowards in charge, he made it more likely that those women would be permitted a fair contest next time."
"What jerk statement?  He identified as a woman and it was within the rule set.  

Check your privilege bigot"
"It‚Äôs a form of protest. I don‚Äôt care about transgender persons in general, but I certainly take offense to making biological female athletes IRRELEVANT which is what it could come to if all the Women‚Äôs records are taken up by biological men"
"I am not her to talk about my transition, I‚Äôm here to kick some fucking ass."
"Nicola Sturgeon, the PM of Scotland or whatever, got into some controversy over putting a male rapist in a women's prison. Apparently they still have journalism there, because a reporter grilled her over it. He asked how many women asked to be put in men's prison.

"It‚Äôs almost as if biology has something to do with it. But meh, what do I know. I‚Äôm not a biologist."
Just to put the absurdity in perspective the previous bench record was 275lbs and was set by a man claiming to be a woman last year. Homeboy showed up and tossed up 370lbs like it was nothing just to flex. Idk how people cannot see the absurdity of this. I am by no means strong and by no means go to a power lifter gym but I‚Äôve personally seen people put up over 270 and could at one point put up 200lbs myself. Anyone defending this crap needs their head checked.
"Nah we need more of shit like this, it's the only way these people who enable it can see the insanity they've allowed."

"The key difference is that Zuby just filmed himself alone. 

The article is talking about an actual women's competition that the guy entered."
"haha well said, damn"
You CANNOT tell someones gender by simply looking at his dick. It‚Äôs flatly impossible of course‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ 2023
"This is the reasonable way to look at it. I'm as supportive of fair trans rights as possible, and the way you have it laid out seems to be the best balance of compromise possible for now. Pre-hrt, I definitely had a physical advantage over the average woman. Yet after not even all too long on it, that advantage was more than gone as my Testosterone levels dropped slightly below healthy cisfem range. I'm 5'7"", 110lbs, and hauling around a ton of extra volume as body fat instead of muscle now, so there is absolutely no discernible advantage remaining. I'm probably even at a slight disadvantage to a similarly built cis woman because I haven't had nearly a full lifetime to get used to a drastically different body, and it's going to take a lot of reacclimation to be able push it to the same levels I did when playing various sports when younger. 

People try to cheat in sports frequently enough that it always has to be a concern, as fairness is essential to proper competition. Nobody's going to essentially chemically castrate themselves with hrt just to get into the women's league, but they sure as hell can just lie about their identity like this guy did to prove a point. Just can't start forming regulations around such necessities while also subsequently making it needlessly difficult to get on hrt for those who know what they're signing up for. Transgender sports leagues just aren't feasible either as there are very very few trans people (some people outright thinking it's like 20% of people when it's barely 1%) and outside of maybe some dense population centers, there wouldn't be the minimum population necessary to maintain enough membership. I do rather like your ""auditing"" idea too."
"Problem is the people pushing this whole men can play women's sports so long as they say they are a female thing don't acknowledge or care about the very distinct physical/hormonal differences between both sexes/genders and thus trying to be logical like your comment is a waste of energy. 

Inclusivity has no business in this conversation, sure they can have thier own leagues or just play in the 1 that fits what they were born as but making exceptions that hurt others just so they can compete against those they are hurting makes no sense."

"You don't understand the issue if you are saying they need to play according to their sex. If we follow what you're writing then women on HRT will play with women. Regardless of whether or not you think it's OK, there are high school students on HRT, which will absolutely affect their physiology. That is why the Olympics, which has allowed transgender athletes since 2003, has rules for transgender athletes.   

Essentially, I'm saying that whatever they identify with should not determine which federation they compete in. They should compete according to their hormone usage and their sex. I.e. HRT-free males, HRT-free females, females on HRT, and males on HRT.   

Inclusivity isn't harmful to the conversation, the point is to not use inclusivity to overshadow individual accomplishments."

"Most people around the world use the definition I provided. This definition has nothing to do with what people are thinking about when they interact with someone, even if it carries social implications (heavily dependent on culture). It's simply a commonly used descriptive term.

You're halfway to a definition. You've clarified that it's related to self-presentation and behavior.

In the WNBA there have been seven players to dunk in a game, and a ton more can, it just doesn‚Äôt make sense in a regulation game.

"The only sport I know of that women have a slight advantage in (where the record holders are women) is ultra long distance marathons (ones over 100 miles or so), and even there it‚Äôs only a slight edge.

"You're changing the question.

I'm asking for the definition of the word, not for the physical markers that people use to identify those who fit the definition. Certainly there is sometimes physical ambiguity that might result in what they would call mislabelling, but most people around the world are, in fact, concerned about the biological accuracy of the label.

More specifically, the overwhelming majority of cultures around the world are *highly* concerned with the biological implications of sex, specifically 1) the ability to produce offspring, and 2) the physical strengths and weaknesses that correspond to each sex.

The social roles that most cultures have adopted are almost entirely dependent on those biological capabilities, to the point that, whether for good or bad, the failure to meet those expectations is often met with negative social judgement.

So the definition that I've given you is, in fact, both incredibly practical *and* incredibly important in the overwhelming majority of cultures around the world.

And again, you haven't given me *your* definition of the word ""woman"".

I'll give you another shot at it, unless you're okay with me telling you what your definition is."

"First sentence of that article: ""John Fetterman has finally been *released* from the hospital after suffering from a reported bout of severe depression.""

He wasn't ""released"". He was discharged. That is the term we use in the medical field. Why is this important? Because it underscores that this admission was *voluntary*. He was not being held against his will. He wasn't in jail. 

Again, why important? Because it is an admission that he recognizes that he has a job-impairing disability that required inpatient treatment. This may be fine for someone who requires a FML absence in a job where your tasks can be re-assigned or someone else can be hired, even temporarily, to fill the gap. But, this was a sitting, elected U.S. Senator.

"That‚Äôs why people in caves with small arms kept the fight going for over two decades costing US trillions. 

Yeah man. We‚Äôre so effective."
"what part of conventional conflict did you not understand? Afghanistan was not a conventional conflict, at least for the majority of time we were there. We pretty much rolled over the Taliban during the initial phase of the invasion. It was the whole counter-insurgency and winning the hearts and minds thing that was the problem. Same thing in 2003 Iraq, we smoked the Iraqi military in the invasion, but the hard parts were the counter insurgency afterwards. If the US entered the conflict in Ukraine, those are issues we wouldn't really have to deal with."
"At worst, Ukraine would have a low level insurgency in Crimea and the Donbass if Ukraine was restored to their 1991 borders and Russia completely expelled."

This is exactly what will happen. The Dems set the precedent that it's fine to go after an ex president because you dislike them or their party and that becomes the new tradition. Biden should be terrified for himself and his family because he's got a lot more than paying Stormy Daniels to sign an NDA in his closet.
"The difference is the Dems have an advantage with the media and even the ""right"" people in positions of power, like the FBI, etc.  Could say the same for establishment GOP.  Look back at that behind door settlement for Congressman regarding sexual misconduct.  It's settled in secret, we'll never know who was involved. The media doesn't seem to be interested in it either, yet every one of em gets giddy going after Trump for this porn star payment. So much hypocrisy and corruption right in our faces."

It sounds to me like they actually want to save lives instead of just sweeping people under the rug until they OD and are no longer a problem.

"Methadone clinics don't help people get off drugs. It enslaves them to new drugs and governmental dependency. Local governments decriminalize everything, ""to help people"" have only led to an increase of use, abuse, homelessness, and ODs.

"Methadone and suboxone clinics help people get off drugs who *want* to get off drugs. They do this by offering them scientific measurements that can be cut down and wheened off of. It offers some regularity to their dosage so they can maintain a job and continue to have a life and build a routine. That is something you cannot do with street drugs since every dose is different and non dependable.
  
I personally know a handful of people who got clean and are still clean after quitting street drugs and using medicinal drugs to finally get clean.

The increases in drug use, OD and homelessness has been increasing since before decriminalization, decriminalization just let people stop hiding. Maybe you should be asking yourself why people choose drugs over having a normal life and what could society have done better to change this."
"I think it takes both positive and negative consequences to help an addict to quit. If you baby some addicts, you can literally ""mother"" an addict to death. if you remove all those negative consequences, you might prolong someone's addiction. Programs like drug diversion of offenders into rehabs rather than prisons are ignored regarding how many people they save from addiction and death.  Decriminalizing yes, but there still needs to be a consequence so society has a tool to affect change in it's addict population."
"I mean maybe some but, you also have to remember they are people and at the end of the day, what they want to actually do matters. They have to actually be done and want to quit, that seems to have to align with goals.

Drugs get in the way of dreams and goals if you have them which is a good reason to quit. You have to actually want to achieve a goal though.

I have a buddy who‚Äôs been in and out of over a dozen rehabs (been 10 years so maybe more) parents and family basically disowned him.

These people ultimately want to destroy our institutions and the stability that we have through them. They are destructive, not constructive.

Oh he survived he Holocaust alright.   But not that way.  In his own words, he had someone affirm he was someone else, while he worked to take away property from Jews.  In his own words, if he wasn't doing it, someone else would have and he'd be in a camp...

I'm sure the fact that Soros dollars buys a ton of advertising with them isn't related to their willingness to abandon the truth, though."
He laundered the money through a PAC basically. A PAC who‚Äôs whole purpose was to fund campaigns for DAs that support Soros‚Äô objectives - so it might as well have been out of his own pocket.  Pretty lame ‚Äúfact-check‚Äù if you ask me.

"But 6 year olds today can pick their gender so...

I'm not conservative, nor am I scared of a boogeyman.  But I am appalled that he can call himself a survivor and get away with it.  

Even today, he has no remorse--he said so himself.  A 14 year old rapist is a rapist.  A 14 year old murderer is still a murderer.  But a full-grown man who can look back on those things fondly, or without remorse, is not a survivor.  They are a monster."
He also mentioned that it was the ‚Äúhappiest time of his life‚Äù and an ‚Äúexhilarating‚Äù experience. So it‚Äôs not like he was just doing it to survive and lay low - he *enjoyed* it.
Why would you have remorse for hiding from nazis as a child? Did you want him to just die instead?
"No, my opinion isn't based on him wanting to stay off the radar.  That would be one thing, and that's not what he did.  He didn't just stay out of sight.  By his own accounts, he turned on his own people in a way that led to *their* death, and the loss of *their* fortunes.  That's what I wish he wouldn't have done.

"School districts are VERY complicit. When I was a student for LAUSD I reported a teacher for inappropriate behaviors. He would bring empty bottles of booze as ‚Äúcultural awareness‚Äù. He would offer us drinks in class, no one would take because we knew he was weird. He would tell us that we can go to his house for studying sessions. He would check out every student in a deviant way. You know, your typical grooming behavior. He had a go at me verbally and I decide I would burn his career to the floor. Told my mom, my mom went to the principal the very next day, and he was escorted out of school grounds in hand cuffs.

When I went to testify against him, I found out that he had a number of complaints from other students from different schools for the same thing. So, LAUSD had him bouncing from one school to another whenever a complaint arose."

This seems to be how he is framing the assignment.

But the ""with whom would you do it"" part is possibly the worst part of all.

I think giving my taxes to private schools is mismanaging my money.
Doesn't it make way more sense to just stop asigning funding based on how much taxes a district gets (ensuring wealthy children from wealthy areas go to wealthy schools and poor children in poor areas go to underfunded schools) and instead just give an amount to the school per student per year (like the uk) thereby ensuring all schools get the same funding levels regardless of where they are located?
Absolutely agree.
This is how it should be. I don't want my taxes going to private schools. I want them to be used on public schools. So many states have public schools that aren't properly funded on purpose as a way to push students into private and charter schools and to create political fodder and push culture war issues that fire up their base.  The cherokee nation in Oklahoma is stepping in to help fund public schools that the state won't. they believe every kid should have the tools to succeed in public school and I agree.
I spent more money on a house and taxes to be in a better school district. I don't want my house to lose value or my district to get worse. Socialism doesn't work.

"I understand that you did that because of the way the system works, and I understand not wanting your school district to suffer. However the fact of the matter is millions of kids in your country are suffering due to the way this system is set up.

All taxes in the country for education are equally distributed based on a per student basis. That way, every child gets the same amount of funding and eductation offered by the goverment regardless of their backgroud. If you want private education, it is available and you can pay for it."

So what happens to those kids that can't afford the best schools? Or even the mediocre schools?

"> Poor kids are not given a fair or equitable education based purely on their district.

"Poverty is heavily tied to the welfare system. Dems should stop supporting the federal welfare system and federal school system. Poor people become richer the more they do for themselves. Goverment handouts only make people poorer since they stop doing for themselves.

As for the schools, the schools only survive if they have parents paying for their kids to be there. If the school has to depend on the community with no funding from the government, what do you think 'tuition' will look like? ""Rich people"" don't live in the hood -- if the school is in the hood, it has to depend on the parents.

As for climbing the social ladder, that happens primarily as an outgrowth of a solid two-parent household. People learn work ethic and financial discipline, and it mostly happens in the home. That has nothing to do with school.

Shouldn't it be the goal of every American to ensure the youth all get a fair and equitable start in life regardless of their zipcode? Or the wealth of their parents? Isn't that the American dream?
"
I get where you're coming from, and I agree that it's important for people to take responsibility for their own lives. But the reality is that not everyone has the same opportunities and resources to do that. Some people are born into poverty and face systemic barriers that prevent them from succeeding, no matter how hard they work.

That's where government programs like the federal welfare system and federal school system come in. They're designed to help level the playing field and give people a chance to succeed, regardless of their background. It's not about handouts or entitlement, it's about creating a fair and just society where everyone has a shot at success. That's the American dream right?

And let's be real, not all schools are created equal. Some schools in poor neighborhoods don't have the resources to provide a quality education, and that's not the fault of the parents or the kids. By investing in the federal school system, we can ensure that every child, regardless of their zip code, has access to a quality education that will prepare them for success in life.

I know you value hard work and self-reliance, and I do too. But we also have to acknowledge that sometimes people need a little help to get ahead, and that's where government programs can make a real difference. We all benefit when everyone has a chance to succeed, and that's something we should all be able to agree on."
"If you compare my property value to one of equal quality and size in a bad school district, it cuts it in about half, which would be about 80% of my net worth. So no, I paid my dues.

The thing you socialists don't understand is that in the pursuit of equality, you simply destroy quality. In the pursuit of equity, you just steal someone else's home equity. Socialists try to equalize the pie. Capitalism makes a bigger pie."
"> Shouldn't it be the goal of every American to ensure the youth all get a fair and equitable start in life regardless of their zipcode?

No. It should be the goal of the parents of the child to instill in that child the work ethic and principles needed for that child to suceed at their goals. Liberty gives you the right to live your life the way you see fit, but the risk of liberty is that you also have the right to make wrong choices and screw yourself up. That is a risk worth having since the reward for doing it right can be so great."
">But the reality is that not everyone has the same opportunities and resources to do that. 

That's always been the case, throughout history.

>Some people are born into poverty and face systemic barriers that prevent them from succeeding, no matter how hard they work.

There *used* to be systemic barriers. Those ended in 1964 in America. How hard - and smart - you work can pay rewards. The three things every person needs to do prevent permanent poverty in America is (1) graduate high school, (2) don't have kids out of wedlock, (3) get a job and fight to keep it.   If you do these three things you are almost guaranteed not to remain in poverty all your life.
 
> That's where government programs like the federal welfare system and federal school system come in. They're designed to help level the playing field and give people a chance to succeed, regardless of their background. 

Except that this never happens. The government has been fighting a ""war on poverty"" since the 1960s and there are more poor people than ever. 

>It's not about handouts or entitlement, it's about creating a fair and just society where everyone has a shot at success. That's the American dream right?
 
It is 100% an entitlement. When multiple generations grow up in government housing projects subsisting on food stamps and welfare checks, you have no shot at anything. That is whole-heartedly NOT the American dream. Capt John Smith showed us this in the very beginnings of this country, how socialism and socialist programs don't work.
https://www.wordfoundations.com/socialism-of-jamestown-and-plymouth-fails/
  
> And let's be real, not all schools are created equal. 

They are mostly run by government and unions. They don't have to be as long as government subsidies keep coming in. Also note the number of school boards fighting to have concerned parents labeled as ""terrorists"" so that they don't interfere with the poor schooling and indoctrination.

>Some schools in poor neighborhoods don't have the resources to provide a quality education, and that's not the fault of the parents or the kids.

No it is the fault of the national teacher's unions and the DoE. DoE and federal oversight should end and oversight/funding of schools should be returned to the states.

>By investing in the federal school system, we can ensure that every child, regardless of their zip code, has access to a quality education that will prepare them for success in life.

Alright, this will probably blow your mind, but here goes: Your child's education doesn't directly affect me or make my life better. When *I* go to school, then education directly benefits me. Someone else's education only benefits me or my neighbor in a vaugely tertiary degree, but it doesn't directly make my life better. That is why it is up to the family to instill the desire to learn and a work ethic so that a person will be bound and determined to improve *their own life*. The best schools in the world will not compel a lazy and unmotivated generation to bother to crack a book. Parents do that. Education happens in the home. School is just where the curriculm is presented and tested. Look no further than home-schooling to see how this works. I know several people that were home-schooled and they turned out to be fine, hard-working adults.
 
> I know you value hard work and self-reliance, and I do too. But we also have to acknowledge that sometimes people need a little help to get ahead, and that's where government programs can make a real difference. 

No, that's where private industry and religious groups and churches come in, just like they did before the welfare state. Yes there will be less welfare when private organizations do it. But that means they will prioritize the weak, sick and infirm first. If able-bodied people are left out because there is nothing left, well, too bad. Able bodied people should be working.

>We all benefit when everyone has a chance to succeed, and that's something we should all be able to agree on.

No, not really. I benefit when *I* suceed. My life is not affected at all when Bill Gates makes another million dollars."
" 
I understand where you're coming from, and I agree that hard work and self-reliance are important values. But we also have to acknowledge that not everyone has the same opportunities and resources to succeed, especially if they were born into poverty or face systemic barriers. It's not about making excuses, it's just the reality for some people.

While it's true that systemic barriers were officially abolished in 1964 with the Civil Rights Act, the effects of centuries of discrimination and inequality are still present today. That's where government programs like the federal welfare system and federal school system come in. They're designed to help level the playing field and give people a chance to succeed, regardless of their background. It's not about handouts or entitlement, it's about creating a fair and just society where everyone has a shot at success. That's what the American dream is all about, right?

I understand your concerns about the government's effectiveness in fighting poverty, but poverty is a complex issue that can't be solved overnight. it's true that there are still many people living in poverty, it's also true that government programs have helped millions of people get out of poverty and improve their lives.

Regarding schools, I agree that not all schools are created equal and that's a problem. But I don't think the solution is to simply leave it up to the states or private organizations. Investing in the federal school system is important because it ensures that every child, regardless of their zip code, has access to a quality education that will prepare them for success in life. And while a child's education may not directly affect you, we all benefit when everyone has the opportunity to succeed. When we have a well-educated workforce, we have a stronger economy and a better society for everyone. We also have less crime, less teen pregnancy, and lower poverty rates.

Ultimately, I think we all want the same thing: a fair and just society where everyone has a chance to succeed. While private industry and religious groups can certainly play a role in helping people in need, I don't think we can rely solely on them to solve these complex issues. Government programs have an important role to play in creating a safety net for those who need it, and in investing in the future of our country through education and other programs"
"Our voter roles (West Virginia) still has my signature from where I first registered when I was 18, over 40 years ago. My signature doesn‚Äôt look anything like that anymore."
There is **ZERO** logical reason why it's legal to mail in a ballot but illegal to buy a gun on the Internet and have it shipped to your house.
Sure. /s
This is the main problem I have with signature verification. It‚Äôs comparing it in a lot of cases to when you tried to scratch something onto a horrible touchscreen at the DMV a decade prior that looks nothing like your signature when you do it with with pen and paper.
"As much as I HATE it from a privacy aspect, a national ID, using the same smart card tech that the DoD uses for CaCs would be the way to go.  You need to physically insert your card and enter the pin to vote."
This and I can say my signature never looks the same.
If you buy a printer you can make as many guns as you want. Also ballots. Lol.
"I'm always flabbergasted when the 'Mail in voting is safe and secure!' argument. Like hell it is! The more hands that touch a vote, the greater chance for something to happen to that vote in transit. Hell, USPS has lost me several expensive packages through their system, if they can lose a package, they can lose an envelope with a piece of paper in it too."

"I read this as ‚ÄúYes corporate media masters, I will repeat what the TV box told me to.‚Äù"
"I don‚Äôt disagree at all. State issued identification is the way to go, but I don‚Äôt know what to do about mail in ballots."
Privacy is not my biggest concern about that idea. This sounds like it takes power away from states and it also sounds expensive.
We need an official National ID because the lack of one has caused everyone to use SS# which is terribly insecure.   Refuse to satisfy what the market needs and it can make terrible decisions attempting to satisfy the need.
"All of the mail in votes are handled by usps union members who endorse democrats 100% of the time.  

Don‚Äôt worry everything is secure."
Ban them.
I don't really see how it would take away from the states. They could still issues drivers license. This would be a smart version of a social security card which is already federally issued.
"Yup that's a huge issue. Being able to authenticate with a smart card to a central provider would be amazing. That provider could then use saml or something similar to allow you to use other services, without them ever having access to your private material."
Not happening.
States have a good deal of authority in how they administer their elections. This makes a lot of sense...especially because more impactful elections are ultimately local. Setting additional federal requirements for elections within the states strips them of that. This would likely impact state and municipal elections and pass a new expensive system onto all tax payers. The threat we need to prevent is not all fraud. It is only fraud large enough to change elections. There are better ways to do that.

"Our founding fathers owned slaves.

We celebrate their achievements, not their failures."
Always ruining my civ games
Thank you for the Civ reference.
"Well, that would be a fair criticism."
"I mean, I think it's totally fair to say ""I understand this person did a lot of good but was still fundamentally a bad person in many aspects"". What good does ignoring all the bad do but serve to cover up the crimes they committed? Surely its better to both teach their achievements and teach their failures"
There's nothing to be gained on either an individual or societal level from focusing on the negatives. The opposite can be said for focusing on the positive accomplishments.
"Because there's no point?

What exactly are you hoping to accomplish with this lesson?"
"I disagree, I mean the saying ""teach history or be doomed to repeat it"" is a saying for a reason, right? Plus, there is no ""perfect good"" or ""total evil"". People are complex, and often fall into a grey area of morality. It's important to teach kids this, and using historical figures like ghandi (yes he freed India from the empire, he was also a nonce) or John rabe (was a nazi, saved 100,000 chinese civilians from the japanese) serves to give children an example of this to learn from. 

I think there's a hell of a lot of emotional learning and intelligence that comes from having that understanding. I find people who do believe in true right or true wrong tend to be very inflexible in understanding other belief systems or points of view. You say ""there's nothing to be gained"" but I disagree, what you gain is the understanding NOT to do what that guy did, and that being famous or influential doesn't give you a pass to be a cock in your personal life."
"Well the age old saying ""those who don't learn history are doomed to repeat it"" is a saying for a reason. I would hope the accomplishments that you get from teaching kids that historical figures that do good can also do bad is more intellectually rounded kids. George Washington owned slaves, ghandi was a nonce, understanding that 'good' people can do bad things is an important thing to learn as you grow up."
">Plus, there is no ""perfect good"" or ""total evil"". People are complex, and often fall into a grey area of morality.

I'm not sure who you're arguing with. Who is saying any of this? 

>I think there's a hell of a lot of emotional learning and intelligence that comes from having that understanding

Clearly not if the result of such ""learning"" is animalistic destruction of statues. It's almost as if focusing on negatives of historical figures to the detriment of recognizing their positive actions results in the exact opposite of ""emotional learning and intelligence.""

>that being famous or influential doesn't give you a pass to be a cock in your personal life.

Again, no one argued this."
"Huh?

Nobody thinks people who do good things can't do bad things. It's been a damn long time, and I haven't really heard any movement that is ""doomed to repeat"" what Gandhi did, aside from the good principles he championed.

And why exactly is Gandhi an appropriate example for this lesson?"
"Well, you're basing this off the actions of one person or a small group of people who did this damage for any number of reasons. There were plenty of groups inside of India that were very against the idea of partition and against ghandi for ideological reasons. Hell, I'm studying engineering and I personally know some Indian exchange students on my course that really do not like ghandi. Im sure there are american children of indian immigrants to the USA that hold these values too. My point being we don't actually KNOW why they beheaded this statue or who did it.

However that said, I really do politely disagree that teaching people the bad parts of historical figures is too their detriment, nor do I disagree with a new generation coming in and saying ""well, I understand he did X but because of Y I don't feel he should be idolised with a statue"". Not that that means we should have vandalism,  just that each generation sees things differently, and should not be forced to continue to praise or idolise people just because the previous generations did. I don't believe teaching the bad parts is ""to the detriment"" of the good parts. In this case, clearly someone took onus to the statue, but this is not universal. By your logic, we should stop telling children that the founding fathers owned slaves."
"I'm not really sure to be honest, probably something like ""50 year old me should not be sleeping naked with 12 year old girls""? You'd be amazed how many people who are alive today are OK with that idea"
">Well, you're basing this off the actions of one person or a small group of people who did this damage for any number of reasons

Did you forget the violence and wanton iconoclasm during the BLM riots? This is hardly some isolated incident. There's substantially more evidence that obsessing over the flaws of historical figures rather than their accomplishments is actually detrimental to society than the reverse.

>Hell, I'm studying engineering and I personally know some Indian exchange students

Okay? Are you arguing that instead of educating American children on the achievements of Ghandi, we should instead condemn the man because of some dudes you met once?

>nor do I disagree with a new generation coming in and saying ""well, I understand he did X but because of Y I don't feel he should be idolised with a statue"".

There are exactly zero universally loved people. There is not a historical figure who didn't wrong other people or have some kind of character flaws or do something bad. This attitude would mean we should have no statues or memorials or anything to anyone. Should we destroy our war memorials in DC because some of those soldiers whose names appear there were bad? 

>By your logic, we should stop telling children that the founding fathers owned slaves.

Lol no. Quote anything I've said that matches this. You're setting up and knocking down one strawman after another."
">You'd be amazed how many people who are alive today are OK with that idea

Because of Gandhi???

What world are you living in?"
">Did you forget the violence and wanton iconoclasm during the BLM riots? This is hardly some isolated incident. 

Sure, that's a fair point. 


>There's substantially more evidence that obsessing over the flaws of historical figures rather than their accomplishments is actually detrimental to society than the reverse.

I would like to see a paper that supports this, or any of the evidence you are talking about. I'm not saying this argumentatively I genuinely am interested.



>Are you arguing that instead of educating American children on the achievements of Ghandi, we should instead condemn the man because of some dudes you met once?

No, my point was opinions of him are not just divided in the USA, but also in his home country. Also these are good friends of mine, not just some dudes. 

>This attitude would mean we should have no statues or memorials or anything to anyone. Should we destroy our war memorials in DC because some of those soldiers whose names appear there were bad? 

That's a broad generalisation, almost every man bar none previous to the last few generations were raging sexists and I'm not suggesting we tare down every statue of every man that died pre 1900s. Personally I really don't thing confederate generals should have statues, but I'm not American so take that as you will. 

>Lol no. Quote anything I've said that matches this. You're setting up and knocking down one strawman after another.

Here you go

>There's substantially more evidence that obsessing over the flaws of historical figures rather than their accomplishments is actually detrimental to society than the reverse."
"Sorry, I see how you could have taken my comment that way. What I mean to say is if we leave out the bad bars when we teach about historical figures it gives a bias view of history. We are being disingenuous to the next generation by not giving them the whole truth and letting them form their own opinion."
">I would like to see a paper

It's called the statue destruction you previously agreed was a good point. That is evidence of the direct consequences of focusing on grievances every American saw with their own eyes. 

>No, my point was opinions of him are not just divided in the USA, but also in his home country

Who cares? We're not arguing about whether or not Indians have conflicted opinions of ghandi, we're arguing about whether it's beneficial or not to focus on the flaws of historical figures rather that their accomplishments. No one cares that you have friends who belong to a group representing 1/7 humans on the earth today.

>That's a broad generalisation, almost every man bar none previous to the last few generations were raging sexists

Yes, and virtually no one focuses on those kinds of flaws for historical figures because 1) there's no novelty or notoriety to it and 2) there's no benefit to focusing on it. History books don't say ""George Washington was pivotal to creating today's successful western hemisphere /* 

/* but he was also a sexist.""

>Here you go

Can you clarify how that is the same thing as saying we shouldn't teach children the fou ding fathers had slaves? 

And now that I think of it, what *is* the point of teaching that? It seems as pointless as teaching that every man before 2000 was a sexist. We don't put an asterisk on MLK's speeches warning that he did some sketchy stuff. We don't put an asterisk on Da Vinci warning that was super whatever-ism and whatever-phobic."
">letting them form their own opinion.

Opinion about *what*...? 

Do you think history books are gossip rags? We learned about Gandhi because of the influence he had on human history, not to tout him as a hero. Saying, ""Yeah, he was great, but remember he was also a vegetarian so eeehhh."" Is bizarre.

There are billions of pedos and vegetarians throughout history you can point to and mock, but we don't make a habit of it because that isn't what learning history is about."
">It's called the statue destruction you previously agreed was a good point. That is evidence of the direct consequences of focusing on grievances every American saw with their own eyes. 

As I mentioned previously, we have no idea what the motivation was for the person who destroyed that atatue. It could have been a white leftist 20yo, it could have me a 30yo Indian immigrant with grievances against him, it could have been an arsehole teenager who thought it was funny. You have no evidence that connects the destruction of this statue to the teaching of history in this way.

I'm asking for academic papers that show the teaching of the bad side of historical figures leads to what you claim. I would be very interested to read them.

>Who cares? We're not arguing about whether or not Indians have conflicted opinions of ghandi, we're arguing about whether it's beneficial or not to focus on the flaws of historical figures rather that their accomplishments.

See my point above, the reason I mentioned some Indians disliking him was to point out it may have been Indians who destroyed the statue. Probably not, but it could have been.


>And now that I think of it, what is the point of teaching that? It seems as pointless as teaching that every man before 2000 was a sexist. We don't put an asterisk on MLK's speeches warning that he did some sketchy stuff. We don't put an asterisk on Da Vinci warning that was super whatever-ism and whatever-phobic.

Teaching children about the founding fathers' ownership of slaves is not meant to discredit their contributions to American history, but rather to provide a more complete and accurate understanding of the past. If you DONT teach it, you are lying by omission to the children you are teaching. Similarly, acknowledging Gandhi's flaws does not negate the positive impact he had on India's independence movement, but rather adds depth and complexity to his legacy.

if we only focus on the positive aspects of historical figures, we risk perpetuating harmful myths and ideologies. For example, if we only teach children about the founding fathers' accomplishments and ignore their ownership of slaves, we perpetuate the idea that slavery was not a major part of American history, when in fact it was a central pillar of the nation's economy for centuries. By ignoring this aspect of history, we risk perpetuating racism and other forms of discrimination."
"Take Washington as an example. Someone i was arguing with today on this subreddit questioned WHY exactly we teach that Washington had slaves. We teach that because he was a man that called for freedom for all, who founded this country on that principle yet owned hundreds of his fellow human beings. 

In ghandis case, he was a man who we teach as a principled and just person, whos integrity, dignity and his refusal to fight bought the largest empire the world had ever seen to its knees. His principles, the same ones we place him on a pedestal for, also included sleeping with little girls. When you look at it as part of the whole, its all important."
"All that this indictment is doing is helping Trump's campaign. There's no there there, and it's obviously a political move given that they waited until now to do this. It's not like new information surfaced. It's not like these people haven't been in office for a couple of years now. They picked this time to do it. 

Everyone knows that it's total BS, but Bragg wanted to do this now. I think the Democrats know this too. It's almost like they want Trump as the nominee knowing that BS indictments like this will only help Trump garner more support from Republicans. I mean, I'm fully on the DeSantis 2024 train (even though he hasn't announced, it seems obvious that he will), and even I look at this and can't help but feel some sympathy for Trump and this clown show of an indictment. This all feels like a very calculated effort to get him the nomination knowing that the left will be able to get their base out against Trump to re-elect Joe Biden."
"The Left is doing a great job getting trump nominated and then having him lose to Biden in the general. There will likely be a few more indictments coming out which will further tarnish him and make him damaged goods to independents/moderate voters.

Let's hope the primary voters see through all of this and make the right choice."

Very likely that the shooting was related to some kind of Saudi fuckery that went horribly wrong and was subsequently covered up, just like the Saudis‚Äô involvement with 9/11 (which some suspect Alaweed was involved in as well)."

Ranked choice voting nationally would be interesting and maybe allow for some independents to break through."
"Democrats are like women beaters, if Republicans just didn't make them so angry all the time they wouldn't have to resort to such violence."
"100% of school shootings are in gun free zones, yet they still blame us."
In the last year name the ‚Äúyoung liberals‚Äù who have committed mass shootings vs the ‚Äúyoung conservatives‚Äù. I‚Äôll wait.
"An in depth analysis of ideological motivators behind mass shootings and other terrorist attacks found right wing motivation to be as large of a factor as Islamic extremism. Left-wing motivated terrorism is significantly lower. Regardless of which ideology fosters the best government or culture for America, at the current time, there is a deep frustration and anger driving right wing extremism in America. Believing that the government has become completely illegitimate is a pretty big motivator for people to commit violence.

Having armed police or some other kind of armed guard in the schools. The Nashville nut had other targets picked out but chose the school since it was the softest target. Just because their solutions don‚Äôt punish the innocent for the actions of others doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt have ideas.

"Do you have any evidence, literally anything, that the justice system worked ""better"" between 2017-2021 than before or after?"

Hook, line, and sinker on ranked choice huh?"

Yet cops and republicans make up most of the domestic violence offenders.

A tale as old as time. The other thing is the enemy.
I mentioned ranked choice because in a two-party system each side calls the other the enemy. Ranked choice dissolves some of the hold of a two-party system.

Incorrect. Highest occurrence of domestic violence is lesbians.

"Only for who was targeted. If this insane person let some other ideology become their whole identity the target would‚Äôve been different. To focus on the ideology is just an attempt to politically weaponize these events to demonize your opposition and it‚Äôs what left does every time so it‚Äôs not unreasonable for people to do the same when it goes the other way, what‚Äôs good for the goose is good for the gander after all. But in doing so no one is trying to find what the actual cause could be.

At the same time, telling an obviously mentally disturbed group of people that Christians are out to genocide them probably isn‚Äôt a very intelligent thing to do.

And not a single student knew what fascism is‚Ä¶
"""Everyone I disagree with is a fascist!"""
"Shame on the school for not intervening.  People need to be safe to learn in a school.  Even if the idea is antithetical to what you believe.   

Silencing people doesn't silence support, it only grows it.  If you want to change the message, change the hearts of those listening."
"Ah yes, one of the key hallmarks of fascism: Opposing executions without due process! Wait a minute..."
the irony
"*""Oh, you want to protect unborn baby's right to life? You must be a f---ing fascist!""*"
That's not ok. However. Go have the same assembly in a public park near the school and let the police arrest the fascist protestors. That's the effects of sick indoctrination.
"There was a clip where she said something like ‚Äúdo you want me to look up the definition of fascist for you?‚Äù And the crowd all said ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù

It was funny if it wasn‚Äôt so sad."
"Maybe one day they‚Äôll have a Sixth Sense moment when they learn it was them all along. I know that‚Äôs too much to ask, though."
"Yeah the left needs to start making better cases, they‚Äôre not absolved of that responsibility just because they perceive this and everything else in terms of oppression and victimhood, like all they have to do is battlecry. As someone with some flexibility on the issue, I need a better answer to ‚Äúhuman life‚Äù than ‚Äúsmash the patriarchy‚Äù and Handmaid‚Äôs Tale cosplay. ‚ÄúHuman life‚Äù is a pretty solid claim as far as I can tell."
"Their approach is persuasion through coercion.  They want to make laws saying that anything they don't agree with is ""hate speech."""
"So, like CRT?"
"The solution to having your voice silenced isn‚Äôt to roll over. 

Also, the speaker was invited by a pro-life group of students. 

What needs to happen is the school needs to enforce their own rules."
Ignorance is Strength!
Difference here is this is an optional event.
"Either way, it doesn't matter who invited the speaker. Many channels of approval for appearance took place. The crowd let to protest and act out violently should be charged for the actions they took against the speaker. Saying that it's OK and not taking a positive posture in the matter is just like saying the school made a good decision. On the other foot, if this was presented in the public square, off school campus, the police would have been involved and there would most likely be consequences for the mobs actions."
"Certain state governments are trying to ban th subject at colleges, where it is optional. So I think it is still comparable."
"Do you have sources? Banning it as a subject of study? Or banning it‚Äôs use for justification of ‚Äúequity‚Äù administration policy? I have seen none of the former but some of the latter, which is a completely different point of discussion."

Isn't a tenant of narcissism to always turn yourself into the victim to avoid accepting responsibility?
this rhetoric pisses me off so much
War is peace. Ignorance is strenght. Supporting a shooter is supporting the Christian victims.
"Off topic but I want to say something.

I understand the point and what is trying to be said, but we should be clear that *nobody deserves love or respect* and dignity is something you give yourself.

Nobody owes you love and respect must be earned.

Edit: People keep commenting that this is not what Jesus said. Jesus called upon us to love one another, which is a moral obligation upon ourselves. That is very different from saying that each person is owed love. I cannot sit here and demand you love me, though it would be spiritually healthy for you to do so. No, instead I may encourage you to love everyone, including me. My argument here is not that we shouldn't love ""trans"" people but rather that it is amoral for people to insist they are owed love."

Has Biden even said one thing to soothe the Christian community he pretends he's a part of?
"I don‚Äôt care what this person identifies as, is trans or whatever. Kids were shot and this person did it. Plain and simple."
This is the timeline we live in where a trans-identifying person kills several people including *small children* and the only thing these dumbasses can talk about is how it affects the ‚Äútrans community‚Äù. But what do you expect from a bunch of narcissists that expects literally the entire world to conform to their twisted view of reality in order to make them feel warm inside?
This is insane! Who would have thought shit would end up doing a 180. We are living in a 3rd world totalitarian government ran shithole.
"It‚Äôs absolutely disgusting how the WH and media are spinning this tragedy. Trying to make it all about the LGBT community and how oppressed they are when in reality the ‚Äúattacks against them‚Äùare just people pushing back against the radical insanity. Floridas bill last year is an example of this. 

If anyone‚Äôs under attack it‚Äôs Christian‚Äôs and other communities that don‚Äôt subscribe to progressive or other left wing ideologies."
"This person was clearly unhinged and dangerous and I really don't give a crap what they felt or what they believed. They are monsters who went after children and there is no justification.

This person is not a reflection on the trans community or transgender people. And any attempt to try to make a connection is just as disingenuous irresponsible and cruel as trying to say that all gun owners are inherently violent or a threat. We can condemn this monster but not bring down an entire community with them.

These two statements are not contradictory and if anything they reinforce each other."
Most protected class of human in the history of time
"That's the plan for historical purposes. They want people to believe they were the victims and in time ""justified"" for what they did or are going to do, and they are an ends justifies the means group."

Not a good look at all
"Okay but the post on the right has nothing to do with the shooter. It‚Äôs trans visibility today, so that‚Äôs why they posted it. You can have your beliefs about whatever but this is making it seem like they posted that in defensive of the shooter which is absolutely not true."

Seems like a message is trying to be sent that theres some agenda in the trans community to murder Christians or something. Why don‚Äôt you look up for me the predominant race and sexuality of most school shooters?
"I'm sorry, but I was assured by lots of upvotes that this wasn't happening.

Fucking gaslighting never stops with them does it. It's almost like when your entire belief system is constructed on false premises you have to go out of your way to deny reality and make sure everyone else does too."

"I commented on some other peoples comments to but the post on the right was for trans visibility day today, it has nothing to do with the shooter, just shitting timing really."
Supporting trans people generally is supporting the shooter?
"I think a hard pill to swallow is that you shouldn‚Äôt expect everyone to embrace and promote you with open arms: tolerance is enough. 

‚ÄúLive and let live‚Äù and ‚Äúyou do you, if someone doesn‚Äôt like it then screw ‚Äòem‚Äù has been replaced by ‚Äúyou must validate every aspect of my life, even if you‚Äôre a random stranger‚Äù and ‚Äúyou do you, if someone doesn‚Äôt like it then they must be stopped at all cost‚Äù. 

Avenue Q was a smash hit musical in the 2000s and had songs with quotes like ‚Äúeveryone‚Äôs a little bit racist sometimes, doesn‚Äôt mean we go around committing hate crimes‚Äù. Someone rediscovered a book from the 90s giving advice to newly out LGB individuals with advice such as ‚Äúit‚Äôs unhealthy and unrealistic to expect everyone on Earth to be accepting of your sexuality, instead cherish your friends and family who love you even if they don‚Äôt 100% understand‚Äù. Both of these are genuinely healthy ways to look at the world instead of what we have now which has been described as ‚Äúreverse-cognitive behavior therapy‚Äù."
Just like Jesus said.
"Reminds me of one of my business classes where we talked about work place values.  Some people believe respect is earned where some people believe respect is given.  Could also be a philosophical debate but I‚Äôm on the respect is earned side.  This same concept funnels through many channels which is why we probably see such a divide in our country.  I‚Äôll treat everyone kindly but until you‚Äôve proven yourself to be useful, at least in a workplace setting, you‚Äôre essentially a warm body at that point in my world.  The LGTB community wants everyone to love them unconditionally but they haven‚Äôt proven to anyone as to why we should.  As far as I‚Äôm concerned they‚Äôre the kids in high school that no one wanted anything to do with because they served no value outside of creating problems for everyone and it‚Äôs transcended into adulthood except now they‚Äôve taken over the media portion of our country and everyone is just supposed to accept the circus lifestyle they‚Äôve created for themselves."
The only people that get unconditional love is kids (from their parents) and pets (from their owners).
"Shouldn't it be the other way around? I mean, it makes sense to me to treat everyone with respect unless they prove they do not deserve my kindness."
"Uhhhhh, yeah no. every human is deserving of *basic* respect and dignity by virtue of the fact they are human beings. No more, and no less."
"That‚Äôs one of the biggest problems with this world rate now and what I believe is a major reason why so many kids are depressed, anxious etc 

And why some go down a path of isolation and radicalization.

People are taught from a young age that the world is all loving treat others how you wanna be treated, always treat people with respect.

Children think that respect is something that is passively given which it is in terms of basic passive human respect.

Like respecting someone‚Äôs space, right to privacy all that stuff just being a decent human.

Then there‚Äôs actual respect such as people wanting to be around you, people wanting to learn more about your ideals and so on.

There‚Äôs a difference between respect we‚Äôd all give one another as curtesy for being part of the same species, then there‚Äôs respecting somebody as a person by the conduct of there character.

We gotta stop teaching kids that everybody in this world is gonna care about them and respect them because it almost guarantees disappointment.

You have a whole generation of kids who think there always gonna have all the good stuff in life from people then they leave high school/ college lose most of there friends and become depressed.

Aside from kids knowing there family will always love an respect them, they should be taught everybody else in society doesn‚Äôt have to like or respect them.

Only through hard work and proving you‚Äôre a good reliable person will you then get the respect from society you want. 

Gotta teach them to build themselves up from what they are so they have a goal on who they wanna be

If you‚Äôre goal driven and focused on improving yourself the respect you crave comes from within and not from other people most of the time"
True words my friend. You earn love and respect based on your actions not just because you exist.
That would be contrary to the words of Jesus who said all deserve love and are loved by God
"Disagree.  We are all children of God.  We all deserve love and respect.  However, we should not tolerate perversion and wickedness."
"Respect should be given automatically, IMO.  Trust must be earned."
pretty sure that's not what Jesus said...
Exact same thing I was thinking. But where is there to go??
I opened this and this is it for me there is something about this for me that is extremely eye opening. This makes an agenda and purposeful confusion an absolute certainty
This is what happens when we replace God with government.
This. What evidence do these loons have that there is a ‚Äúcoordinated attack on LGBT people‚Äùbesides some bills being passed that are just regulating who can use what bathroom and how kids as young as 5-6 years old shouldn‚Äôt be taught things like gender identity.

"But that's why they want access to yours, to indoctrinate them into keeping their ideas alive. Homeschool is already under attack, expect that pressure to increase with time"
They didn't post an image. It was taken from statements made by the WH press secretary in a press briefing.
"The context is it actually has nothing to do with the shooter. It‚Äôs trans visibility day, so they posted for that. The timing is just really horrible for everyone involved tbh"

"Doesn't that just lead to more polarization though? While personal communities should be prioritized, completely ignoring and flipping off other people's side is how we got to be so polarized in the first place.

Know your biases rather so that you can give people a fair chance. There‚Äôs never gong to be anyone without biases. But, knowing you inherently are going to trust someone of the same group as you is just as important as knowing you don‚Äôt trust those out of it too. If you trust all x - you‚Äôre a target for being scammed. If you avoid all y - you may be missing out on some genuinely wonderful people. If you purport to be bias less then, to me, you most likely have your own biases that you don‚Äôt know about and aren‚Äôt addressing."

"I think generally the old phrase ""respect is given, trust is earned"" meant that common decency ""respect"" was given first, but if you abuse it nobody will trust you enough to even do that.  That trust is earned by also being decent and upstanding toward others.

Today respect seems to be taken as ""acceptance"", which isn't what common decency is.  Common decency being treated as a human with dignity, but that all hinges on you to an extent.  If people don't know you they should generally be courteous and treat you with a modicum of respect.

If you show yourself to be unworthy of such decency by your rancid behavior...well that's on you and I have no sympathy for what befalls you."
"I went back to school, and I am now in my 30s, for business (6 classes left), and when I had business values classes, whew you‚Äôre right.

"No.

I think you may be confusing respect with politeness, and even still neither are owed.

Let me be very clear. Despite the fact that I may be a healthier person if I am polite before knowing you it is not an obligation. I would encourage people to be polite, but I will never demand it.

But respect is completely different. True, you may be wise to respect people upon first meeting them the same way you would respect a snake even before you know it is venomous, but that seems more like caution to me so I don't think ""respect"" is a fitting word. No you may have respect for a hero, or for authority, or for people who have done great things. You may have respect for your friends because you know who they are in their hearts, but these things are earned with the experience we have with the person."
Yeah the concept of basic respect is lost on these people. Why should I even have to be in the same room as a trans person. They make me uncomfortable! All this other bullshit so they can make up excuses to get rid of us and demonify us.
"I think you are confused on the words being used.

You may ""respect"" a person before you meet them the same way you would ""respect"" a snake before you know if it is venomous, but that is more like caution than respect.

Or rather you may feel obligated to be polite to someone simply because being impolite is considered a moral pitfall, but that's subjective and is a rule you've made for yourself, despite how wise it may be. Regardless, respectfulness and politeness are not the same thing.

It is difficult to define specifically but I think a good starting place is to say that respect is something that leaders have. If you respect someone you would follow them, and I hope you wouldn't follow people blindly."

I don‚Äôt use the word respect to mean fear, which would be a more appropriate word for your snake example.

I also don‚Äôt use respect to mean admire, which would be more appropriate for your leadership example.

When I say that human beings are deserving of basic respect and dignity, I am saying that I recognize and believe that all human beings are of equal innate value. The key operative word there is innate.

Sure, not everyone on the soccer team is equally skilled or contributes equally to the win or loss, but on a fundamental level, that doesn‚Äôt matter. Fundamentally, human beings are not to be valued for their instrumental utility, but for essentially being human.

No, this doesn‚Äôt mean everyone gets a trophy. In practical day to day worldly matters, we evaluate people based on outcomes, effort, growth, etc. All of those factors contribute to the added level of respect or dignity we place *on top* of the basic levels with which we already ought to treat everyone.

And no, I do not mean mere politeness, which is superficial, often insincere, and sometimes condescending.

I respect other people in part because they all have lives as rich and complex as my own, and I humbly accept that I do not have the capacity to fully and completely understand anyone. Yet, by striving to deepen my understanding, and accepting that life is about discovering truth, not mandating it, my appreciation and respect for people regardless of their station in life or particular attributes grows."
Respect used to be used more generally as a phrase that meant to give a certain amount of politeness and decency to a person you have never met because that is the mature way to act.  Mature people don't run around with paranoia or just trusting everyone willy nilly.  They give a modicum of respect until you either show you are a decent human and acquire more or you show you're a POS and lose all respect.

Declaring that people who have concerns over gender affirming care for kids (such as the effects of puberty blockers on kids, look up the case of Jazz Jennings, who is experiencing depression after transitioning for years because they did the surgeries way too soon) as hateful is not only hateful for you or others to do but it also makes people immediately discredit your arguments. 

Concern over the education and safety of kids should be more highlighted. Kids shouldn‚Äôt be coerced by radical activists masquerading as teachers to accept their ideologies. These ‚Äúteachers‚Äù need to stop pushing ideologies and either actually do their jobs or quit being a teacher. 

Plus the articles you linked are clearly biased with certain political leanings. Sources like Vox are not a reputable and it only discredits your argument.

Why are they salty over MTG? They have their own batshit crazy incompetent in AOC so we‚Äôre even. Chill.
She is legitimately in Congress‚Ä¶
Exactly. There are many 60 Minute interviews I think shouldn‚Äôt have happened. So what?  I‚Äôm not narcissistic enough to think my opinion is the only one that matters.
You should be more upset with David Hogg than MTG.
"At this point, if someone still doesn't think she's nuts, they hain't gonna give a shit about how she behaves during an interview."
Why is she a wack job?
"Oh, goodness, the irony of your comment is palpable."
"True, but they do shine a really bad light on their party to the world outside of the US. 
Seriously, you mostly get to see and hear those three in connection to the republican party and that picture is pretty bad."
What do you consider a legitimate news organization?
just shocked at the brain death of you dudes
No they‚Äôre not. They‚Äôre bemused and rolling their eyes
"As far as I'm aware, no one from the left has claimed that Obama won the 2016 election and that forest fires are caused by Jewish Space Lasers. 

Just sayin."
"Well I mean who are the main leaders in the Republican party, I respect all my fellow Americans opinions but its ok to be wrong. A lot of republican and democrat leadership have done crazy things its just Republican leadership has been going wild these past 7 years."
"Outrage porn is something that both sides are guilty of, sadly."
That‚Äôs just the entertainment portion. In real life we want the left gone completely.
That's because it doesn't take much for someone to say something that exposes the idiocy of the left point of view
Is this a serious comment?
"Right. Legitimate. The lady who said Jewish space lasers exist and who thinks trump won the election üôÑ

Edit: Spelling mistake"
I‚Äôd bet on Kari Lake before MTG for VP
Even though the overwhelming majority of media companies including CNN are owned by Conservatives.

As someone who builds these types of space technologies I don‚Äôt have any problem with her asking these questions. The lefties are just sick in the head."
">You should be more upset with David Hogg than MTG.

It amazes me how some people (right or left politics) can immediately go into attack mode and victim shaming by default.  I'm pretty sure David Hogg didn't wake up one morning and ask for his classmates to get shot up with an AR-15, 17 people killed, 17 wounded.

I don't agree with everything Hogg says, but he's more than entitled to his views.  

&#x200B;

Is the 1st amendment not a right for people who witness a massacre first hand?"
100%
Is palpatine ftfy.
That‚Äôs probably the point and why they‚Äôre some of the only conservative actors the media props up with endless partisan outrage coverage. These people have as much claim to sanity and reason as the AOC Omar obsessed cons.
Hillary‚Äôs been complaining about a stolen election for years after losing to trump..
They claim men can bear children and that roads are racist. Lunacy is not limited to MTG.
"I have dont know anything about MTG but in todays day I‚Äôm willing to be all the criticism is propaganda and nonsenses. I don‚Äôt know what ‚ÄúJewish space lasers‚Äù is all about, but as someone who works in the space industry I can tell you that you‚Äôd be silly to think Israel, like every other space faring nation, doesn‚Äôt have lasers in space. We even put a laser on the side of an AC-130‚Ä¶"
All these downvotes are proof
"She didn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúJewish Space Lasers‚Äù. She said Space lasers. As someone who builds space systems I have no problem with her asking the question about what that space tech might be used for. Much easier to light a fire with a cigarette, but not impossible to use a space laser to do it.

And I‚Äôm all in favor of a national divorce, it would be ideal, but I think civil war is more likely and probably the only real way we can resolve our differences as history shows."
"It probably is, given that, y'know, these types of people *do* exist"
He‚Äôs not a victim. He‚Äôs a shark.
Dew it!
"No one's claimed that lmao. 

Men transitioning to women, can get pregnant, at which point they are not a man but a woman."
Yeah lol.
">He‚Äôs not a victim. He‚Äôs a shark.

Most people who are narcissists operate in conspiracy theories.  Everything is a scam.  Everything is an angle.  There are no honest people only people scamming other scammers.  Narcissism is about threat detection.  If a person disagrees with a narcissist, the narc immediately goes into hypervigilance about seeing how they might be attacked or diminished, and they immediately respond with attacks to delegitimize the other party -- like calling Hogg a ""shark"".

If you have no respect for other people's views and can't meet an opposing person on the merits of their facts, evidence, and reasoned opinions, then maybe it isn't that your arguments and views are wrong.  It's that you can't accept that people have motives that aren't the same as a scam or an ulterior motive.  A narcissist can't argue the facts/viewpoints, so as a defense mechanism to defend their ego, they just assassinate the messenger.

A person who lives through a 35 person assault and massacre is entitled to grieve on their terms and respond to a tragedy on their terms, \*not yours\*.

He's entitled to his viewpoints.  If you can't disagree with another person on the merits, the problem is you, not him and it has nothing to do with guns or the 2nd amendment.  It's that you can't accept someone has a different viewpoint.  And that's what some people might call cancel culture."
"I know almost nothing about them, other than they sound like a conservative stereotype every time I see them covered somewhere against my will. Maybe I should educate myself a little before I do any more speaking on the subject.

Most genuine conservative voices, I think, come from people who are long dead, as conservativism ideal function is to conserve important aspects of the past that might easily be forgotten between generations. Dead popes, dead presidents, etc."
"No, they‚Äôre not."
Impossible...
Show me one case of a man transitioning and they became pregnant. I'll wait.
Stop spreading harmful misinformation.
"And this is why I can never vote Democrat.

What happened to safe, legal, and rare??"
Getting money without working for it. That‚Äôs what the Biden family does
Also using their political positions to enrich themselves at the expense of everyone else.
Exactly
Premiums will go up for everyone to cover the insurer's costs for these write offs.
"It's funny I was just talking to my mom about newer technology and the push for efficiency. All the newer appliances today claiming to be more efficient, having all these stupid new features don't last near as long as their predecessors. But it's supposed to be better for the environment and save everybody money. What happens to all this stuff when it's got to get replaced every five to seven years? It ends up in the dump right? How is that better for the environment when we're constantly buying and then dumping and then buying and then dumping?

I just got a new oil furnace because I have no gas on my street, with a heat pump. It's replacing a 40 year old furnace and 30-year-old AC unit. It's supposed to be way more efficient. I could tell you right now, while I may save money on oil, I don't get that nice warm air feeling like I did with my old furnace. It does the job but it'll probably last a fraction of what my old furnace did. And the heat pump thing as the alternative source for heat when it's a certain temperature, I'm not very impressed with it I'll tell you that. It was literally just installed so maybe my opinion will change but I doubt it."
"Yes, and it‚Äôs not like this stuff isn‚Äôt full of toxics; it‚Äôs  going to the most expensive landfills"
"Yup, oil is expensive and oil fired furnaces max out atound 80% efficiency. They can easily last 30 years before major repairs. Too bad you don't have access to natural gas, your efficiency would jump to 95% and cost per BTU would go way down. In my situation,  I have a 30 plus year old 80% efficient propane boiler, no access to natural gas, I could upgrade to a 95% efficient high efficiency boiler.. but it would cost 7k to install and then you need to spend 300 bucks a year maintaining it or risk your heat exhanger plugging up and junking your entire boiler. A new 80% efficient boiler would cost nearly a 3rd less and the loss in efficiency over a 95% is regained by not having higher maintanance and higher install costs. It woukd take 15-20 years to pay for itself and then you are reaching the point where repairs will be needed."
This is awful. Can‚Äôt even imagine someone so cruel is capable of doing this to a 2 year old.
This is awful. It breaks my heart
Truly sad.

I shouldn't be shocked that the DFL is part of the Chicago machine.

Yet Walz has done absolutely *nothing* about teacher pay.  It would take me like 8-15 years and 2 masters to match my first year school district's teacher pay in Texas if I taught at some school districts up in Minnesota.  Kay Ivey signed the TEAMS act, Abbott is offering bonuses for teachers that reportedly allowed a teacher of the year to make 6 figures and even the LEARNS act brought first year pay to $50k in Arkansas."

Apparently 120,000-150,000 people who somehow *still* think he needs their money."
Right on - I gave $100 instantly to show my support.    What the left is doing is NOT OKAY.   We need to send that message.
"some people donate as a political statement, it's the closest thing to voting outside of an election

only time I donated was after the first impeachment, I sent him $45

since then, he's sent me about 45,000 emails"
"I need my money. I'll take others'money if they freely give too. April fool's is my anniversary (24 years).

What does that say about me?"
Chill. He‚Äôs getting money from people who also don‚Äôt need their money.
Trump is going to drain that swamp!
"FYI, the resale value of those NFTs is now 10x what Trump was selling them for.  They had a better ROI than any actual professional investment lol"
It‚Äôs almost like he‚Äôs popular or something
"I did, 50$ cause he more than likely is going to be our next President again and he fights for us normal people. So giving to him is literally nothing compared to all the benefits we'll receive in the future with him as President. He'll fix our border problem(again), bring inflation down, regain the trust of our allies and make better trade deals. He'll also make us energy independent again which has been really hurting us middle class families under Biden. And I can't wait for him to expose that swamp once again. Great times ahead!"
"Stuff like this is why the left happily circlejerks and calls us a cult.

What do you think he‚Äôs doing with your $100? Where is it going? Does he really need it to defend himself? You can show your support or call this a politically-motivated indictment without dumping your bank account and not knowing where it‚Äôs going."
"If this is sarcasm, well played. If not, then hey, maybe if he defies all expectations and somehow wins, he‚Äôll do a 180 from what he did his first 4 years. The man made some great policy decisions, but draining the swamp was limited to publicly badmouthing people and then hiring them (or keeping them around)."
"No, it's not, lol. It‚Äôs the oldest scam in the book. It's called a pump and dump, and you're the mark."
">And I can't wait for him to expose that swamp once again.

Going to need some elaboration.....specifically when he exposed the swamp the first time."
Did you not read the article?   It‚Äôs support and encouragement.     $4M in one day with a $34 average donation and 25% first time donors.    Money talks louder than Reddit posts or votes that no one cares about.
"they haven't gone up 10x, but you can go on opensea and look at the price history yourself. looks like the average sale price is currently 2x what it was when they first launched"
"I didn‚Äôt buy any and if I did I would have sold already.

Not sure who you are accusing of orchestrating the pump and dump since Trump sold them months ago for 10% of their current value."
"Don't take it personally, they are upset that this will probably sideline desantis till 2028."

Not surprising. NM is one of our deepest blue states.

What's good for the goose is good for the gander
"Watching the GOP play nice is f-in NAUSEATING. We should have impeached Biden and if it failed, do it again. Same for Garland. And there should be massive PAC-led lawsuits against elected officials that spurred on Antifa and BLM riots in 2020. 

But sure, take the high road. Pretend we aren‚Äôt in a culture war."
What's good for the goose is good for the gander
I‚Äôll be a skeleton rotting away before Republicans do anything like this. They still have this idealistic version of these institutions.
"Well this right here is enough to jail Biden:

"The GOP is being idiotic by trying to take the high road.  Democrats are not going to stop with their tactics, they are in full scale war mode.  GOP has to respond."
I‚Äôll be over here holding my breath.
I will believe it when the MSM announces their indictments until then it's just fluff.
"There are many paths to follow when it comes to a criminal indictment of Biden: The Ashley Biden diary's salacious allegations, the influence peddling in foreign countries, the tax fraud... and that's just the start.

Unlike with Trump, it wouldn't take years of investigations to come up with anything, and there'd be no need to redefine terms of law or rely on criminal witnesses to bring him to court."
"I think that indicting Trump was an ""insurance policy"" against possible indictments of any criminals on the left because it gives them the optics to cry ""retaliation""."
It will never fly.  Biden isn't mentally competent.
"Has the Conservative threads been brigaded by Liberals? It seems like there are a lot of ""conservative"" accounts almost trying to cause a rift between the Desantis and Trump crowds with conflicting reports or stories. Also, there are always conservatives getting downvoted to high heaven, I never used to notice that until recently."
Obama also bombed a Pakistani wedding with innocent children present
"Brandon blew up an aid worker and a bunch of kids because he didn‚Äôt want to look bad for the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan leading to dead soldiers.

Blowing up kids must be popular among Democrats.  Can‚Äôt wait to see his charges too."
"Serious question. I googled this and Reuters reported that trump killed this kids 8 yo sister. Is this true? Reuters are kinda known for propaganda, did they have a real source on this I didn't find one."
That‚Äôs (D)ifferent.
"Dude, you're a day and a half behind the news cycle. That's been dead over a day now. They're going with Hawley's bill which just sanctions ByteDance. More than plenty to do the job there."

"Completely agree about Trump and Biden.  But just a historical note - Nixon didn't get off.  He resigned before what was an inevitable Impeachment and almost surely a removal from office by the Senate.  Ford later pardoned Nixon but I wouldn't exactly call that getting off, Ford did it so the country could move on."
Trump never even took a payday as President. But here they are fretting over which pocket he took the money out of to pay a harlot.
"I think there‚Äôs something that should genuinely be terrifying. Paying hush money is okay, as long as it‚Äôs from the correct budget.

I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it‚Äôs all technically legal. It doesn‚Äôt mean it should be but just look at insider trading and ask if they wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable with keeping holes open that allow them to position family members to reap foreign rewards for favourable behaviour?

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right - I‚Äôm worried it might be legal‚Ä¶"
Thing is- the payment is explicitly legal.
"Eh, lock them all up"
The point wasn't about horrific acts. The American killed probably deserved to die. But we have due process for American citizens. Just because you aren't on American soil doesn't mean your rights are suddenly no longer present. He assassinated an American without due process.
"Blowing up or blowing on. Either way, the Dems need to stop doing any blowing around kids."
"They also love killing them in the womb, too"
"and they called it a ""Righteous Strike"""
"So it was widely reported at the time but more recent reporting is ""unconfirmed"" so it's tough to say for sure.

I have little trust in the government and given everything else I wouldn't doubt it's real but yeah without more evidence to truly confirm it it's not something that can be made much of a deal about.

Pretty much only brought it up in the context of the other 2 which everything is confirmed and has had proper reporting."

"How many times a day do you break the law? You follow the average person around all day long, and you'll find them doing something illegal at some point. I find it very difficult to believe, that over Trumps long career, with all those businesses, in all those countries, and all those contacts, that this instance is the only time he's done something illegal. How does he develop all that land without kickbacks to mobs, cartels, or foreign governments? More accurately, that this single instance to a porn star matters. What's next, a jaywalking charge?

But, if this is the direction we're going to go now, microscoping every transaction, would you actually believe that the current swamp of politician in service aren't dirty? Those extreme powers of observation seem to be used, only in certain situations when it's convenient."
"Sure, if they're criminals like the Bidens and Hillary lock them up. Lock up criminals in either party for that matter, they don't get to live off our tax dollars when they should be in prison.  I don't think Trump is one of those criminals and they indicted him because they've been going after him relentlessly for years and also so that any charges brought against actual criminal leftists will result in ""retaliation"" cries like I mentioned."

"Yes, we're talking about the same thing."
"I mean, you're going to have to show me where the votes are coming from if you think it's not dead because I can't even got to 40 let alone enough to pass it. Almost no Republicans are going to vote for it and at least a third of the Democrats won't either."

2. White Supremacy 
3. Nazis

5. Terrorists

Disgusting double standards.
There is a war on kids happening. Don‚Äôt forget about the subject of all these outrageous antics. No child should ever be allowed to turn themselves into a carnival side show. No ‚Äúparent‚Äù should ever be allowed to persuade their ‚Äúchild‚Äù to become their science project. If we don‚Äôt protect these children from their mentally sick parental guardians, no one will. It should be a criminal offense and treated just the same as child abuse because IT IS CHILD ABUSE. 
Lastly any reference to ANYONE being ‚Äúunder attack‚Äù should be directed towards CHRISTIANS. Was it not 3 innocent Christian kids that were slaughtered a few days ago? Any sympathy given towards this deranged shooter or their affiliations should be treated as a potential on going threat against the Christian community. Don‚Äôt listen to statistics, they are easily manipulated. The blame is being pointed at everything except the actual problem. MENTAL HEALTH. Don‚Äôt believe the lies, they are meant to indoctrinate others. The 1% alphabet circus has a disease. Victimization is the largest symptom of this epidemic."
