LIBERAL,r/liberal,"Folks don't transition because cramps hurt...

Is that a strawman too?"
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Title is misleading. Makes it sound like 82% voted no, rather 82% did not vote. Either way the referendum fails, but they are not the same."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,This is facts
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"That makes absolutely no sense. Doesn't murder require premeditation? If anything this could be manslaughter, but given the context of self defense even that's bullshit."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"If meat can be grown on a cow, it can be grown in a petri dish as far as I'm concerned. If it tastes the same, nutritional value is the same, and costs the same, I'll eat it either way if it's put in front of me."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"The FDA has been anything but honest for the last few decades, so I‚Äôd prefer the ban."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,I think he means wealth distribution in a way. So if the Miners makes $25 and the YouTubers make $75 we should take $25 from them and give it to the Miners so everyone makes $50. No matter your skills or profession you make $50.
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,Thanks but I'm going with the actual prosecutors on this one. And Davis Petreous.
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Leftists absolutely hate cars, I'm convinced one of the main reasons isn't environmental, it's because they hate the freedom of choosing where you go when you want to go, they want you to be forced on a bus or train full of smelly homeless people that only goes where they want you to go."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,PAB definitely works - it's fantastically accurate.
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"I had to cut off all friends who are rabid Trumpers because the stress of being around them was unbearable. If they want to support (worship) him, that's fine. Unfortunately, most want to sing his praises and try to prove to you how great he is by repeating one crackpot 'fact' after another. My 3 sisters adored the Apprentice show and are all Trumpers. I told them that the moment his name is brought up in a conversation that I will leave. We rarely talk. I've made it very clear how I feel about Trump and the idiocy that was his presidency. As the Republicans get more threatening and crazy, I won't talk politics with any of them at all."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,Yes
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,Just one question. Does he spit or does he swallow?
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"That is a nonsensical argument. Take the Voting Rights Act, it was written because blacks were specifically targeted with attacks on their right to vote. Righting that wrong isn't reverse discrimination at all. And guess what, as soon as the conservative court rescinded it there have been renewed attacks which shouldn't be a surprise."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"This is how the left always is. First they defined equality as everyone getting the same opportunity (which I think we all agree with), now they want to define equality as everyone having the same outcome regardless of what they put in."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,the democrats have become masters at gaslighting - every bill they pass is really about something else - even the bi partisan tik tok bill is really just a power grab and not meant to protect American citizens
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"State schools are only able to operate because of the massive amounts of money they get from the federal government. If the federal government stopped giving states money for education, the state would have to make up that money themselves (through higher taxes) or shut down schools. I guarantee you any state constitution written to require funding public education will get an amendment ending that requirement the day federal funding stops."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Tell that to the Jews in Nazi Germany. Will of the people my butt. Even if the majority of people want something wrong, it‚Äôs still wrong."
LIBERAL,r/conservative,"Yeah, many of the people here will rightly estate that mass shootings are caused by poor coverage of mental health and then go make fun of a man's depression. That's big part of the fucking problem"
LIBERAL,r/liberal,Headline: Super bowl losing team hires company unfamiliar with football to recount the score.
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,Seems like the whole world has this problem
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"This scumbag's description of ""why Black men will become conservatives"" simply because Walker is Black is one of the most inherently racist things I've ever heard anyone say in the modern era.

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,They are blinded by their fear of trump
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,üòÜ ü§£ üòÇ
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"You may be able too but the mindset this guy has is wrong, he doesn‚Äôt mean to educate them, persuade them or have them benefit from the exchange at all. Instead he wants to humiliate and embarrass which in the end of the day will probably cause them to double down on their views, alienating the other side is how this country became so divisive, and he walks away with nothing but a few less braincells and a shallow feeling of pride in the end."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,Hold accountable = racist against whites.  This is how privilege look at things.
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,I follow powerlifting.  Crickets in the community.
LIBERAL,r/liberal,">Her response? ‚ÄúWackos on both sides‚Äù. What‚Äôs the equivalent coming from liberals in their eyes?


Her comment is a false equivalency, a logical fallacy.

And it's really difficult to change MAGA minds because they seem to think in various logical fallacies. 

It's like when they use whataboutism or strawman arguments. In their minds, those are reasonable arguments. Even though they are logical fallacies.

So it's a significant critical reasoning problem. You can't fix it for her."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"You can hire family for campaign work. Paid canvassing is kind of a ""whomever we can find"" gig, for instance."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"What ever happened to treat others the way you want them to treat you?  Be kind and understanding, but hold people to the standards you'd hold for anyone else regardless of anything else.  Accommodations can, and should, be made for people with disabilities, but how does that apply to being late?  I'd be happy to help give suggestions, but at a certain point people need to be held responsible for their own actions."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Well said. Woke easily replaces the absence of any disciplined philosophy of life.

You can go woke. It has all the depth of a junior high school dance."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"I hesitantly voted for him in 2016. I gladly voted for him in 2020. Now I‚Äôd begrudgingly vote for him in 2024 if he becomes the nominee. Because he keeps getting in his own way and his rhetoric alienates people (‚Äúabolish parts of the Constitution‚Äù DOES NOT jive with those who care about it). He‚Äôs not going to win hearts and minds of Independents or non-Republicans that aren‚Äôt already polarized.

Plus, he‚Äôs not going to overcome the current system. I say this as someone who believes fraud played a major part in the Safest, Freest, Securest Election Ever ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, what‚Äôs changed since 2020 to plug up the holes? Georgia‚Äôs the only state of 6 that shored up their election integrity or dialed back mass mail-in ballots. Why should we expect different results with the same candidates competing in a system identical to that from 2020?"
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,If they end up at the 5th US Circuit Court they're screwed.
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,Lol.  The propaganda machine is running at full power!!!
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Oh we‚Äôre WWWAAAAYYYYY past the point of no return on the one Bill.  Weaponizing the alphabet agencies against political opponents?  IRS auditing political dissidents?  Social media censoring political opponents?  And my favorite of them all‚Ä¶ impeaching a president that‚Äôs no longer in office. They literally impeached an empty chair.

There‚Äôs way way way more I could list of deeds to be returned in kind, and honestly it‚Äôs about time to go on the offense instead of taking it in the chin again and again.  If conservatives aren‚Äôt going to do what they promised they would do when running for elections of repeal, replace, and react to nonsense of the left, then being apathetic is just as bad as a participant, only it delays the inevitable."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,The suffering is the point.
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"Grab every person you know and beg, plead, drag them to vote. THIS YEAR. EVERY YEAR. Had to report a poster who suggested a Tran person set themselves on fire. That person shows up at EVERY election. At least do the same."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"I mean, how can you tell?  They do that all the time anyway."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,Take a picture of the bullet rides Biden cutout and send it to the Secret Service.
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"How do i know if im being ""hector""-d?"

CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,There ya go...I was thinking about borrowing a fire truck to drive around with siren blasting
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"Hell yea, I'm glad your in it to win it"
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,So awesome - still sad it‚Äôs even allowed but glad he mocked the bs
LIBERAL,r/liberal,I left Twitter last week.
LIBERAL,r/liberal,Ya thiank? The GOP clusterfuck in the House is just beginning. Party of losers.
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,As President. He served two terms already as Vice President.
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"No, don‚Äôt.  Just understand that Tucker and Co. are not the village idiots they sell to their viewers.  They know what they‚Äôre doing but they just do not care."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"The entire interview is worth watching, but he addressed a lot of questions.

LIBERAL,r/liberal,"Because if you don‚Äôt, he‚Äôll do everything in his power to make sure your vote doesn‚Äôt count."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,Where does it say he got charged with possession of a weapon...
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,He is a governor who has federal funds for specific reasons. And he doesn‚Äôt allocate money to pay for the reason. How many people applied for food stamps and they were approved in the state they lived a month before? Nothing changed but the state. And federal guidelines are not allocated by the states governor. Hmmm
LIBERAL,r/liberal,No. But we also can‚Äôt allow the right to say ‚ÄúSee everyone does it. It‚Äôs both sides!‚Äù When the ratio is literally 100:1
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"After dealing with an insurance company over a totaled vehicle, I don‚Äôt want to hear one word about ‚Äúinsurance‚Äù. And stolen cars are rarely recovered in drivable condition if they are recovered at all. The reason people are so willing to steal other people stuff is because the chance go getting caught is very low and even if caught the penalty is a joke. 

Basically if I was on the jury I‚Äôd vote not guilty. It may not exactly follow the law but the laws do nothing for victims."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,They them
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"1. I heard it on npr morning edition, with a speech from gov. Huchel saying exactly that abortion was and would always be legal until birth in ny state. I don't have a link and every likely google result is paywalled, but i tend to trust nor to at least tell me when they are lying to me(a reference to the early days of the Afghanistan invasion when they were ordered to quash a story but made sure everyone knew they had been ordered to quash the story they couldn't talk about anymore.

2. Fact, i have never spoken to a cis woman who didn't acknowledge that if it had been an option they would have considered it."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,I was planning on eating a shitty taco salad and shouting I LOVE THE MEXICANS. But every region has its own customs.
LIBERAL,r/conservative,"She didn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúJewish Space Lasers‚Äù. She said Space lasers. As someone who builds space systems I have no problem with her asking the question about what that space tech might be used for. Much easier to light a fire with a cigarette, but not impossible to use a space laser to do it.

And I‚Äôm all in favor of a national divorce, it would be ideal, but I think civil war is more likely and probably the only real way we can resolve our differences as history shows."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,You know that is coming next‚Ä¶trump won 2020 is the new allahu akbar
LIBERAL,r/liberal,That‚Äôs a fair line of reasoning.
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"No! It's Carter's fault!

LOL"
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,Adults who wear diapers and don‚Äôt actually need them should face a stigma.
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,Right. The individual has no responsibility.
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,">‚ÄúYou can always count on the Americans to do the right thing after they have tried everything else.‚Äù

Hungary and other conservative governments have already figured out how to get progressive rot out of their institutions, I'm sure eventually the GOP base will come around. You can see an inkling of this in Trump and DeSantis' rhetoric that would have been unthinkable a decade ago."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,It don't fit their agenda so why give it mention ?thays how the left works
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,ü§£ Governor Wal-Mart might carry the majority of votes from his family.
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,‚ÄúCBS staff not allowed to accurately portray the news‚Äù FTFY
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"Oh yes there is‚Ä¶ 

Jk Rowling is a perfect example ‚Ä¶ she has the mainstream position for Americans and almost certainly the left, but isn‚Äôt overtly liberal enough sh she has to be cancelled.. 

Same with the entire concept of a turf is not a real feminist. 

Agree with everything but the fringe, so they gotta go."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,I would deny committee assignments to every one of those members who voted present in the final vote.
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"Not surprising. I warned friends of mine in the LGBTQ+ community years ago( I have lived in this shit show since 2010 and have heard it ALL) This will continue to get worse. Voting seems like such a dumb thing to say, but these idiots vote. They get their kids and grandkids ballots ( have for years) and vote for them. Rural area. High crime but few arrests unlike in the city. Gerrymandering has screwed stuff up and will continue to do so. Boycotts? I wish I knew. So so sick of this."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,can you believe they were actually respected in the 80s
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"It *is* propaganda, and it makes you pay money to read it!  The least they could do is chalk up the 7 bucks a month to give that rag a veneer of legitimacy."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"They are like maggots, they just multiply!"
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"""If it becomes contested, the burden will be on the girl, the so-called girl, or the boy, to prove that he is a girl.‚Äù

Ok, Jennifer.  You're a bit taller than the other girls.  Drop those pants."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,All SCOTUS decisions from 1795 to 2008 agreed that the 2A was strictly about membership in a militia and not about individual gun ownership. But even Scalia in the 2008 Heller decision said that there can still  indeed be \*restrictions\* on individual gun ownership.   -- Unfortunately the media and even Democrats like Hillary Clinton decided to go with the  utterly wrong   claim that  2A was \*always\* and \*originally\* about individual gun ownership.
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"TRUMP wouldn't  stoop low enough  to call someone childish  names. With that eye roll, I think I sprained something."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"I am regularly 3-8 minutes late at my workplace... but I also rebuilt my department from the ground, fix everyone's problems, and keep my department productive. I also regularly work overtime to ensure the next shift can run smoothly (because they have smooth brains and screw stuff up constantly). As such, my boss never talks about my tardiness. Work hard and make yourself worth the trouble, and people tend to overlook the little things."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"Unironically, they don‚Äôt value your family at all."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"""Ending Apartheid was anti-white"""
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"I'm aware of the legalities involved.

Perhaps I should mark it /s.

I was being sarcastic.

I'm just sick of the same old same old from disgraced one term former President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice),__ his sycophants and lawyers.

Edit - Added last section about sychophants and lawyers."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"They also couldn't be bothered to show up after the Christmas Parade massacre. But they have had no problem showing up to visit the families of murders. This presidency makes Obama's look decent, and Obama sowed the seeds of all the division and corruption we see today."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"I‚Äôm a diagnosed ‚Äúnuerodivergent‚Äù and I don‚Äôt accept this. I struggle more than some but I prefer to rise above. When I fail at the above I don‚Äôt expect anyone to accept it or pity me because that‚Äôs demeaning

all this tweet accomplishes is enforcing a stigma, and it‚Äôs actually offensive"
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Because Trump was wildly successful as a president. He did what he said he was going to do, and he fought some hard-won battles to get that done. DeSantis, while he's done some amazing things as governor, it's apples and oranges. When you're governor of a state, there's very little actual opposition to what you do. There's no guarantee that DeSantis will be as good at being president as he has been as a governor.   


Worse, right now if Trump wins the presidency, we get him as president AND we get to keep DeSantis as the governor of a monumentally important key swing state. If DeSantis becomes president, we lose Trump entirely and we lose the governor seat of Florida, all on the hope that somehow DeSantis might be Trump enough to be an adequate replacement for Trump."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,About time
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"They shouldn't categorize this as ""Opinion"". This is confirming facts."
LIBERAL,r/conservative,Why do they even have police? Tell that to everyone!!
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"So what. You're not even in the US, so you are clueless as to what has changed in the USA."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,Communists not in to free speech.
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Impeach this turd.
All the proof is ALREADY there. 
Do it now. 
Close the Border.
Bring back energy."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,What kind of hate? I tend to be skeptical about these things.
LIBERAL,r/conservative,Yes that was the only reason we didn‚Äôt like himüòé
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"Really?  Trump kept his stolen documents in a pool house shed at Mar-A-Lago.  You really gonna say that that's not mishandling?

Furthermore... Obstruction often comes along with a string of other offences since it's behavior that guilty people engage in to attempt to cover up their crimes."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"This is EXACTLY the answer.  They'll pay the ones they have actually working for them MORE (not just talking about their excessive number of locations either), but there will be far less people staffing those operations.  Human capital has become too expensive for a lot of businesses in America now.  Some can press on through price hikes, which we've seen, but this doesn't work well for a lot of businesses.  Their entire business models are based on ""value"".  They rely on VOLUME to make up for the profit per ticket.  When and if the volume drops, the business goes into the toilet.  

It's a battle of the only the strongest, as it should be.  Trouble is, so many businesses are propped up by cheap borrowing costs and underpaying labor for the past generation.  A hard reset is needed for the US economy, and it's medicine that no one wants to take or be a part of."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"Historically it was owned by conservatives , now pretty much every relevant platform is dominated by liberals‚Ä¶

Perfect example would be jk Rowling and terfs. Large boycotts and being banned from multiple places when they just hold the same opinion as mainstream Americans, and almost certainly the same opinion as the average liberal."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,Because if there's one thing modern Republicans love it's getting to play victim.
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"If I had to choose between buying a beer for the guy/girl who dyed his hair pink and the guy who stormed the Capitol building for a wannabe Hitler, you know I‚Äôm gonna choose the pink-haired guy/girl 180% of the time."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,I always make it a point to call them anti choice instead of pro life because theyre not pro life in any way.
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,So is this how normalization of federal policing at the state and local level kicks into high gear?
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,Because he did nothing wrong
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,">The overnight worker, identified by cops as Moussa Diarra, 57, **was also hit with assault and criminal possession of a weapon charge** in the Saturday incident

Some are now saying this didnt happen, but this was reported in the linked article."
LIBERAL,r/conservative,"Not sure if that was tongue and cheek, but I'm a big fan of forests because they are fun for hiking and hunting in. If lab grown meat curbs grazing lands in favor of forest reclamation, I'm all for it. I hear the Amazon was a nice place but from my understanding folks are slashing and burning the hell out of it for fucking cattle grazing."
LIBERAL,r/conservative,"To be fair, the whataburger by my house is pretty gross too. Ya gotta find a good one. I‚Äôd take in-n-out over it. The fries taste super weird but it‚Äôs aways clean at least."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,Because it shows we don't do a good enough job informing voters about the alternative and contrasting it with our candidates.  We have a LOT to learn from this.
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,Freaks really want to talk about sex and dance in front of kids. Red flag much?
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,Vive la Pepe
LIBERAL,r/liberal,They need to act & stop discussing.
LIBERAL,r/liberal,I did once just to see how ridiculous Jeanine Pirro really is. Never again.
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,Fox News is 100% responsible for this
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,This dude needs to sue New York City and the state.
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"A lot of this is just teachers sending kids down the drug pipeline. The moment a kid lapses in attention or gets emotional they‚Äôre handed Ritalin or medication for depression. Their parents were so afraid of letting their kids outside I‚Äôm not surprised a lot didn‚Äôt develop a love of a sport or exercise. A fat mentally unstable 12 year old isn‚Äôt to blame for being that way, it‚Äôs the fault of their authority figures. By the time they reach that 17th birthday they don‚Äôt see it as a problem to be fixed. Why would they it‚Äôs who they‚Äôve always been."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Is trump corrupt? Absolutely. Hate to break it to you, your side is just as corrupt.  You need only look at Joe and Hunter Biden to see that.  To pretend it's only one side that's corrupt is delusional. Simply read a damn book about history 

Nothing is going to come of this case against Trump. If it didn't go anywhere at a federal level, it isn't gonna go anywhere at all."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,Conservatives have an extremely unhealthy obsession with George Soros. It‚Äôs like a weird fetish for you guys.
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"I shouldn't have to coexist with the person who wants me dead... although a conservative view on that would be ""anyone I don't like""."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,Folks here need to read the actual law as proposed. The judge was right. It's a first amendment nightmare and it's way too overreaching.
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,Stunning!!!!!
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,A government that does nothing is the best government. That‚Äôs probably why you‚Äôre getting downvoted
LIBERAL,r/liberal,We all knew he was a treasonist. This just confirms it even more. He wants to become an absolute dictator.
LIBERAL,r/liberal,Is 52 too old too?  Is the left-wingers out there gonna gripe that the Dems didn't pick someone in their 30s?
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"As far as I'm aware, in New Zealand a business can't file for bankruptcy, only individuals can file for bankruptcy.

A business can be forced to liquidate if it can't repay its creditors, but only an individual can declare bankruptcy to discharge certain debts.

[It's true that during the bankruptcy process](https://www.moneyhub.co.nz/bankruptcy.html) you're typically not allowed to be in a managerial position in any business, be self-employed, or join a family-owned business venture  (or at least you need to seek special permission from the relevant agency).

As for limiting the number of businesses a person can own, I'm not sure what the point of that its?

If someone's good at starting businesses and they're all healthy and profitable then why would you want to limit them from owning more? So long as there's no anti-trust issues then what's the purpose of this?"
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"The point is not to define it, so they can use it to attack anything."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,He knew.
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Not allowed by Who?  We need to know who is fucking with our News. Soros?  Biden?  The DNC?  China?  Yes, it is China and I'm sick of it."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Um, I dunno.  trump put his kids in charge of the middle east, and stole top secret documents.  Lindsey Graham, Ted Cruz and Lauren Boebert are just weasels.  And you cannot run candidates like Herschel Walker or Dr. F\*ing Oz and expect people to vote R. The overturn of Roe v Wade may fit your religious agenda, but it wasn't popular.  Banning books.  Getting all worked up about someone's sexual orientation.  At least implying that you would throw Ukraine to the wolves and perhaps abandon NATO. Massive government debt accrued under Republican leadership.  The list goes on.

I'm an actual conservative.  And I have no love for Nancy Pelosi; but trumpism has made it damn hard to vote R in many cases.  Look at a candidate like Hickenlooper from Colorado.  A pro business guy who is sane, and he is a Dem.  And if the Dems keep the senate it checks the massive problems associated w/ trump getting a second term (if it had happened).  Hick is an easy pick.

The Republicans need sane candidates.  trump, Walker, Oz et al don't fit that bill.  So they lose.  And similar candidates will lose next time.  People vote party, until the clown show shows up."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,">Chomsky's heydey has long since passed.

CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,‚Äúwoke‚Äù is used an all of the above slur when conservatives say it.
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Destabilization is a prerequisite for radical reform, and they‚Äôre fairly open about ‚Äúradical reform‚Äù being their long-term goal.  They want to effectively invalidate the Constitution and radically change our nation into something unrecognizable."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,Now do Trump.
LIBERAL,r/liberal,Again?  Are the three people who voted for her last time still interested?
LIBERAL,r/liberal,This is the best comment so far in my opinion. No disrespect to anyone else but you fucking nailed it.
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"I love California. Beautiful weather, beautiful state. But it is so sad to see that elites living there who prospered due to its location are now making it impossible to live in because of the bad governance. We can see it being ruined right in front of our eyes. There are many who can't move out for various reasons and they are probably sad and extremely frustrated with the way things have gone. Several decades ago, this was the place to move to. Maybe one day it can return to its past glory after it hits rock bottom and the elites decide to abandon it."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,That ain‚Äôt no lie. It‚Äôs sad we‚Äôve made life a little to easy sometimes on our kids. Not me of course. üòä
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"I'd like to have a deeper understanding of your comment. If you care to, would you elaborate?"
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"I love Pete Buttigieg. He‚Äôll make a good president someday. I don‚Äôt think Buttigieg would have been able to accomplish getting senior citizens on Medicare the $35 monthly insulin cap. He doesn‚Äôt have the decades of experience, wisdom, and Rolodex of Capitol Hill relationships that Biden does. He knows how the sausage is made, and would probably make a joke about how he‚Äôs so old that he *invented* the sausage.

I voted for Elizabeth Warren in the primary, and with hindsight I can now see that Biden is the perfect person for president right now.

Look at what else he‚Äôs making a priority:

https://www.npr.org/2023/01/02/1146045412/biden-diverse-federal-judges-women-black-appeals-courts

His accomplishments are progressive. He wants to make this world a better place.

https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/biden-signs-historic-climate-bill-as-scientists-applaud/

If the oldsters would move the hell out of the way? Buttigieg, Swalwell, and other young people ran against Biden. Clearly people didn‚Äôt want him to move out of the way."
LIBERAL,r/conservative,A good start.  We need to reinvent the world without woke.

What‚Äôs to say DeSantis wouldn‚Äôt do well in any of the northern Rust Belt states? I get that the data with blue collar workers is minimal but Trump attracts a *ton* of anti-voters and did abysmally with suburban women; I think DeSantis should objectively do better in both categories. DeSantis also did so well in his re-election in Florida (won Miami-Dade by 11 points and Southeast Florida outright) that one has to think he can attract *some* moderate voters that Trump wouldn‚Äôt.

Also, isn‚Äôt Trump anti-woke, too? Dude literally said ‚Äúeverything woke turns to shit.‚Äù"

Biden probably is disgusted congress does nothing because I do feel the migrant issue IS getting worse but Biden isn‚Äôt going to just extend a policy he and his party have been vocally against.

LIBERAL,r/liberal,Shock Doctrine by Naomi Klein
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"According to the law and the US Constitution, as it currently stands?

No. 

The use of the word ‚Äúinsurrection‚Äù to describe the 6 January 2021 explosive destruction that took place towards our U.S. Capitol __isn‚Äôt just a word.__ It clarifies explicit constitutional consequences and effects. Serious enough to be detailed in our US Constitution. 

>*Section 3 of the 14th Amendment prohibits the election or appointment of an individual to state or federal office if they previously held such an office, took an oath of office and then ‚Äúengaged in insurrection or rebellion against the [United States], or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.‚Äù Adopted after the Civil War, the amendment precludes any insurrectionist who has served as a member of Congress, state legislator, U.S. military officer or federal or state officer from serving again.*

Honestly? 

That __sounds exactly like__ what one term twice impeached former President Trump did. __He does not need to be convicted__ in order for *Section 3 to be implemented.*

>*One point of agreement, including by the¬†judge in Greene‚Äôs case, seems to be that a criminal conviction is not required for an individual to be disqualified by Section 3.*

The whole time it was over the US it had the new U-2 variant over top of it and other data snoopers around it at all times. This was a windfall for us. They were no doubt looking at nuclear sites and bases. But we knew exactly were it was at all times so we just buttoned up and reduced emissions when they got close. There isn't much info the balloon could have collected that a satellite couldn't have. Now we on the other hand got to monitor in real-time the Chinese emissions and signals. We knew the exact time and location of all transmissions and what signals they sent at those times. The Chinese are going to have to change there ciphers and data collecting means now that we have a good idea how the operatate. If they don't them the are morons and opening themselvesup to exploitation. And in addition we got the parts after we shot it down. We are gonna have a good look at how they set up there electronics things like there EM collection and camera technology so we can exploit any design flaws. They should after this make big changes but who knows. I know we conservatives like to criticize anything the government or military is involved in but this is a rare we shouldn't.

Germany being a kind of defacto leader of the EU, this would mean other countries would perhaps follow suit.  The attack on the pipeline basically ended this possibility.

So while the midterms were disparaging, there was no red wave, and we narrowly lost the house because of the gerrymandering. 

While I understand your concern about DeSanctimonious, I don‚Äôt think he has national appeal. He is too extreme for the independent voters. Also, assuming he even enters the race, it‚Äôs going to be a long and bitter primary election because of Trump.

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Imo it‚Äôs actually deeper than that, it shows how many on the left view the rule of law and the judicial system more broadly. They don‚Äôt believe in equal justice under the law or innocent until proven guilty, they only view court decisions as a way to legitimize their pre existing beliefs. 

The parallels between how they view courts and how the Nazis viewed courts are undeniable. 

[People‚Äôs Courts - Nazi Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Court_(Germany))

> The proceedings of the court were often even less than show trials in that some cases, such as that of Sophie Scholl and her brother Hans Scholl and fellow White Rose activists, trials were concluded in less than an hour without evidence being presented or arguments made by either side. The president of the court often acted as prosecutor, denouncing defendants, then pronouncing his verdict and sentence without objection from defense counsel, who usually remained silent throughout. The court almost always sided with the prosecution, to the point that, from 1943 on, being brought before it was tantamount to a death sentence. While Nazi Germany was not a rule of law state, the People's Court frequently dispensed with even the nominal laws and procedures of regular German trials and is therefore characterized as a kangaroo court.[2]

> **There was no presumption of innocence nor could the defendants adequately represent themselves or consult counsel. A proceeding at the People's Court would follow an initial indictment in which a state or city prosecutor would forward the names of the accused to the Volksgerichtshof for charges of a political nature**. Defendants were hardly ever allowed to speak to their attorneys beforehand and when they did the defense lawyer would usually simply answer questions about how the trial would proceed and refrain from any legal advice.

>The People's Court proceedings began when the accused were led to a prisoner's dock under armed police escort. The presiding judge would read the charges and then call the accused forward for ""examination"". Although the court had a prosecutor, it was usually the judge who asked the questions. **Defendants were often berated during the examination and never allowed to respond with any sort of lengthy reply.** After a barrage of insults and condemnation, the accused would be ordered back to the dock with the order ""examination concluded"".[citation needed]

>After examination, the defense attorney would be asked if they had any statements or questions. Defense lawyers were present simply as a formality and hardly ever rose to speak. The judge would then ask the defendants for a statement during which time more insults and berating comments would be shouted at the accused. The verdict, which was almost always ""guilty"", would then be announced and the sentence handed down at the same time. In all, an appearance before the People's Court could take as little as fifteen minutes.

Edit: corrected wording"
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,welp had to figure it would happen eventually.
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"A large percentage of NY voters agree that Rep. Santos needs to go.

>*Democrats, independents and Republicans all agree - Rep. George Santos has got to go. A new poll found that 66 percent of New York voters across the state believe the Long Island Republican should resign from Congress, according to the Siena College Research Institute Survey. That‚Äôs up from 59 percent last month.*

Independents, Democrats and Republicans want Rep. Santos to leave.

>*While 72 percent of Democrats want him out of office, so do 63 percent of independents and 58 percent of Republicans.*

Rep. Santos has really found a way for everyone (except Rep. McCarthy) to agree on unanimously.

>*""The ‚Äògood‚Äô news for Santos is that even in these hyper partisan times, he‚Äôs found a way to get Democrats, Republicans and independents to agree about a political figure. The bad news for Santos is that the political figure they agree on is him, and they overwhelmingly view him unfavorably,‚Äù said Siena College pollster Steven Greenberg.*

Not only elected officials? But voters are tired of his antics.

>*Voters also dislike Santos. Some 64 percent of them view him unfavorably, up from 56 percent in January.*

Rep. Santos lied so many times that he will be investigated for a long time.

>*He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in a Long Island swing district last November based on a largely fabricated r√©sum√©. He‚Äôs facing investigations by state, federal and international agencies on a range of potential crimes from campaign finance violations to pet charity fraud.*

So? You wrote a fake resume?  That's all you did?

>*Santos insists he merely embellished his r√©sum√© and never broke any laws.*

Rep. Santos campaign is eerily reminiscent of one term (disgraced) former President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice.__

>*Maybe George Santos‚Äô real problem is that he aimed too low. While the newly elected New York congressman is facing calls from some in his own party to step down after revelations that he fabricated much of his life story in his campaign, a fellow New York Republican seven years earlier ran on an even larger raft of lies. Voters made him president.*

The snowball of criminal activity and abhorrent behavior is running down hill, gaining momentum and debris along the way. 

Far surpassing anything any one of us could ever have imagined.

Everyone is up in arms about police reform, and while I‚Äôm not going to argue no changes are necessary, I will argue the focus needs to be on judicial reform in regards to judges and DAs. Imagine how many people (career criminals) would be alive today, the millions of less victims, and the billions in property damage that would have been spared if only people were actually sentenced properly for their crimes. I locked up a guy last month for my third time for burglary in two years. He‚Äôs been arrested by my agency alone 6 times and another 7 times by the county for felonies during that time span. He‚Äôs still on parole and probation from a 1983 armed robbery/murder. I‚Äôve taken four firearms off the guy in two of those arrest. Yet he‚Äôs still walking free right now. His rap sheet was about 67 pages last time I checked‚Ä¶ but if he decides to fight us and he gets hurt or killed after trying to kill us, we‚Äôd be in national news dealing with riots. It amazes me how people out on bond awaiting multiple trials with conditions not to commit another crime (while currently on probation) do not get their probation or bonds revoked. Judges and DAs have ruined our country and have absolute immunity- meaning they can purposely do wrong and have no consequences. Meanwhile, cops get thrown under the bus with qualified immunity (meaning if they did wrong, they don‚Äôt qualify). The best anyone can do is vote for a new judge and DA every cycle."

Here's some options, to name a few:

1. Get on medicine and/or counseling.
2. Find a job where you can have a flexible schedule out of the house or at home, one that pays you for what you get done, no salary. That might be an incentive. 
3. If those don't work, try getting on disability. But that probably won't happen unless your doctor renders you untreatable or unable to work due to mental issues. I'm sure there are cases like that, and I'm not against it if a doctor honestly says there's no other options.

Make verified identities a dark blue and twitter blue a light blue or something. They're things that if you pitched them to me I'd be able to tell you is a dumb idea.

Leftists openly say that they don't play by the rules because they want an entirely new system to be put in place, so they see no reason to respect the system that it is already in place. It's literally a core tenant of Marxism to do everything in your power to subvert the system in place to bring it down.

But again, they're not necessarily meant to be ""arguments."" How we govern ourselves should not be confined to thinking in terms of tribalistic ""debates."" It's not a sport. It's real life. It should be holistically considering what provides for the best protections and benefit of all people.

They could be arrested on their way to Parliament to prevent them from voting against the King's interests, and so on.

That being said as leftist governments do not get their way, in the future, I'm afraid the quorum requirement will be removed.  

If you disagree with something, you need to go vote No, not just assume enough other people will vote no for you. This diffusion of responsibility is going to end up killing any chance for center or right leaning voters, policies, and ideas if we don't pay attention."

LIBERAL,r/liberal,"The far right is having a hard time finding their underdogs to pick on these days. 

Cultural rhetoric picked up and did away with being able to continue being openly bigoted 

80s-African Americans. Civil rights wasn't really over, but mainstreaming AA culture to America through television and the first real generation of post civil rights kids, being bigoted against blacks turned into a very bad thing.

90s- Women- sexism and open misogynism really started to gain attention. Clarence Thomas and sexual exploitation of women in and out of the workplace started to move equal rights for women into the mainstream. Women who had careers were starting to be seen as normal, not mannish. 

00's - Middle East- the beginning of the 00's had open bigotry and hate towards anyone from that region of the world out and in style based on political manipulation of 9/11. It took over a decade of that for people to start learning a little more about the region. Still a easy target though, but these days our culture at least pretends to be more sensitive to Muslims. 

10's- Homosexuals finally got rights to marry and be miserable too. The F word went completely out of usage. Try as they might, the right just couldn't stop the overwhelming support for LGB equality, or at least way more than had been in prior decades. 

Where else do you find a group of people that are easy to pick on, often misunderstood, and not part of a major group of influence in the US? Trans! The Christian fascists can so easily manipulate the public's perception of transgendered and transexual people- and they're a small group, no money, power or influence, and can't fight back.

Trump is the only Republican in a few decades to win any of WI/MI/PA, and even in 2020 he was within a few % points of all 3 states. He has more appeal to that white working class rural base, which DeSantis may not really have 

Those WWC rust belt voters are usually more socially moderate and economically populist. So the fear is that someone like DeSantis who is strong again the anti-woke stuff won‚Äôt appeal to them as much, and he‚Äôs more of a traditional conservative on issues like trade while again protectionist Trump may be a better fit for that region 

Overall I still think there‚Äôs a lot of great arguments for desantis and against trump too, but from electoral math perspective we NEED to win at least one of WI/PA/MI to have a chance even if we secure GA/AZ/NV still. So I think the best argument for trump is he just has a special emotional connection with those rust belt voters which transcends normal policy debates or whatever, since emotion always motivates voters more anyway"

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Rent control is known to be bad economics. However it is usually politically successful because most people don't understand even basic economics.

When this was tried in Hong Kong, landlords would intentionally vandalize their properties late at night to make them unlivable, forcing the tenants out so they could demolish the building and sell it for commercial or industrial purposes where they could actually break even or turn a profit since rent control causes them to lose money.

In NYC, landlord arsons became so common that burned-out tenants were given special welfare allowances -- a government failure in reaction to a government failure, which incentivized the *tenants themselves* to commit arson.

If interested, you can read more in:

* *Zoning, Rent Control, and Affordable Housing*, by William Tucker
* *The Ecology of Housing Destruction*, by Peter D. Salins

What it would really boil down to is state Representatives in the House and Senators in the Senate passing budgets to secure the funding, and possibly passing a law requiring the federal government to continue funding state level education. 2 problems with this -
1. States historically have fought hard against national standards for education. If the federal government is going to be bound to provide money for education, you can bet they're going to insist on a national standard curriculum. There's no way this country would ever be able to agree on any of that. 
2. Our Congress can't manage to get much done when it's ONLY in the interest of helping the general public. This is especially true when Congress is split and it requires a majority of both parties to get anything done.

Second, mob bosses like Trump know how to put a layer of plausible deniability between themselves and the people who can be thrown under the bus.  Most crime in this realm have to show knowledge and intent.  That is more difficult to prove.  


Third, Trump is politically high-profile.  The cult of the Republican base - noteworthy for their top-notch cognitive dissonance skills - and their Republican enablers will make prosecution inherently political.  Their case *must* be very solid.  Anyone going after a high-profile Republican should expect reprisals from the increasingly authoritarian Republican Party.

He showed them for the corrupt people they really are and now they want to shut him down along with people like Taibbi (a liberal), Bari Weiss, Lee Fang, and authors Michael Shellenberger, David Zweig and Alex Berenson.  The establishment in Washington doesn't like the boat being rocked, and the defense contractor lobbyists along with Wall Street are the ones calling the shots and they hated Trump because he was a wild card.

I'm for Trump again, I was on the fence and like DeSantis and will vote for him if Trump is out.  DeSantis has his own issues that will come out soon enough and I don't think he's a real outsider."

Just saying that if homeless people are a threat to public safety, pushing them out of an area only spreads the issue outward and doesn't provide any overall improvement.

CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"Well, I think you are missing the point that they are minding their own business. So it's like you're standing on a hill shouting at somebody who is not even anywhere near your hill. And calling them stupid."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"Worth mentioning:

NewsMax, presumably profiting from the advertising they show, used to offer it's feed to DirecTV for free.  Recently, they decided to charge DirecTV tens of millions of dollars on a regular basis for something they were getting for free up to a few weeks ago.

DirecTV made the business decision that not enough people watch that channel or subscribe to their service in order to watch that channel to pay NewsMax the new fee they were asking for.

This wasn't a political decision at all.  It was a business decision.  If NewsMax offered DirecTV their channel again for free tomorrow, presuming a contact of sufficient length so as not to have face demands for tens of millions of dollars all over again this time next year, DirecTV would probably air it.

Now, some satellite or streaming providers may air, just as Directv aired NewsMax when it was provided for free, similar free-to-the-cable/satellite/streaming-company stuff that may have minimal numbers of viewers and a minimal production value from the left wing as well as the right wing.  I think The Young Turks have a channel they offer around that is basically their left leaning radio show on television, and it's probably free to carry (I'm guessing.).

Channels like that often have low production values and even lower ratings, but they allow carriers to advertise that they have a much larger number of channels than they otherwise could advertise having, without spending a dime on some of said channels.

That's how you get all the odd religion channels that sometimes seem to be one long telethon trying to get people to send the preachers and their channels money, or that push a very politicized right-wing version of Christianity, or both.  Those channels approach the satellite company (Or whomever) and say ""Want a free channel that you can add to your channel count that will make the five people that call you every year saying they want to watch it very happy?"" and the satellite/cable/streaming company says ""Sure, why not?  We'll put it somewhere between channels 900-999 in our lineup."" (or wherever).

Some of the shopping networks get carried the same way.  In fact, it would not surprise me at all if some of the shopping networks actually paid the carriers to get placed in their channel lineup instead of usual situation with more popular channels, which is the other way around.

Conservatives who consider that censorship either don't understand the television business or are pretending not to understand the television business.

As the party of big business, you'd think that the Republicans would be all for market-driven decisons like this."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,Boycott those companies.
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"I did bankruptcy work for a couple years.  Half our cases were landlords who owned a couple properties.  Their mortgages were fixed monthly expenses.  Their property tax valuations were the issue.  Most of the landlords had a thin margin between what they were covering for their fixed expenses and what they took in for rent.  Their wealth creation was from paying off the mortgage, not a monthly income stream.  When their monthly tax obligations went up by a couple hundred it was not possible to transfer the expense over.  When rents for your units are 550-600 a month (this was a couple decades ago), it's not possible to raise those rents over 800.  If it was, they would have been doing it already.

The idea there are a bunch of rich people who own properties and they can all afford to pass their wealth on because a tenant decides to quit their good paying job for something easier, or a tenant that went into credit card debt for new stuff is typical leftist bullshit. 

I'm sure there are rich landlords in the city, or Albany, or where ever.  I'm also sure there are tens of thousands of landlords who aren't rich and who are just getting by.  They put their life long saving into buy a couple homes to rent, or they put their mother-in-law property up for rent when she passed.  That's how the average guy gets ahead in life.  It's not by footing the bill for some loser who has shit priorities.  I guarantee you there are a lot of losers out there who could pay rent and they chose not to."

If you don't trust ""government"" (and what does that even mean considering there's millions of people working at the local, state, and federal level who are honest and do good jobs to keep the country running), then it's up to **you** to get involved and work in good faith to fix it, not to tear it all down.

No wonder we are getting authoritarianism in the USA. Did you know kids now have to wear an ID at all times at school? They get in trouble if they don't have it. I never had an ID. Never needed one either. It's a joke, we're teaching kids that authority should be monitoring them at all times. No wonder they all have anxiety, big brother is always watching"

Remember his debate with Hilary when she called him out back in 2016?? He replied saying he is using the loopholes that are legal and put in place by the politicians, he then told her to close the loopholes but followed up saying he knows she won‚Äôt because she too uses those same loopholes but more importantly her huge donor billionaires enjoy those same loopholes so she‚Äôd need to screw them over. And that‚Äôs why she won‚Äôt and that‚Äôs why No Politician will close them. And again, it‚Äôs not illegal, we just don‚Äôt use the system as we can‚Äôt afford the lawyers and finance people to make it worth it in the end.

It‚Äôs similar to how Elizabeth Warren pointed out how many rich get around the taxes by taking low salaries and get compensated in stock, but if you don‚Äôt cash out then you don‚Äôt pay capital gains, so they take out HUGE loans and use stock as collateral and in the end pay almost no tax in the end plus all the huge write offs."

LIBERAL,r/conservative,"Yall just can't stop thinking about trans people, can you?"
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"It was not some sort of collective intentional decision, more of cultural shifts. Free speech also means different things to different left and different right

Oversimplifying a bunch of things in the mix for some degree of brevity, and I'll attempt some order but it won't be a neat timeline due to so many things overlapping -

* Libertarian right tends to think marketplace dynamics lead the best outcomes, and freedom of speech as analogous to a marketplace of ideas. 
* Socialist and progressive left does not consider marketplace dynamics conducive to generating the best outcomes. 
* Liberal left is closer to libertarians, but with more reservations.
* Left is generally more sensitive to speech purportedly demonizing minority groups, broadly considering more forms of speech harmful of this category.

--
* What kinds of contexts freedom of speech ought to apply to, and to what extent, is broadly disputed.
* Freedom to manage private associations depends on capacity of communities to police members speech, and reject members on basis of it.
* Anti-discrimination tends to conflict with freedom of association in many contexts, and certain kinds of speech can be a basis for discrimination.
* Religious right was considerably more interesting in censorship of certain forms of publicly available content.
* The left tended to include people who were inclined to express speech contents the religious right found objectionable.

--
* 80s happened, and the religiosity of the right declined significantly while libertarian ideologies mixed more with other forms of conservatism. 
* The internet happened, and political discourse began moving increasingly online, despite much of it being technically in private spaces it was effectively public.
* Online content was a gray area regards companies being responsible for content put on their sites by users, which would become a liability.
* Online content was generally not very regulated, and was curated more by algorithms than people, those algorithms favoring content that was provocative.
* Political vitriol was generally increasing in politics, online and off, and political advertisement and propaganda online expanded into many big forum spaces.

--
* Socialist and progressive left had begun to dominate youth culture more than ever before, which ended up influencing the way companies navigated this.
* A handful of major conservative figures had found ways to appeal to youth online, while facebook was relatively good in terms of reaching older people.
* MAGA events lead to a dramatic increase in scrutiny of online content and censorship, undermining to some extent conservative online movements.
* Generally speaking, more right wing political content producers ended up attracting negative attention, on top of fears of foreign propaganda growing.
* Big tech companies found themselves at the center of these political tensions and catching the attention of the government and public, siding with the left/youth.

--
* Younger generations were very frustrated with politics, with relatively little power over traditional political institutions.
* MeToo movement made one form of power youth had clear - to affect cultural instead of institutional change by assassinating people's character online.
* Freedom to not associate with the right, and the ability to affect politics by online movements becomes a key part of their toolkit.
* Younger left are now far less positive toward free speech, and view cancel culture more as consequence culture.
* The right is aware they're failing in terms of youth appeal, hence the culture war dynamics moving toward education issues as well as the internet.




All these dynamics and more contributed to changes in different right and left leaning groups of people over time. I don't think you can narrow it down to single factor, and if you lump all the right and all the left into two big camps they will each seem to have contradictory views, but they really each break down into several smaller camps, even beyond the bigger ones I mentioned."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"No, this is exactly why politics matters. This man and his cohorts vilifiy lgbtq people at every turn. This highlights the real world consequences of that kind of campaign. They‚Äôve spent an awful lot of time, money and energy categorizing these people as less deserving of dignity and legal protections as everyone else‚Ä¶this result plays out time and again in families all over this country."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"I think they're getting more confident they can cut him loose like some of them wanted to do in 2016. If they can, and try to get back to their more traditional forms of power retention with leaders who don't say the quiet part out loud and they can just collect money with less drama, they absolutely will go for that. 

My opinion is that almost nobody truly loyal to Trump has any governmental power. Everyone near him that's actually got political power are fine with him as long as he is good for them, nothing more, nothing less. I think all his true followers and real admirers are just people on the outside of the systems."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,What a crock of shit.
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"It would work if we had honest DA‚Äôs that could be trusted to apply the law equally, fairly and a-politically.  Instead what we got was a bunch of Soros-backed sycophants that use ‚Äúprosecutorial discretion‚Äù as an excuse for applying a legal double-standard to political opponents. 

And it‚Äôs not just guys like Trump that are affected, but the entire community served by these DAs.  Hardened criminals are walking free in NYC because Bragg is too busy chasing after Trump instead of going after actual criminals."

It‚Äôs more work for me than others but it is my job. In school, sure I can get accommodations like extended due dates/test times or a note taker because I‚Äôm in an environment specifically made for learning. But when I am doing a job where other people specifically rely on me‚Äîwhen there are customers and coworkers who need my work to progress, that‚Äôs on me.

Traditional ideology is what holds us back from our next evolution as a species.. it'll be what ends the human race in my opinion of course."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Huh?

Nobody thinks people who do good things can't do bad things. It's been a damn long time, and I haven't really heard any movement that is ""doomed to repeat"" what Gandhi did, aside from the good principles he championed.

Oh shut up with that crap, the rate of priest child molesters is lower than that of the general population, especially in the past 20 years after the Church made drastic reforms in the 90s.  That's why most cases you hear about are from the 70s and 80s.  

Meanwhile a story about a union-backed public school teacher pedo comes out every other day.  Not only that, but the left as a whole is pushing sexuality on children of ALL ages, then persecuting parents who come out against it from it being actively taught in the school system."

Inclusivity is fine when it doesn‚Äôt conflict with logic, but when it does it just becomes counterproductive and even down right harmful because look who we are giving the car keys too!! 

Republicans."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"They truly hate conservatives, but I think they they nor only completely misunderstand what conservatives are and how they think (the ole conservatives are evil) but they don't even get the evolution of politics.  For example they often go on about how they can't wait for all these evil old conservatives to finally die without realizing they are being replaced by new people becoming conservatives as they age.  Most people start out left leaning and become more conservative as they age, but another thing is that people have goals and when those goals are achieved they will tend to stop and usually that means becoming conservative.  For example loads of people could have been roped in with the progressive antislavery camp but once slavery ended many effectively flipped conservative because they did not care to push further social reforms.  

The liberals seem to think that they can ""win"".  Nobody can just ""win"" the game of politics there will just be new things to be pushed for and against."

I'm sorry to break it to conservatives that think the deficit is the most important issue. Americans by and large don't care and will react negatively to any serious effort to address it. There isn't enough responsibility among the general population and you can see it among our culture (most Americans live way outside their means).

Tax increases do not fix it. Laffer curve and global economy. People are tapped out, there is no excess money floating around and our economy is almost in a stagflation.

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,That‚Äôs a singular study how can I even tell if it‚Äôs peer reviewed?
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"It's not even tough.

Individually, it's hard to predict a person's behavior or health outcomes.

But when you gather that data and combine it with hundreds of millions of other people... Things get really predictable really quickly.

Death is the easiest thing to look for because we have a nice system in place to track it, Most deaths, it's usually pretty easy to know what somebody died of, and it's final.

So we know that the rate of deaths for the entire country for car accidents is x per 100,000 in January... The rate of deaths for cancer is y per 100,000 per year. etc, etc, etc. It doesn't change that much year to year. It just doesn't. It's frighteningly predictable.

And when you just look at all-cause death rates year after year, it's basically a metronome. So when you see your overall all-cause death rate spike right as a new thing that can kill people is happening, you can be pretty damn sure that the new thing that's killing people is the cause of those increased deaths, regardless of what it says on any death certificate.

People want to think they're individuals, and nobody can predict the future, and that they get fat because of their genetics, and that they're special because their mommy said so. But, at least when it comes to statistics... nobody's special.

What the heck do these people think a death certificate is FOR? If not to track what people in the country are dying of so as to try to stop those deaths that can be stopped?"

Then the next year they raise your rates. And so on."

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"They have Jets. The Russians also have a metric fuckton of SAMs and AAA(IADS). The Russian air force is having the same problem with Ukrainian IADS.  This is leading to neither side being able to impact the war in a major way from the air. 


&nbsp;

 In the gulf war the USAF and USN were able to overcome a similar situation with overwhelming airpower and airborne electronic warfare combined with drones, stealth aircraft and cruise missiles. Neither side in the Ukraine war is capable of that level of operations or has the advanced technology required in anywhere near the required amounts. The Ukrainians simply don't have the equipment and while the Russian air force has it on paper they have shown themselves to be rather incompetent in actually using their air power to any real effect.

The USAF and USN are far and away the most powerful air forces in the world.  It isn't even a contest. No one else can do what they do on the scale they do it on.

&nbsp;

In one way you can sort of say this is what Desert Storm might have looked like if the coalition forces did not have the overwhelming air superiority that they did. Though that would also be discounting the coalition's superiority in land warfare equipment and training."

A bit from this

Ask thought-provoking questions while being warm and curious. Be prepared to listen deeply. You will know if you have listened well if you can repeat back to them what they said. Be humble and open to hearing what they say.

  
Keep conversations positive, productive, and civil. Never get angry. Stay resourceful. It is better to end the interaction than to say something counter-productive. It is better to return to the conversation at another time, rather than the person cutting off all communication out of anger or fear.

  
Adopt a general tone of curiosity and interest in their positions. Pretend you‚Äôre an impartial counselor. Really try to get inside their beliefs.

  
Try to connect them with their authentic identity before these extreme beliefs. Remind them of past experiences together. Talk about the connection you once had and how you miss it.  


Don‚Äôt ‚Äútell‚Äù them anything. Help them to make discoveries on their own.

  
Try to get them to look at reality from many different perspectives. This can include many things.

  
Teach them about indoctrination and mind control. Use examples for which they have no attachment.

  
Use examples of cult leaders with similar qualities to their group's leader(s) and have conversations about it.

  
Share feelings and perceptions, not judgments. Use ‚ÄúI feel‚Äù statements. Don‚Äôt claim to be ‚Äúright.‚Äù Stick to what your perception is when reflecting back to them.

  
Ask a question and then wait for them to think and respond. Be patient. You do not need to fill silence.

  
Caution: an abundance of facts won't necessarily help. Do not overwhelm them with information, especially if it attacks the leader or doctrine."

I think there's a hell of a lot of emotional learning and intelligence that comes from having that understanding.

CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"No, it doesn‚Äôt. And that kind of response is unhelpful and dishonest. Gathering that from my response is disingenuous and misleading. How can you not understand that reacting this way in these situations is like pouring fuel on the fire for the right wing nut jobs? I can take the disrespect, because I think know where you‚Äôre coming from, and I think your intentions are good, but you‚Äôre not being real, and people on both sides pick up on that. You should avoid that.

The goal is to be on the side of reason and truth. Neither the left nor the right own that. If you can‚Äôt admit that there are people on the left who are willfully stoking outrage with unreasonable points of view, you‚Äôre being dishonest about reality.

I‚Äôve already conceded that it was a cheap move for your sister to toss out the false equivalence fallacy. But don‚Äôt blind yourself to the faults of the left. The most extreme leftists may not be as harmful as the most extreme right wingers, but to pretend they don‚Äôt exist, and that they‚Äôre not having a negative impact on society, is dangerous.

If you can admit this while arguing with someone who is on the right, you‚Äôre able to reel them in enough to consider your point of view and potentially change their mind in a positive way. If you‚Äôre dishonest and unreasonable with them, it just antagonizes them and entrenches them further in their madness."

CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"I haven't been following these incidents so I will speak generally about what I know regarding hate crimes. 

It's not just as clear cut as the public outcry stating it's a hate crime. Each state has different laws surrounding what is considered a hate crime. Federally there are laws that were passed, but, ultimately it comes down to two things:
1. Is it a ""hate crime"" as determined by that states specific law?
2. If the state decides it isn't a hate crime, will the FBI choose to investigate/take over the case?

Using the two items above:
1. WI does not recognize gender identity as a basis for a hate crime. It only covers sexual orientation.
2. As far I can tell from very limited research, the FBI has not yet decided to do anything on these incidents. However, there may be something happening that the public isn't aware of, or that I wasn't able to find in a cursory search.

Here are three good resources for researching the basics:
[Southern Poverty Law Center Hate Crime Laws Explained ](https://www.splcenter.org/news/2022/09/07/hate-crime-laws-timeline)

The US has not fought on its own soil in sometime and modern firearms (not referring to automatic weapons because  those are heavily monitored in the us) can unload a lot of bullets very fast. Something that the founders of america did not live with.

 The use of firearms by criminals Is routine in America. It is very easy to obtain a firearm in some states, and very hard in others. There are two arguments. 1) restrict guns through intense background checks and waiting periods to ensure only the best Americans have them. Effective at keeping guns out of the hands of criminals. 2) make it generally east for any non felon with stable health to own a gun.  Effective at stopping someone with a gun, but puts more guns in the general population.

Taking the second amendment away would make 1/2 the country go bananas. It would be difficult if not impossible to collect all the guns in America. Does the 2nd amendment make sense? Idk probably not, but it's with America forever.

Every one wants to use stimulus in the form of tax cuts or more government spending in a recessionary environment, but no one wants to do the opposite when the economy needs to slow down due to inflationary pressures. They let the Fed do the dirty work because the Fed doesn‚Äôt have to run for reelection.

My wife later did come down positive again (post vax and booster) after the Omicron variant, but we did nothing for me at home keeping distance (other than standard precautions of not eating or drinking after, etc.), and I have never experienced a COVID positive test since end of 2019. I was in direct contact with multiple COVID positive hospitalized patients nearly every single day of the pandemic.

The best immunity is gained post recovery of the virus you want immunity from."
LIBERAL,r/conservative,"Incorrect judgment in a case, like when someone is charged and the DA loses the case in court, it's not the issue. The real issue is malicious prosecution by a DA and abuse of prosecutorial discretion AND not periodically reviewing their track record for abuse and bias.

There is no mechanism to have their decisions reviewed for how they arrived at the decision to charge in the first place and what led up to that.

I believe qualified immunity is necessary.  But I also think people are missing the point of the term. It should be ""qualified.""

In the case of the police, I used to think that qualified immunity should not be taken away because without it, it inhibits the way they go about their job. Without it, it can negatively influence how they do their job. 

But at the same time, qualified immunity needs proper and aggressive oversight because as we've seen many times in recent years, it can easily be abused and it's use can easily be rationalized. This is what has been coming to the surface and we've been finding out recently. There is a great lack of proper oversight that must accompany
qualified immunity for it to be effective.

So now I'm all for, in the name of balanced justice, figuring out in great detail exactly when qualified immunity should not exist or when it should be taken away in cases, even temporarily.  And maybe this is a case-by-case thing until a cop or a DA shows a track record of misuse and bad judgment?  Then I'm all for having it removed 100% for them permanently.

I'm NAL, so I don't have nearly the informational background needed to even begin to solve this problem.  There may also be other possible solutions that I'm completely unaware of like some kind of renewable insurance or bond or accreditation that needs to be put in place when police and DA's are given their authority?

But I also recognize that doing so after the fact could put a lot of cops and DAs in jeopardy for judgment they used. Removal of qualified immunity, even temporarily on individual cases, must be done with lots of advanced notice and training as well."

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"\>How did Dewine do? In pretty much every single election the Trump candidate underperformed normal republicans

Dewine did great but governors races are much less polarized than senate races, way more prone to blowouts. And again, who cares how much you win by if it's already a safe seat. DeWine was a disastrous governor on COVID, I much prefer a very conservative candidate like Vance to win by 6% in a Republican seat than a moderate win by a landslide in a seat that Republicans were always gonna win anyway. A win is a win, and 6% is more than a comfortable enough margin anyway, you don't gain much of anything by going past that. Vance was also running against a great Dem candidate in Tim Ryan, DeWine ran against nobody it wasn't a real campaign.

\>All of this happening in the best mid-term environment for the GOP since 1994. Those loses should have been lay-up victories. Not close loses.  
\>They are not lost for forever. However, we have 3 straight elections of them rejecting Trumpism, and when available accepting/embracing normal Republicans.  


I don't disagree, again I'm a DeSantis guy lmao. I'm just saying it's definitely very possible for Trump to win those states that he narrowly lost by, it's not an impossible task. In your original comment you said he basically had 0 chance in these states which I disagree with. I don't think he's the best option but I also don't think a 10,000-20,000 vote loss in some of these key states is impossible to flip.

\>Bush did pretty good. Trump has also cost the GOP the suburbs which will hurt long term in the growing areas of the country.  
Suburbs have been shifting democrat long before Trump, he definitely accelerated the trend but you can't pull Bush/Romney suburb margins when the suburns today are significantly less white and more college educated, two demographics that heavily favor dems. Look at the Atlanta or Virginia suburbs for example, Kemp/Youngkin's #s there despite being excellent candidates were still worse than the Bush days.

Also for Bush and the original question, despite winning 2 elections he never one one of those PA/WI/MI rust belt states which Republicans need in 2024 given how the map has shifted. He came very close in WI tbf, but again Trump is the first Republican since HW in 1988 to win any of those 3 states.  


\>If that is the case, then why did we win the house in 2022 but not 2020? Election after election since 2016 shows that Trump does more for Democrats than he does for the GOP.  
Again, I was talking about the Midwest in that comment, the white working class rural areas that are Trump's base. If you just look at the Midwest in 2018 and 2022, the House and Senate races are complete disasters because the rural voters simply didn't show up. And that'll be the question for DeSantis, can he turn out those low-propensity voters that Republicans need to win those states?"

CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"They got upset over Obama asking for a fancy mustard. Another time, he wore a tan suit. Once, he didn't salute a marine when he was boarding Air Force One (but they were fine with Trump saluting a North Korean soldier). Obama golfed too much.

They're offended by anyone getting basic rights and will claim that they're oppressed by this. They're upset by make-believe scenarios that will never happen. They're upset by the race of make-believe characters that they always pictured as white (because all heroes are white)."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"We‚Äôll find out on Tuesday. They have to be related to Daniels & Cohen. Cohen had a 7 count  superseding indictment - Rat . Costello was a good wit I‚Äôm hearing. It‚Äôs a huge indictment and Meg Reiss needs to recuse herself or I am filing a Bar complaint. The New York County grand jury & jury pool is scary. Kangaroo court. If Trump beats this , he will face someone I have firsthand experience with , Fulton County Judge Robert McBurney , who is anti gun , anti patriot , Liberal , foaming at the mouth for that indictment. Let‚Äôs see the defense. Trump can still run for President from jail and he‚Äôs crushing the numbers. #FreeTexMcIver #McWordy
Let‚Äôs keep in mind the DOJ said this case was weak and had no merits and refused to even bring it in front of a GJ!"
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,How?
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,Why isn‚Äôt there a widespread reddit campaign against this like there was when net neutrality was ended?
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,I‚Äôve done mystery shopping gigs at a mall with a build a bear.  The answer to that is so so so many well to do suburbanites.
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"It‚Äôs absolutely disgusting how the WH and media are spinning this tragedy. Trying to make it all about the LGBT community and how oppressed they are when in reality the ‚Äúattacks against them‚Äùare just people pushing back against the radical insanity. Floridas bill last year is an example of this. 

If anyone‚Äôs under attack it‚Äôs Christian‚Äôs and other communities that don‚Äôt subscribe to progressive or other left wing ideologies."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"They're in their ""death throws"", like the fossil fuel industry. Watch for the most desperate grasps ever- like worrying about drag queens. Watch for bullshit like injecting more religion at every turn to try to grasp for support. A lot of us are done with people who use religion to shore up their social standing."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"Oh, I meant our track record as a country, when you consider the past several decades of republican presidents."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,I think he will be a good choice down the road.
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"I don't understand the US ""democracy"". How is it that politicians can limit voting rights at all? They can make virtually anything criminal and then strip voting rights to those people."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"We need a law for this?? It should be a given, a no-brainer."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,This is why you don‚Äôt hire anyone with pronouns in their bios. Easy.
LIBERAL,r/liberal,Lol right! They do that a lot
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,I don't think Bush in 2007 intended for people to be forced to purchase and only be able to use products that barely existed at the time and weren't widely adopted. If he's that clairvoyant then we need to make him president again but I think we all know he isn't

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"And do you remember what the tankers did?

CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"It's pretty tame compared to what people say should be done with liberals...

This double standard is ridiculous."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"Exactly. A lot of people are in prison to provide free labor and profits for the prison industry. They have no business being there.

On the other hand you also have people who should never be allowed back out into the population. What do you do with them? A bit of a head-scratcher."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Come tf on you guys, you're always chirping that the left is ""soft"" but you're getting mad at teddy bears and claiming light bulbs give you seizures?

CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"As much as I wish this weren't the case, it's true. I mean, Donald Trump wasn't a Christian before his presidential run and he's not a Christian now, but he was willing to lie about it, and the base ate that up. I would love a secular president, but we still live in a country where 40% of the population believes in Noah's Ark and that the Earth is only 6,000 years old, so I don't see a path to the white house for anyone that's openly atheist."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"Well, it‚Äôs a good thing he wasn‚Äôt a drag queen then he would‚Äôve been really dangerous 


Yes, I‚Äôm being sarcastic"
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"It is odd to me that they never mention parents in this. How about people quit letting the internet raise their kids, and pay attention to them? So many single parent homes these days, and parents that don't even realize their kids exist until they see them on the news. I'm not saying that was what happened in Nashville, but I do believe it has a lot to do with others."

CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"The most shocking aspect of this imo is educated people taking part in the problem. How can attorneys, judges and doctors be for such things? The toxicity of the movement involves brainwashing to the educated and or giving themselves permission to express their hatred."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Nazi Germany was a dictatorship. Do you want a system in which one person decides for everyone, or in which the majority rules? I am not saying it is a perfect system, far from it. But it's better than a dictatorship.

CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,Paywalled.
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"Of course we can't trust them to be decent. We can trust them to act cruelly and ignorantly.

They supported the nomination of liars to the Supreme Court and celebrated when women's right to abortion was taken away.  
The threatened violence upon election workers, government officials and school board members.  
Nah.  We know what they are and what they will do given the chance. If we trust them again, shame on us."

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,Hopefully you are talking about leftists. The bizarre indoctrination going on in schools is outrageous and unbelievable to me. The fact that some of these so-called teachers are allowed near young children is astonishing.
LIBERAL,r/liberal,See your first problem right here is assuming rights are 'given' to you by the government.  That may be how it is in your country.  In this country rights are recognized and the entire purpose of the Bill of Rights is to establish that the government can't infringe on those existing rights.

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Am neurodivergent.

Sometimes I don't act quite like normal people.  I'm not very friendly, I don't get jokes, I have a hard time with too much noise and disorganization.  But I think it's perfectly reasonable for an employer to expect me to show up on time, not cancel for no reason, and generally get my stuff done with a minimum of drama.  That's why they're paying me, after all.

Neurodivergence isn't my fault, but other people shouldn't be expected to manage it for me.  Some understanding, yes, but ultimately it's my responsibility."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,Congress can't make laws that specifically target individuals/businesses.

CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"It used to be that Catholics were indeed a pariah politically. The assumption, largely more anti-immigrant than anything, was that Catholics were more aligned with Rome than ‚ÄòMurica. 

When Catholics were considered more ‚Äúethnic,‚Äù they were more likely to vote Democratic. The Roe decision and the hard right shift of the U.S. Conference of Bishops changed that.  

Historically, if you want an anti-Catholicism in politics, check out Al Smith‚Äôs Presidential campaign in 1928 and what the Hooverites flung at him."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,Given the choice between Joe Biden and Desantis I would certainly vote for the latter.

What are other things that need done, in your opinion?"
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"Well, but it seems to me that the law applies to speech and debate *inside the halls of Congress.* It also appears to protect them from arrest on their way to our from those places and while inside. 

It isn't clear to me what is specifically meant by ""questioned,"" because certainly Congresspeople have been questioned in every forum about stuff they say in session. 

However, going by this it does appear you can sue them for slander over something said in public. Twitter posts somehow being ""official channels"" now, I'm not sure if that is protected or not. But if they go on the dumbass faux news shows and say shit that provably qualifies as slander, I say go for it. The conservatives have gone waaay waaay beyond batshit crazytown with their accusations now, it's like they'll say anything at all."

LIBERAL,r/liberal,"This is the perfect genius plan by the gop, think about as long as he is in office the rest of us will be bitching and moaning for the gop to do something.

It's all a distraction technique."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"The Republican party in its current form is an entrenched cult. The only rational voters in their camp are the rich and powerful trying to become richer and more powerful.

The results of that debt weren't really felt until Bush's presidency."

LIBERAL,r/conservative,"Advocating for restrictions on what people can eat can be viewed as authoritarian because it involves using the power of the government to control individuals' personal choices and behaviors. In a free society, individuals should have the right to make their own decisions about what they eat, without fear of punishment or coercion.

It's important to consider the practical implications of such restrictions. Enforcing laws or regulations on what people can eat would require significant government resources and could infringe upon personal privacy and autonomy. It would also raise questions about who gets to decide what is and isn't allowed, as well as the potential for abuse of power."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Recently yes that has been the case. 

See: abortion bans, trying to restrict voting on college campuses, fighting 'woke' (whatever the hell that means, generally sounds like trying to dictate thought/culture which doesn't seem very pro individual liberty), vilification of LGBT community.

LIBERAL,r/liberal,">As for limiting the number of businesses a person can own, I'm not sure what the point of that its?

I start two businesses.  You hire one of my businesses to perform some work for you. The way I conduct business causes serious harm to you.  You can only sue that particular business, rather than me.  You can only go after the assets I've put in that business's name, rather than all the business assets I have. If that particular business doesn't have the assets necessary to make you whole, to bad, so sad. I just cut off that particular branch and focus on my other businesses. 

Being limited to one business doesn't stop me from exploring multiple business ventures.  It just means that they are treated as different divisions of the same parent company. When one of my divisions causes you harm, you can seek restitution from the parent company and all of its divisions. 

You should not be able to attack my home or personal property, but you should not be limited to just one of my business ventures to make yourself whole. You should be able to recoup damages from any and all of my business activities."

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,Good luck with that!
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Yes, it‚Äôs clearly deliberate.  The next question is why?

You have to look at their goals.  You know what they want.  How does this feed it?

My view is this is about creating a crisis.  People who are being preyed on constantly and don‚Äôt feel safe will want the government to do something.  Take away some more freedom for protection.  Another chunk of 2A gone. 

But fighting back yourself undermines this.  So they want to discourage people from doing it by prosecuting them.  Even if they don‚Äôt get a conviction, the point is to ruin them one way or another as a warning to anyone else thinking of doing likewise.

Other theories that fit their goals and the facts might be valid.  Occam‚Äôs Razor applies.

The bigger question is why do they need to get rid of the 2A.  The CCP Virus lockdowns in other disarmed Western countries should have given you some idea. 

Beyond that, at some point not too long from now, maybe 1-2 decades, the entitlement and welfare system will collapse in bankruptcy.  Take a look at history for what happens next to the ruling class.  Our rulers already know the answer to that question."

LIBERAL,r/liberal,"There should be more than ""adequate"" background checking. There should be mental health requirements. There should be longer waiting periods.

The reality is that mental health care is a super low priority in this country. It's just not that fact alone, though. Healthcare in this country is expensive for most. More and more people continue to struggle in this country because of the rising cost of living and the stagnant base pay range. People simply can't afford to live RIGHT.

Living right is living in a place with a livable wage for the WORKING CLASS. A place that provides healthcare instead of giving that money to domestic spying and proxy wars in foreign countries that line the pockets of the elite. A place that PRIORITIZES EDUCATION and uses our tax money as such.  


I could go on, but my point is that the cause of this problem is a hairy beast that we haven't even begun to tackle those issues that we are facing that contribute not just to school shootings, but the lack of care for our working class in general. We are seeing the outcome of a struggling uneducated population being fed disinformation.

There may be reasonable accommodations an employer can provide, but it will ultimately be on the employee if they remain employable.  It sounds like you compensate for your disorganization well."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"This is the only reason I'm disappointed about this happening. If they do this it has a chance to backfire, it's hella likely not to pass, and then trump can run on ""they tried to stop me from running!!!"" And could win the nomination.

The coopting and misuse of the term ""woke"" by the far right and their fight against it is just a rebranding and expansion from the old ""War on Christmas"" we had to endure every December from Fox news, starting decades ago.

Trying to roll back society to a ""simpler time"" is as fake as the politicians and muckrakers that push it. The people they call to their cause would be just as broke, just as powerless, and just as miserable in 1950 as they are today.

LIBERAL,r/conservative,"This has more to do with arrested development in adults than with kids.

Adults buy a lot more toys *for themselves* than they ever used to.  It's their adolescent brain making use of their adult financial resources.

CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"They very likely come from legislators, in some cases decades ago. I'm not saying this applies in this specific incidence - I'm speaking to the broader issue of people always seeking to find blame in others even if the target is clearly not the appropriate target. It's a sociological phenomenon that takes on a variety of forms depending on context. How much of that is manifesting here remains to be seen.

(Edit: Specifically to schools; they are *all* taking school shootings seriously. Teachers put their lives in danger - in a way that ought be unimaginable - simply walking into school just like the kids do. They have every reason to be *even more terrified* than most adults. 

These shootings are now a weekly experience for schools, hitting all types of educational institutions regardless of geographic location, local politics, income inequality, wealthy v poverty, etc.

Don't get me started on the everyday homo- & trans- phobia & as the mother of a trans person I live in terror for her every time she leaves the house. 
What I'm trying to say is: there may have been a time when you were right, that republicans were just people with different opinions. I don't think that's true anymore. I think they have become truly dangerous people with no care for anyone but themselves & their own values."

CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"I'm a Democrat. I recognize that Xi wants a militarily strong China and to take Taiwan (solving what the Chinese call the ""Taiwan Problem""), but I wish there were some way we could have good relations with China (as long as they don't invade Taiwan). Part of Republican opposition to China is just regular conservative Republican racism and religious anti-atheism (because China, with only 1% of people attending regular religious services, is an atheist country). Also there is blue-collar hatred of China for taking our low-skill factory jobs, although now cost of living in China is going up and some of those jobs are moving to poorer countries. I dunno. Russia allied itself with the Republican Party (even though they deny it, I have reasons to believe the contrary). Maybe China can ally itself with the US Democratic Party? I dunno. Maybe Xi could go on a tourist trip through the US taking photos or Biden could do the same in China? I don't want to go to war with China."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,Biden got 81 million votes at a time when many states legalized ballot harvesting and mass mail out ballots. Republicans need to understand the amount of people who intend to vote on Election Day and the amount of people who actually show up is two totally different things. Democrats are able to capitalize on getting people who don‚Äôt even know when Election Day is and just walked by ‚ÄúRepublican is a Nazi‚Äù poster to immediately turn in a ballot days and weeks before an election. The big red wave did hit in the midterms but it only hit in Florida where republicans showed up early in big numbers to vote. Unless people get this it doesn‚Äôt matter who the nominee is in 2024. The democrats hope it‚Äôs Trump because they can get a lot more miles out of their pumped up anger and fundraising.

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Democrats don't understand how hard it is to run a successful business. They think if you're a business owner, that you're loaded, and money just grows on trees for you. They seem to treat hiring employees as some sort of charity act where you can give everyone a million dollar salary with all kinds of benefits for working 3 hours per week. They don't seem to understand that you're hiring someone to do a job, so that they can try and make money for your own family. They don't understand how hard it is to find good employees to make your business run, and that making good hiring decisions can be the defining factor in whether or not you're able to keep your doors open and avoid bankruptcy.

So sure, they think that you can hire an employee who is always late, cancels last minute, has emotional outbursts to customers and in front of customers, and none of that is going to affect your bottom line. They don't understand the realities of running a business."

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"For sure, yeah. 

The big question is: who gets to decide what constitutes ""graphic content""? Do we leave it up to individual professors to exercise common sense? Or does it need to be regulated at a higher level of management within the university?

Obviously war footage and discussion of rape are sensitive topics, and deserve Consideration. That much should be obvious. But who knows who might get triggered by what. For example... .. Oh, I dunno... People having a ham sandwich? (eating meat). Some people get triggered by that. Do we provide trigger warnings for that? I posit that's absurd. But who am I to say? I'm just some jackass on reddit.

People would have you believe that the choice is binary: either let profs exercise common sense, or we delegate the decision to management. Frankly, I'm more middle-of-the-road: I suggest having the university publish a blanket guidance (a policy that's unenforceabable) *suggesting* that as a best-practicd certain content be prefaced with a content warning. List the sorts of content that some people might be troubled by, the reason why it's best practice to provide a content warning, and publish it in an annual issue of guidance to all university teaching staff - then let them decide in their own classrooms how to conduct things. If someone gets butt hurt, it then becomes an issue between the student and the professor."

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"This is the reasonable way to look at it. I'm as supportive of fair trans rights as possible, and the way you have it laid out seems to be the best balance of compromise possible for now. Pre-hrt, I definitely had a physical advantage over the average woman. Yet after not even all too long on it, that advantage was more than gone as my Testosterone levels dropped slightly below healthy cisfem range. I'm 5'7"", 110lbs, and hauling around a ton of extra volume as body fat instead of muscle now, so there is absolutely no discernible advantage remaining. I'm probably even at a slight disadvantage to a similarly built cis woman because I haven't had nearly a full lifetime to get used to a drastically different body, and it's going to take a lot of reacclimation to be able push it to the same levels I did when playing various sports when younger. 

People try to cheat in sports frequently enough that it always has to be a concern, as fairness is essential to proper competition. Nobody's going to essentially chemically castrate themselves with hrt just to get into the women's league, but they sure as hell can just lie about their identity like this guy did to prove a point. Just can't start forming regulations around such necessities while also subsequently making it needlessly difficult to get on hrt for those who know what they're signing up for. Transgender sports leagues just aren't feasible either as there are very very few trans people (some people outright thinking it's like 20% of people when it's barely 1%) and outside of maybe some dense population centers, there wouldn't be the minimum population necessary to maintain enough membership.

We already know those two groups along with transage are making a push to become accepted along with the map community.

Maybe you don't feel that kids that age are capable of understanding what being trans means, if so, what age do you think a person has to be before they can be diagnosed with gender dysphoria?

Personally, with only 0.05% of the population identifying as trans, I feel that is it more that people are just comfortable committing they are trans. Much in the same way when Americans stopped oppressing left handed people that the amount of left handed people exponentially increased, not because of a trend, but because they were always left handed and they didn't have to hide it anymore."

No, you create the laws to go after the biggest problems, and you create carve-outs to address specific small instances when certain small groups need to be protected.

Wealthy people fucking people over is a drastically bigger and drastically more pressing issue than the hypothetical of an individual small business having a problem.

In the face of emerging world peace and in desperate need of an ‚Äúother‚Äù to be the villain, they chose the Democratic Party, half of America, and spun a lie so ridiculous we didn‚Äôt take them seriously.

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"I used to judge both of them based on their policies. What I realize now that is that more than a strategic policy maker, we need a conservative warrior. This is obvious from the Trump indictment. Trump is the original warrior and he gives zero fucks for the establishment. For example, he started his election campaign at Waco. lol. He is the ideological leader of the conservatives and I prefer him over anyone else."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,Has anyone confirmed the speaker‚Äôs sex?  This may need to be a door to door operation.
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Good times don't make weak men, bad times do not make strong men. Otherwise the various hellish conditions in deeply corrupt countries would be making, well, considerably stronger men than they are right now. And wealthier countries would be far weaker than they are.

Discipline makes strong men, and it's perfectly compatible with good times. Lack of resources and lack of discipline create weak men. It's just that often good times don't demand as much discipline, and people can end up letting it slide either for themselves or for their children. It needs to be artificially produced when external challenges are absent, which is part of what proper education systems include. 

This is also a problem when it comes to wealth, status, power which often overlap with good times. When it's too easy to win you don't learn as much from a lack of opposition."

LIBERAL,r/liberal,"I think people need to understand that both sides lie and say whatever to get elected. I‚Äôd also wager that present day Washington is a facade and outside influences pull the strings which is why Trump was attacked harder than any other President in history. He‚Äôs not a purchased insider. The liberal left LOVED him and he‚Äôll Oprah even interviewed the guy asking years ago if he‚Äôd ever run in which he at the time didn‚Äôt want to. Once he announced then the attacks began. He was a threat to the agenda in place. 4 years kill lots of momentum so 8 years would have derailed a ton of items like Great Reset, social credit or carbon credit scores being floated now."
LIBERAL,r/conservative,"To be as successful as Trump has been in business and politics, you are going to make a lot of enemies along the way who are afraid, jealous, or both, and want to bring you down.

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"I honestly don't think that the Dems are trying to destroy Trump. I think it even goes farther than that.

They brought this frivilous charge against Trump, specifically to rally his base around him. They WANT Rupublicans to rise up in disgust and 'rally the troops' to vote for Trump. They WANT Trump to win over these charges and win the Republican Primary. AND IT'S WORKING! Look at Trump's increased campaign revenue since the indictment.

They believe that if Trump wins the Republican primary, they have a shot at winning the next presidential race in 2024. They are very afraid if DeSantis or even if Pompeo wins the Republican ticket, for either of them will mop the floor with Biden.

If the Republicans win the presidency, we will control the White House, the House of Representatives, and the Senate! (Harris is not the tie-breaker).

This is all a trap......"

However, I blow most people out of the water if I am responsible for 1 major task (it helps if I find that task interesting). So I went to work in an industry that I find interesting, and that greatly rewards people with long attention spans for doing 1 thing. In the event that I need to multi-task, I know I need to make a list or I will just go in circles getting 5% of each thing done. With the list to tell me what to do, I can crank it out. I also set alarms like you. Take responsibility for yourself and be a good team mate and your boss/team won't give a shit the times that you fail.

LIBERAL,r/conservative,"Trump ran and won by force of will, when he wanted to. Your model isn't valid. It is more like an excuse for milquetoast candidates when they lose, which allows them to evade confronting the truth of the matter.

If DeSantis is viable, then he can create his own momentum in 2028. That might actually prove that he is more than beltway anti-Trump hype. And that he actually has the political backbone and creativity to lead, rather than merely riding Trump's coat-tails.

DeSantis is about to be severely starved of attention, due to the indictment. For better or worse, he doesn't have a chance in 2024. I'd advise him to avoid your terrible advice and to wait until 2028.

But unlike DeSantis supporters in regard to Trump, it doesn't matter at all to Trump supporters if DeSantis runs. It's his career. He can scuff it up as he likes.

What I see is that Never Trumpers hate Trump so badly that they want to force DeSantis to run, regardless of his chances and without regard for the man's career."

Well that's just blatantly false. No serious person actually believes that.

He does not have what it takes to capture America's votes.

He might do OK in Florida? But elsewhere? I don't think he has what it takes. Especially in his beliefs, philosophy and how he governs the state of Florida.

Also? Who wants Trump 2.0?"
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"There's a procedure to follow when declassifying documents which tRump did not follow. His declaring in his feeble brain that a document is declassified does not make it so.

CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"So, lets see... how to further attempt to make villains out of libraries that allow for ""drag readings"" for kids...

1) Make the assumption that the two things are somehow equal. This is outright false, as the whole point of allowing someone in different gendered or sexed dress read to kids is meant to show inclusion and break down assumptions about other people. Mr. Cameron's ideology is the exact opposite of this.

2) Make Mr. Cameron into some kind of victim being turned down...*because he's Christian?* No, because he's attempting to be an activist Christian. He is well known for his non-inclusive and frankly hateful beliefs. 

3) Assume the damn book warrants a reading to kids at a library. I don't know for sure, but I don't think the Drag Queens are reading from their own books. Is there any merit to Mr. Cameron's book? Is it good? Is his message and is the intent of this entire stunt worth the time and resources of a **publicly funded institution?**"

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Context: I'm a neuropsychologist (focus on brain injuries, strokes, general cognitive functioning)

I'm with you, and of course there's more latitude to be given when it's more severe. 

The reality is autism traits fall on a spectrum, at it's core is social cognition. Some people are very socially adept and might be called social butterflies, charismatic, etc. On the other end we have very severe autism where the person can grasp that others have their own mind and will. We all fall somewhere in between. Where the demarcation point is for a _disorder_ comes down to functional impairment. There's more to it but that's a core truth and it's the same for things like intelligent deficits, ADHD, etc. 

The issue is there's a trend to get diagnosed from Dr. Social media. There are people who overly embrace the neurodivergent term when they aren't, or it's very mild.  They identify some traits that by definition _we all have some times_ (even a social butterfly occasionally fails to read the room, or make a poorly timed comment) and call it a disorder then demand acceptance and equity in results. 

They aren't many. And I've seen more online it seems, but I have worked with some people that fall into category and it can be very grating telling them they don't have a disorder, that they're cognitively healthy."

It‚Äôs literally been in the platforms for several major Presidential Candidates, Rick Perry is the one who springs to mind most readily. Betsy Devos, Trump‚Äôs Secretary  of Education was basically there to dismantle it from within.

LIBERAL,r/conservative,"That‚Äôs one of the biggest problems with this world rate now and what I believe is a major reason why so many kids are depressed, anxious etc 

And why some go down a path of isolation and radicalization.

People are taught from a young age that the world is all loving treat others how you wanna be treated, always treat people with respect.

Children think that respect is something that is passively given which it is in terms of basic passive human respect.

Like respecting someone‚Äôs space, right to privacy all that stuff just being a decent human.

Then there‚Äôs actual respect such as people wanting to be around you, people wanting to learn more about your ideals and so on.

There‚Äôs a difference between respect we‚Äôd all give one another as curtesy for being part of the same species, then there‚Äôs respecting somebody as a person by the conduct of there character.

We gotta stop teaching kids that everybody in this world is gonna care about them and respect them because it almost guarantees disappointment.

You have a whole generation of kids who think there always gonna have all the good stuff in life from people then they leave high school/ college lose most of there friends and become depressed.

Aside from kids knowing there family will always love an respect them, they should be taught everybody else in society doesn‚Äôt have to like or respect them.

Only through hard work and proving you‚Äôre a good reliable person will you then get the respect from society you want. 

Gotta teach them to build themselves up from what they are so they have a goal on who they wanna be

If you‚Äôre goal driven and focused on improving yourself the respect you crave comes from within and not from other people most of the time"

3. Nazis

5. Terrorists

Disgusting double standards.
There is a war on kids happening. Don‚Äôt forget about the subject of all these outrageous antics. No child should ever be allowed to turn themselves into a carnival side show. No ‚Äúparent‚Äù should ever be allowed to persuade their ‚Äúchild‚Äù to become their science project. If we don‚Äôt protect these children from their mentally sick parental guardians, no one will. It should be a criminal offense and treated just the same as child abuse because IT IS CHILD ABUSE. 
Lastly any reference to ANYONE being ‚Äúunder attack‚Äù should be directed towards CHRISTIANS. Was it not 3 innocent Christian kids that were slaughtered a few days ago? Any sympathy given towards this deranged shooter or their affiliations should be treated as a potential on going threat against the Christian community. Don‚Äôt listen to statistics, they are easily manipulated. The blame is being pointed at everything except the actual problem. MENTAL HEALTH. Don‚Äôt believe the lies, they are meant to indoctrinate others. The 1% alphabet circus has a disease. Victimization is the largest symptom of this epidemic."

They had multiple reports that day alone, including a couple that he had a gun with / on him, and just ignored it, NBD (his *pockets* are *too small*), hoping he'd just go home with it and become someone else's problem. Plus you have a kid who is apparently so far off the rails, the requirement was that he needs a parent to accompany him in school, and then that's somehow the week they don't, so why is he even in the classroom?

That's definitely not on the teachers, it's not like they're given a choice about who's in their classroom. It's unclear how much blame rests on the principal, but that's what the investigation is for, they can still fire plenty more people if it's warranted, but they can safely start at the top for now."

They specifically wanted signals intel, particularly what is being send from our nuclear bases up to satellites - I'm sure most people know that China is fast developing anti-satellite weapons so they can take out US comms, GPS etc. if war breaks out.

Another satellite can't do that. 

 Flying a plane over US nuclear bases would get them shot down pretty quick, and also means they are only near a base for a few seconds.

A balloon is unlikely to be shot down (well, until recently anyway), moves slowly and at a good altitude for sig intel of this type, has better deniability etc."

LIBERAL,r/liberal,"Yeah I don't really support the police but I can't exactly express that to a cop. That would be idiotic and it would be asking for trouble. Whenever I'm friendly to them they usually let me go. But maybe it's because I'm white. Like for instance one time I got pulled over for having a headlight out and I was completely drunk. (This was like 20 years ago). And the cop just let me go because I was friendly with him. And one time I swerved because I was texting and the cop just let me go because I was friendly. One time a cop caught me with weed and he just let me go because I was friendly with him.

But I'm white and these were all white cops. So maybe that has something to do with it.

But yeah if you're ever going to get in a fight with somebody you should expect to win. Otherwise why the hell are you asking to lose a fight? So I don't really understand why people are always trying to fight the cops. If you're going to fight the cops you have to be certain that you can kick his ass."

Also, if you start a hairdressing business and a restaurant and I sue you for giving me a bad haircut, how does it make sense that I can take assets from the restaurant?

>Are you arguing that instead of educating American children on the achievements of Ghandi, we should instead condemn the man because of some dudes you met once?

>This attitude would mean we should have no statues or memorials or anything to anyone. Should we destroy our war memorials in DC because some of those soldiers whose names appear there were bad? 

That's a broad generalisation, almost every man bar none previous to the last few generations were raging sexists and I'm not suggesting we tare down every statue of every man that died pre 1900s.

I don‚Äôt use the word respect to mean fear, which would be a more appropriate word for your snake example.

I also don‚Äôt use respect to mean admire, which would be more appropriate for your leadership example.

When I say that human beings are deserving of basic respect and dignity, I am saying that I recognize and believe that all human beings are of equal innate value. The key operative word there is innate.

Sure, not everyone on the soccer team is equally skilled or contributes equally to the win or loss, but on a fundamental level, that doesn‚Äôt matter. Fundamentally, human beings are not to be valued for their instrumental utility, but for essentially being human.

No, this doesn‚Äôt mean everyone gets a trophy. In practical day to day worldly matters, we evaluate people based on outcomes, effort, growth, etc. All of those factors contribute to the added level of respect or dignity we place *on top* of the basic levels with which we already ought to treat everyone.

And no, I do not mean mere politeness, which is superficial, often insincere, and sometimes condescending.

I respect other people in part because they all have lives as rich and complex as my own, and I humbly accept that I do not have the capacity to fully and completely understand anyone. Yet, by striving to deepen my understanding, and accepting that life is about discovering truth, not mandating it, my appreciation and respect for people regardless of their station in life or particular attributes grows."

Lauren H. received a devastating fetal diagnosis two weeks after Roe was overturned, and in the chaos that followed, she was forced to travel to Seattle for an abortion. 

Pregnant again now, Lauren H. fears that Texas is not safe for her or her family. 

Anna was forced to fly across multiple states after her water broke, risking that she would go into labor or septic shock on the journey.

I have literally wept with fear and grief while trying to explain to people who say they love me that this kind of law could very, very easily cause my death and I don't think anything I said sunk in. It would take my actual death, and even then they would probably just go ""oh what a tragedy"" and not think about how easily preventable my death was. 

I don't know. I'm not trying to be a downer. There are WAY more men who support reproductive rights now than there were ten years ago! But I think for a certain subset of the population, it's going to have to be something that deeply, horrifically affects their own life for them to pay attention."

Declaring that people who have concerns over gender affirming care for kids (such as the effects of puberty blockers on kids, look up the case of Jazz Jennings, who is experiencing depression after transitioning for years because they did the surgeries way too soon) as hateful is not only hateful for you or others to do but it also makes people immediately discredit your arguments. 

Concern over the education and safety of kids should be more highlighted. Kids shouldn‚Äôt be coerced by radical activists masquerading as teachers to accept their ideologies. These ‚Äúteachers‚Äù need to stop pushing ideologies and either actually do their jobs or quit being a teacher. 

Plus the articles you linked are clearly biased with certain political leanings. Sources like Vox are not a reputable and it only discredits your argument. 

And fyi, the President didn‚Äôt declare a crusade. That is an outright lie being spread by sites like what you linked.

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"The judge cannot tell Trump he can't talk.  The gag order has to be very specific to the case, which in this case is anything to do with Stormy Daniels.

If bullets weren't invented until 1847, what were they shooting previously, spit wads? The founders were educated men who knew of the transformation of guns. For example, the Ferguson rifle. It was designed in 1770 and used by the British in 1777. This is a breech loading rifle that could fire 4 times per minute as opposed to the Brown Bess musket. They knew products would evolve in the future they just didn't know how. So, your argument is flawed."

LIBERAL,r/liberal,"it's more like picking the right battles if we looks at the start of liberalism they were focused on gaining voting rights and removing monarchys. then it was about ending slavery, gaining equal rights for minorities and women which was a long ass battle that can be argued is still happening just not on such a broad bases, then we moved on to smaller groups gay people, Jewish people ect. the current movement for Trans rights is just an extention of that. 
liberals in the past did the best they could with the knowledge they had and the society they lived in, they fought specific battles to get large groups of people rights they didn't have only in recent time can we focus on what is comparatively smaller groups of humans
the past is the past but we are here in the future"
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"Excellent question. His opponent‚Äôs campaign people are clearly utterly incompetent. Guaranteed that several people‚Äòs sole job was to dig up dirt on Santos. Easiest job in the world it turns out.

On the other hand, Santos is more than a mere liar. Dude seriously sounds like a sociopath. No way that didn‚Äôt manifest itself during his campaign, which puts into question his entire staff as well.

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Love how desperate some outlets are to push Trump.

Yes, this is the rally round the Trump effect that happens every time he gets wrongly attacked.

No it doesn't mean the primaries are a given because (1) they're months out and (2) Trump has yet to prove disciplined enough to not make this solely about him which is where he loses significant ground."
LIBERAL,r/conservative,"Sorry but that's still not how it works. They could steal information if you are using tik tok's browser to go to other sites within their app. They never had the ability to simply steal info from other apps by being installed on a phone. By design, iOS and Android doesn't allow this."
LIBERAL,r/conservative,"Yeah, I agree that it will take time, but homelessness isn't a NEW problem. So in my mind, these laws are at best trying to subvert the issue and history tells me this is where the buck stops. Because they almost never result in dramatic efforts to correct the overall issue and make meaningful change. 

Maybe I'm just cynical."
LIBERAL,r/conservative,But Orange Man bad!!!  He hurts my feels!!!
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"I think most people feel the same way.  I think people transitioning and becoming the gender they want to be is fantastic, but in competitive sports at any level, people born male will have an advantage over people born female.  Unless the transition began before puberty, which is obviously a whole other controversial topic.

My favorite sport is disc golf.  There was a pretty recent controversy involving this.  It ended up leading to the sport's governing body, the PDGA, making a rule that male to female transgender players cannot compete in the Female professional division in the sport's ""biggest"" tournaments unless they began to transition before puberty.

They can still compete in the Female division in lower tier tournaments if transitioning after puberty, but they have to prove that their testosterone levels are below a certain threshold, and that they have been taking the gender affirming hormone therapy for at least 24 months prior to playing.

To me, this is completely fair.  It allows MtF transgender athletes to compete as females in A-tier events and below.  A-tiers are not ""major"" tournaments, but you need to be an extremely talented disc golfer to be competitive in one at the open/pro level.  Winning an A-tier tournament is still a prestigious thing.  Also, a man can't just say ""I'm transitioning,"" begin HRT, and start competing as a female right away.

For reference, the vast majority of men that are competitive disc golfers would not be able to win an A-tier event competing only against women, or even get close."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,The whole stack should be fired.
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Hey, I actually read the *National Enquirer*. Sometimes I wonder if it's just for fun."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"He also needs some public speaking lessons geared toward politics. Right now it feels like he's always preaching to a captive audience in a board room, not the public.

CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"JK Rowling is not being persecuted in any meaningful way.

She has not had her Twitter account taken away from her. She‚Äôs still writing books and selling millions. She is currently making millions off of the licensing of a brand new and beloved videogame. 

She has been VERY vocal, in quite a confrontational way, on her position on Trans folks in a way that most of her childhood fans take issue with, mainly out of concern that she is motivating trans hate crimes or oppressive legislation.

Some of them boycott her products at an individual level, and that‚Äôs their right. Some send her mean messages on Twitter. None of them have demanded she be jailed for her beliefs or prevented from writing novels. We vote with our wallets. 

You can call that ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù if you‚Äôd like, but Rowling wipes her tears every evening with hundred dollar bills. She isn‚Äôt suffering. She‚Äôs only ever doubled down on her beliefs, and everyone who disagrees with her loud, publicly-stated beliefs is allowed to loudly criticize her.

Louis CK got ‚Äúcancelled‚Äù for masturbating in front of female comedians. He‚Äôs still selling out shows and distributing specials independently.

John Cleese recently ranted about how the BBC cancels people and he was probably next because of his offensive humor. These remarks were made on a BBC interview program and he continues to have a television show on their network.

Dave Chapelle got ‚Äúcancelled‚Äù because of his jokes about trans people. Still selling out shows and making millions. Netflix has not removed his content.

‚ÄúCancel culture‚Äù is a political buzzword and nothing else. It is nothing more than consumers reacting to content creators and public figures in a manner they deem fit considering that public figure‚Äôs conduct.

And though some conservatives might like to claim that they engage in no such ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù behavior, they‚Äôre raging hypocrites in reality. The amount of wailing and gnashing of teeth over Rihanna wearing a revealing outfit while pregnant during the superbowl? Boycotting tv shows for featuring gay characters? Actively passing legislation to make cross dressing in front of children punishable by law? 

Crocodile tears. They can go fuck themselves."

Well.  The Times They Are A-Changin' (paraphrased from the great poet and Nobel Laureate - and one of my favorite humans - Bob Dylan).  

Thank goodness!

The Times They Are A-Changin [here](https://youtu.be/90WD_ats6eE).

Come gather 'round people

Wherever you roam

And admit that the waters

Around you have grown

And accept it that soon

You'll be drenched to the bone

If your time to you is worth savin'

And you better start swimmin'

Or you'll sink like a stone

For the times they are a-changin'

Come writers and critics

Who prophesize with your pen

And keep your eyes wide

The chance won't come again

And don't speak too soon

For the wheel's still in spin

And there's no tellin' who

That it's namin'

For the loser now

Will be later to win

For the times they are a-changin'


Come senators, congressmen

Please heed the call

Don't stand in the doorway

Don't block up the hall

For he that gets hurt

Will be he who has stalled

The battle outside ragin'

Will soon shake your windows

And rattle your walls

For the times they are a-changin'

Come mothers and fathers

Throughout the land

And don't criticize

What you can't understand

Your sons and your daughters

Are beyond your command

Your old road is rapidly agin'

Please get out of the new one

If you can't lend your hand

For the times they are a-changin'


The line it is drawn

The curse it is cast

The slow one now

Will later be fast

As the present now

Will later be past

The order is rapidly fadin'

And the first one now

Will later be last

For the times they are a-changin'

CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"When I feel like that, I think back on Watergate. If I'm remembering right, it took longer than two years to get Nixon to just resign, and he didn't do anything as bad as Donald and they didn't have to do a full investigation and trial.

News of the Watergate break-in broke, hearings were begun, one by one more people testified, inch by inch they got closer and closer. But it still took over two years for the investigation and hearings to finally turn up enough evidence to convince enough Republican senators to vote for convicting him, so those Republicans then went to him and told him he needed to resign because they weren't behind him any more.

If he didn't, it probably would have been another full year for a completed investigation, ducks in a row, and impeachment trial. It fucking sucks HARD that justice goes so damn slow, but there we go.  It's why I still think voting is so important - get the bastards out before they can do more damage, then let justice catch up."

Personally, I think California Governor Gavin Newsome would be a better match against DeSantis. He's not afraid to go toe-to-toe with DeSantis and won't have any problem making DeSantis look like a fool!"
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,Yes and by now most psychiatrists believe it‚Äôs the cult like behavior of his supporters who are so confused about their role as Americans they still support the toxic qunt even *after* his Jan 6 coup attempt. You sound like you could be one of these affected/infected people.
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,Actually the number one cause of death for people under the age of 18 in United States is car accidents. According to most statistical articles. Firearms and drug overdoses. Are a close second and third.  The definition of an assault rifle is nothing other than a rifle that someone commits assault with. It's not actually a type of weapon. You can take your great great grandfather's musket rifle and shoot somebody with it and it now is by definition a Assault rifle. Not trying to argue but this is why this problem isn't making progress.
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Well it was a woman, so that‚Äôs a non issue."

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,">These are questions for ask a liberal.

Exactly.

Look at lefties like Rage Against the Machine, Howard Stern or any number of Hollywood types that have been outspoken in their leftist ideology.

Why are they all big-government suck-ups now? They were anti-establishment before."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,MSNBC was walking it this afternoon.  It‚Äôs why I posted it to gage reaction.

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"That was one of USA Today's first statements about the thing, was addressing that the sheriff used the wrong terminology when describjng the shooter."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,Opposing the Party line is always a bad move when dealing with a political mouthpiece network.
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Interpreting a hush money payment to a person from before a campaign started as a campaign contribution is just nonsense.

Shall we count the number of positive articles from the New York times in favor of Biden as a campaign contribution and prosecute them for not reporting it as such.

Do you not see the ridiculous precedent being set?"
LIBERAL,r/conservative,"Just clarifying that the comment was that ‚ÄúConservatives typically play by and adhere to the systems in place, because they want to preserve what we already had. Leftists openly say that they don't play by the rules because they want an entirely new system to be put in place, so they see no reason to respect the system that it is already in place. It's literally a core tenant of Marxism to do everything in your power to subvert the system in place to bring it down.‚Äù 

The point this individual is attempting to make is that the right cares about the systems in place and the left does not. I was simply pointing out the hypocrisy of a statement of this nature when conservatives - and even many members of conservative leadership who were lying through their teeth solely bc they thought it would help their reelection campaigns - attempted to undo the very foundation of the democratic process this nation depends on. You can try to minimize it and cheekily disregard it, but it happened, and only one side did it."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,Hard times create strong people.  Strong people create good times.  Good times create weak people.  Weak people create hard times.  Take a guess where we are.
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,Every other news network now doing the reverse for Biden. Is this lost on you?
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"The public servants who make up the teachers union are a very powerful and wealthy group. Any politician who takes their campaign contributions and endorsements aint going to rock the boat in favor of kids or their parents. The only way we are ever going to see any reform begin is to end public unions along with campaign reform. BTW, I have no quarrel with Unions for the private sector!"
LIBERAL,r/conservative,"This should also be done to counter Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, etc. But the main problem with TikTok is that when they inevitably continue to do it all they get is a slap on the wrist because they're China."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"Rhetoric. People of all kinds just repeat the rhetoric they hear because it is simple, feeds into their world view, and doesn't require effort. Liberal, Conservative, political, social; whatever group you associate with will have rhetoric and many of the members will just repeat it. 

People who pin their membership in a group like this will often not engage in debate or conversation about the truth of the matter, because it will expose they don't really know what they're talking about. 

Once I determine a person is just going along like this, I don't engage, no matter how infuriating I can find it at times."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,Whatever he drank turned him stupid.
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"What I mean is it's going to accelerate. There's been a brain drain before yes but people declining to even go to colleges or universities in red states, even when it's their home state, is an escalation."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"I don‚Äôt understand why we have to all be lumped together. Also I don‚Äôt really believe all the fad sexualities or gender disorders like QA2S+ are something you are born with. We can‚Äôt change being gay or lesbian. I can‚Äôt tell you how many straight dudes have told me they are they/them or whatever. It‚Äôs insulting and selfish. These straight guys can suddenly not be they/them or gender fluid or whatever. I will always be gay. 

You don‚Äôt get to ride on the coat tails of the real struggle gays and lesbians have had to fight through. You don‚Äôt get a free pass because you are asexual today and non-binary tomorrow and you want to legitimize your selfish movement by saying we are all part of the same community. We are not.

Start your own movement with your own letters. 

Guess what? You‚Äôd be surprised how many gays want nothing to do with the QAI2S+ nonsense and feel the way I do."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,I think he's already done that.
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"Almost feels like if you want to fly the flag today, you need a sign that explains your feelings and disavows certain things."

LIBERAL,r/liberal,"There is nothing inherently sexual about a drag queen in age-appropriate clothing reading an age-appropriate book. 

We all agree that kids shouldn‚Äôt be at an adult drag show. But drag ‚Äî like comedy or any other performance ‚Äî can be for adults or for kids. There‚Äôs no reason it can‚Äôt be unless you‚Äôre just repulsed by the idea of a man in a dress. In which case I‚Äôd encourage you to watch Mrs. Doubtfire ‚Äî a movie for kids ‚Äî and get over yourself."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"The bill makes no distinction between ‚Äúteenage antics‚Äù and ‚Äúdrag performance‚Äù

LIBERAL,r/liberal,Why this legal? They should not allow paying friends and family for campaign work. They either work for free or higher peole who aren't related to the candidate.
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"The irony in all this is the more they try to defend the shooter instead of honoring the fallen, the more hate it's creating towards trans people."

LIBERAL,r/liberal,"It took mainstream media a couple years or more before they dropped the hinting and started calling the lies what they are.

If republicans were forbidden to lie, maybe they would shut up for a change."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"No countries have switched currency - the story is that several countries have agreed to trade with each other in their own currencies, bypassing the US dollar as the world reserve currency.

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,What makes you think that?
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"To be fair, this is regarding **corporate jobs** and not restaurant employees. Having said that, I do feel that fast food as Americans have known it will be largely unrecognizable in the future due to rising costs across the board, including labor. 

I meet a former work colleague for lunch about once a month and we usually go to a Wendy‚Äôs nearby. My last stop there I think there were two menu item meals under $10. Also, due to labor shortages and high turnover for these low level jobs, the quality has never been more hit-or-miss and often takes much longer to prepare, so you‚Äôre paying more for a worse product.

How does fast food as a category survive when it‚Äôs no longer affordable, fast, or as well prepared as before? These corporate layoffs will just be the next wave of this new reality. I think fast casual restaurants will start to be the new normal and that traditional fast food chains who compete primarily on pricing will bite the dust.

EDIT: also, I‚Äôm originally from Pittsburgh, and the last McDonald‚Äôs located in the downtown footprint has or is about to shutter its doors, and locals on the sub-Reddit are cheering about it as if the largest global food chain and its affiliates deciding that your major city is no longer a viable spot to have a business is somehow progress and positive change. Utterly delusional."

LIBERAL,r/liberal,"Too many people on the left side of the spectrum go for the ‚Äúall or nothing‚Äù approach.  We do need serious structural changes to address all the issues you bring up and more. But sudden radical change typically comes with body counts and the resulting chaos ends up being more harmful than the system it replaces.  

Honest small reforms that move the needle are good.  Obamacare was obviously flawed, and a single-payer system would be more beneficial, but you cannot deny that people are better off today because of that law.  Keep working, keep pushing, but don‚Äôt throw away progress just because it doesn‚Äôt solve all problems in one swoop.  

Think of it like football, if you have a chance at a field goal, take it.  Is it as good as a touchdown, no.  But three points is three points.  Take the points, get your defense on the field, and try to get the ball back.  That‚Äôs how you win games."

LIBERAL,r/liberal,"My thoughts exactly. Pence should be investigated as well since classified docs were found at his home. Anyone who does this should be investigated. What I found laughable about Biden was his statement where he said everyone knows that he takes the handling of classified information very seriously. No no no you don't. Not when it's found in your garage, your house, your office and god knows where else. 

From the looks of it, they are all taking classified documents and they all should be held accountable. But will that happen? Very doubtful."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"First, it has been widely acknowledged and demonstrated that this isn't an appication of the law. This is twisting the law in a novel way order to get one man.  This is Banana Republic lawfare and intimidation, period.

Second, this is being used solely against the leading GOP candidate for the next POTUS election. There is no step forward and it isn't being applied to others.

Neither they nor the populace is ""holding Trump accountable"" for anything with this bullshit charge. What it is doing is poisoning democracy. If you want to hold people accountable, there are a slew of sitting and recent functionaries and politicians who could be ""held accountable"" for real crimes but weren't and won't be.

This is about mutilating our system in order to feed antidemocratic psychosis."

LIBERAL,r/liberal,"The __demagogic temerity__ of pugnacious, narcissistic, and want-to-be fascist dictator / defeated grifter and one term former President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice)__ and the imbroglio he has foisted upon our country *knows no bounds.* Guilty __(at the very least) of extreme direlection of duty, his cognitive dissonance __moves forward unchecked.__

The White House and Democrats have come forward, condemning one term former President Trump's (the only president to be impeached twice) disgusting statements.

>*""White House spokesman Andrew Bates said Mr Trump's comments were ""anathema to the soul of our nation"". ""You cannot only love America when you win,"" Mr Bates said in a statement.* 

Saying that our US Constitution should be destroyed is like saying you hate the USA and you are an insurrectionist. And clearly?  President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice)__ truly supports his own narrative that he has been promoting for years.

>*The White House has condemned former President Donald Trump after he called for the ""termination"" of the US constitution.*

Where are the droves of Republicans coming out of the shadows to condemn one term former President Trump's (the only president to be impeached twice) words? Can you imagine if a Democratic candidate for US president spewed forth with this grotesque ideology?

>*In the post, Mr Trump referred to vague allegations of ""massive & widespread fraud and deception"" and asked whether he should be immediately returned to power. ""A Massive Fraud of this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution. Our great 'Founders' did not want, and would not condone, False & Fraudulent Elections!"" he said.*

IMO?

Former President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice)__ is actually laying the groundwork for another insurrection. He is quite succint and has left no doubt in regards to what his intentions are.

Maybe the fawning sychophants of the radical Trumpanzee Republicon right could conjure up a way to debase themselves some more?

And if that's not bad enough? Former President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice)__ claims he had no knowledge of certain people who dined with him. Anyone who knows anything about the Secret Service and the president would know that no one comes near former President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice)__ unless they are veted. For instance? You or I could not just walk up to Mar-a-Lago or anywhere else. and sit down at the same table for a meal. Ye is known for his radical beliefs and hate filled rhetoric and ideology. And he also invited a well know denier.

It's no coincidence that he sat down for a meal with these people right after announcing his intent to enter the election for the office of the US presidency.

>*But he has come under fire this week after dining with a known white nationalist and Holocaust denier at his Florida home. Mr Trump said he was not aware that the man would be present and said he had accompanied the rapper Kanye West - who earlier this week expressed admiration for Adolf Hitler and has been accused of a host of antisemitic comments.*

The Republican Party *currently supports* autocracy, bribes, bullying, cheating, control of a woman's body, dismantling the US Constitution, fascism, fear, fraud, hatred, insurrectionists, racism, stealing top secret government documents, white supremacy, __pursuit of alternative facts (lies)__ and grifting.

When someone tells you who they are the first time? You need to believe them. And that's what America needs to do if they plan on ridding our political offices of these types of influences.

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,">It's called the statue destruction you previously agreed was a good point. That is evidence of the direct consequences of focusing on grievances every American saw with their own eyes. 

As I mentioned previously, we have no idea what the motivation was for the person who destroyed that atatue. It could have been a white leftist 20yo, it could have me a 30yo Indian immigrant with grievances against him, it could have been an arsehole teenager who thought it was funny. You have no evidence that connects the destruction of this statue to the teaching of history in this way.

I'm asking for academic papers that show the teaching of the bad side of historical figures leads to what you claim. I would be very interested to read them.

>Who cares? We're not arguing about whether or not Indians have conflicted opinions of ghandi, we're arguing about whether it's beneficial or not to focus on the flaws of historical figures rather that their accomplishments.

See my point above, the reason I mentioned some Indians disliking him was to point out it may have been Indians who destroyed the statue. Probably not, but it could have been.


>And now that I think of it, what is the point of teaching that? It seems as pointless as teaching that every man before 2000 was a sexist. We don't put an asterisk on MLK's speeches warning that he did some sketchy stuff. We don't put an asterisk on Da Vinci warning that was super whatever-ism and whatever-phobic.

Teaching children about the founding fathers' ownership of slaves is not meant to discredit their contributions to American history, but rather to provide a more complete and accurate understanding of the past. If you DONT teach it, you are lying by omission to the children you are teaching. Similarly, acknowledging Gandhi's flaws does not negate the positive impact he had on India's independence movement, but rather adds depth and complexity to his legacy.

if we only focus on the positive aspects of historical figures, we risk perpetuating harmful myths and ideologies. For example, if we only teach children about the founding fathers' accomplishments and ignore their ownership of slaves, we perpetuate the idea that slavery was not a major part of American history, when in fact it was a central pillar of the nation's economy for centuries. By ignoring this aspect of history, we risk perpetuating racism and other forms of discrimination."

It's the same reason why they set up a house committee to investigate ""weaponization of big government,"" the line is that Republicans are a part of freedom, while Democrats are a party of corruption and abuse of power.  

And to be fair, there's a bit of a point there - there aren't too many people who were Trump supporters earlier this week who are just now thinking ""ooh, maybe this guy isn't too savory.""

I believe in 2 yrs when this circus of a congress is cleaned out, tRamp is in the least under house arrest and Biden feels comfortable enough to retire and turn our country over to a  younger ctizens we will have successfully averted a slow growing coup in this country.

And what about things that aren't about winning: sportsman's-like conduct, most enthusiastic, etc. What about coach awards that aren't based on winning? If this law is passed I see it just as a way for the state to harass races it sponsors and add to the complexity. And what's the problem with celebrating a race if you didn't win.
I really want to hear a conservative argue ""Well Joey just ran a 40 mile marathon that be had to fly 1000 miles for, from Alaska but that's no reason for him to bring anything back because he didn't win."""

CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"I have seen a few of his speeches and he just melts when confronted.

Along with still hiding Covid death numbers, targeting a whistleblower who let the world know that he was hiding Covid numbers and under reporting by having her house raided and her computers seized along with many other things. 

So there's just a lot of ammo that can be used against him and his ""achievements"" are also turn offs for most of the middle ground undecided voters he would have to win over to have a chance. It's not impossible just very unlikely for Desatan to win even the primary as he has to go up against people who probably will have a cleaner look then him with all the things he is currently doing that are viewed by some as fascist."

LIBERAL,r/conservative,How dare you assume their genders
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"I can't engage with that point though? You hadn't mentioned it, however you're not necessarily wrong, with Congress having term limits, that would motivate lobbyists to lobby as much as possible.

States like TN have term limits, and as we know they joined the confederacy.. they've had corruption before term limits..

Many things states do is corrupt however, Kansas'governor made so many promises, Texas and New Mexico may or may not have government authorities connected with the Cartel. :/ And Hawaii's the poorest state, with most of the homeless being natives. 
So from all of that, it seems to me like term limits really don't intertwine in any of the corruption of the states.

I'm open to ideas, and progress, I've observed your concern. 
However, I don't find it all that necessary, as corruption exists even if there's no term limits.. 
Term limits are needed for the president, you haven't shown any non-support of this, but do you agree with the 22 amendment? 
If you can agree with that, then how can you disagree with the same thing for congress members? 
Our government doesn't need aged people in power, I, and many Americans don't want a nursing home as our government. 
Not only that, but term limits welcome new ideas.

Also, term limits are supposed to ensure tranquility, which is what the Constitution claims we must have, '_' are you saying you disagree with the Constitution?

If that's the case, I can't imagine you supporting libertarian ideals.."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"Im not sure what they are trying to achieve hear. We just took all of the harder working or more talented kids put them on the A team and moved them to a more competitive league.

In the good times, a man could support a family and buy a home on one middle class income. People have to work harder for less than any time since the 1950s. The culture has been absolutely rotting in this country since the end of WW2, and accelerated to an ungodly rate in the past decade or two.

CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"Then the ""so called"" left media better start working a lot better on their message about the economy...

""Imagine that your picture of the U.S. economy came entirely from headlines and cable news chyrons. Would you know that real gross domestic product has risen 6.7 percent under President Biden, that America gained 4.5 million jobs in 2022 and that inflation over the past six months, which was indeed very high last winter, was less than 2 percent at an annual rate?  
  
This isn‚Äôt a hypothetical question. Most people don‚Äôt read long-form, data-driven essays on the economic outlook. Their sense of the economy is more likely to be shaped by snippets they read or hear.""

""What about media coverage? Some of my colleagues get upset about any suggestion that economic reporting has had a negativity bias that affects public perceptions. Yet there‚Äôs actually hard evidence to that effect. The Michigan Survey asks respondents about what news they‚Äôve heard about specific business conditions; all through 2022 ‚Äî as the economy added 4.5 million jobs ‚Äî more people reported hearing negative than positive news about employment.""

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"I‚Äôm in law enforcement in NYC and have significant knowledge and experience in this exact topic. It‚Äôs not the DA‚Äôs, ADAs and judges so much as it is the legislature, which enacted a trio of laws recently, that are making it extremely difficult to effectively prosecute criminals and keep the community safe.

1. ‚ÄúRaise the Age‚Äù brought the age of criminal liability from 16 to 18, pushing the majority of 16 and 17 year old criminals into the juvenile delinquency system. Those matters are prosecuted by the City prosecutors in Family Court, rather than by ADAs in Criminal Court and they are not exposed to adult sentencing and there is no bail. Since plenty of violent crime in the City is committed by 16 and 17 year olds, this had pretty obvious negative effects. It‚Äôs not to say the prosecutors and judges aren‚Äôt trying, but the legislature tied their hands.

2. Bail reform. The Legislature made it difficult or impossible to set bail on criminal defendants in most cases. This allows criminal defendants to offend and reoffend without being held on bail. Trust me, the judges and ADAs don‚Äôt like it any more than you do. But again, the legislature‚Ä¶.

3. The new discovery law. Prosecutors need to disclose certain material to the defense within a certain amount of time under NY and Constitutional law. That‚Äôs been the rule forever and it‚Äôs been doable. However, In 2020, the Legislature significantly increased that timeframe to an impossibly fast one that causes lots of cases to be dismissed because ADAs just cannot keep up. This also caused a huge amount of attrition in all the prosecutors‚Äô offices because the job became essentially impossibly and pointless to many attorneys. They left for less stressful and higher paid work in the private sector. There has been a lot of press on that point recently in NYC.

I hope that gives you guys some honest context of the reality here in NYC."

And while he lampooned President Bush in ways that some people would say were deeply disrespectful to the office, let's face it, Dubya tried to hard to spin his public persona and was an eminently memeable figure.

Then Obama won the presidency in 2008 and Colbert did a 180, becoming just another attack dog faithfully serving the administration in power, every night savaging the enemy of the hour. And it's just been downhill since there. I've seen YouTube clips once or twice since 2020 and I don't think he even does any parody at all anymore.

LIBERAL,r/conservative,"Also didn‚Äôt he help with Epstein‚Äôs first trial?

There‚Äôs definitely evidence that Trump was at the very least either put off by his actions or shocked by something.

It‚Äôs also entirely possible at the same time Epstein brought girls to Trump and went way too far or brought something ‚Äúspecial‚Äù or did something that he wasn‚Äôt okay with at all. I. E. Trump was involved but there was a limit. Which could have simply been <18  or <16 or worse. Again it might have seemed like Epstein was an ordinary pimp for the rich and famous.

That he made a decisive action to ban him says something. What that something is I don‚Äôt know. I definitely think Epstein brought girls to him though. The question is were they underage and was that with Trump‚Äôs knowledge. I can definitely see a world where people trusted the pimp for the rich and famous because who would think that someone trusted by others is going to compromise everyone.

I can definitely see someone‚Äôs first trip to the island being a shock too. The repeaters‚Ä¶ I really doubt there‚Äôs anything one could defend them with. The only argument I could think of was the first visit was normal and subsequent ones were more messed up.

Still - why was the closest thing to damming him Trump then? I honestly don‚Äôt think it was a case of nothing happened at the island with most of them‚Ä¶"

The Punks may be one of the last bastions against Fascists in this country, in the end: much like how the anti-Fascist self-defense forces organized by the Communists in pre-Nazi Germany helped significantly slow the rise of the Nazi movement in the 1920's (after 1930 the Fascists started to grow put of control).

For example, Fred Upton or Jaime Herrera Beutler, both of who voted to impeach Trump. Chances are that no Republican will even choose to switch for a sane Republican, but if five or more did that would mean they and the Democrats would organize the House. Committees, chairmanships, etc. And it would make MAGAs very, very unhappy. Even with all the necessary compromises on spending to make this happen it would make the next two years not nearly so bad.

And again, who cares how much you win by if it's already a safe seat. DeWine was a disastrous governor on COVID, I much prefer a very conservative candidate like Vance to win by 6% in a Republican seat than a moderate win by a landslide in a seat that Republicans were always gonna win anyway

I don't think Vance wins without Dewine personally.  Also Vance is more populist than Conservative.

>I'm just saying it's definitely very possible for Trump to win those states that he narrowly lost by, it's not an impossible task. In your original comment you said he basically had 0 chance in these states which I disagree with

2022 gives us more evidence.  The only chance Trump has in those states is a completely collapse of Biden that makes those states meaningless anyways.  

> Suburbs have been shifting democrat long before Trump, he definitely accelerated the trend but you can't pull Bush/Romney suburb margins when the suburns today are significantly less white and more college educated, two demographics that heavily favor dems

Historically college educated was the core GOP Demographic.  The upper middle class bachelors degree family were the most reliable GOP voters.

>Also for Bush and the original question, despite winning 2 elections he never one one of those PA/WI/MI rust belt states which Republicans need in 2024 given how the map has shifted. He came very close in WI tbf, but again Trump is the first Republican since HW in 1988 to win any of those 3 states.



>Again, I was talking about the Midwest in that comment, the white working class rural areas that are Trump's base. If you just look at the Midwest in 2018 and 2022, the House and Senate races are complete disasters because the rural voters simply didn't show up.

They were disasters only in places where Trumpy candidates were nominated.  We walk in AZ for both Governor and Senate if normal people are nominated.  We walk in Georgia if a normal conservative is nominated instead of Walker.  PA should have been a lay-up in the Senate if we didn't nominate the worst possible candidate for both of those races."

3. Some people are obsessed with getting revenge for 2020 and not thinking clearly about the best option.

4. Some people believe Trump has a better shot than DeSantis of attracting blue collar workers in the northern Rust Belt (Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin‚Äîthe Republican basically HAS to win at least one of them to win the election, barring a very narrow path that includes Virginia).

I‚Äôm willing to at least listen to point #4, but even then we don‚Äôt have much data on DeSantis‚Äô appeal or lack of appeal to blue collar workers, and we know Trump brings out a LOT of anti-voters in those key states as well.

Personally I think DeSantis has a much better shot of winning back Arizona and Georgia than Trump does (the former Trump basically poisoned with his anti-McCain rhetoric, and the latter his anti-Kemp rhetoric isn‚Äôt helping). If DeSantis can just do better with suburban women (which I think he objectively should) he has a shot of grabbing at least one of those northern Rust Belt states and the election.

However, high inflation and high unemployment were here during Nixon - Remember his attempt at 'Wage and Price Controls'? or Ford's ""WIN"" buttons?

The stagflation and 'malaise' under Carter set the stage for Reagan's BAD POLICY of borrowing in the name of all and cutting taxes appreciably for a lucky few AKA 'trickle down' - a fancy name for stealing from all to give to a few. The nation's tax policy has been stuck in that groove for 43 years. It's up to us to end it by only voting in politicians who are willing to end it.

Before Reagan, this raid on the Treasury would have been UNTHINKABLE and was the first step in the immiseration of the middle class. $30 trillion borrowed over 43 years is the same as borrowing $50 per week from EVERY AMERICAN alive for or born since the Reagan Inauguration...approx 11.6 billion person years. $112,000 from each American alive for the entire 43 years.

LIBERAL,r/liberal,"I was raised Catholic and I also was taught to think for myself (I'm so thankful for those nuns -- they were great).  And I agree with you about mainstream Protestant groups.  But these days they are not nearly as much in the majority as you may think.  In ten years, I suspect they won't be in the majority at all.  It's why people like me look at *The Handmaid's Tale* as predictive rather than fictional.  That said, I applaud your idealism; it's a great thing to see in young people (and I'm assuming you are younger than I, since I'm elderly)."

The DoD would have really have gone completely brain dead if they supported such an act. Look at when Trump decided to pull out of Syria and leave the Syrian Kurds to Turkey and how the brass acted after that. This would be infinitely worse than that.

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,Just another day in the life of a liberal
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"For why the 2nd Amendment exists, you‚Äôd probably need to ask a historian for a more specific answer. I think that the historical consensus is that it was not initially written as a means to protect individual use of firearms but rather the existence of a ‚Äúwell-regulated militia‚Äù composed of citizens that made a standing army unnecessary. This was because of the initial paranoia of tyranny that followed the Revolutionary War.

Unfortunately, subsequent judicial review does declare that most restrictions on individual gun ownership is unconstitutional, especially in relatively recent court cases such as NYSRPA v. Bruen, even though this is probably historically misinformed. Not that treating the Constitution as some sort of dogma is historically accurate or an intelligent thing to do in itself."

>BERLIN. Dec 20.‚ÄîAdolph Hitler, once the demigod of the reactionary extremists, was released on parole from imprisonment at Fortress Landsberg, Bavaria, today and immediately left in an auto for Munich. He looked a much sadder and wiser man today than last Spring when he, with Ludendorff and other radical extremists, appeared before a Munich court charged with conspiracy to overthrow the Goverment.

>His behavior during imprisonment convinced the authorities that, like his political organization, known as the V√∂lkischer, was no longer to be feared. It is believed he will retire to private life and return to Austria, the country of his birth.

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,When exactly? Please list specific dates. Any national gun legislation would inevitably face a filibuster so they would need 60 votes in the senate.

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Context is key. Most, if not all, of these things are present in all people. Everyone experiences these things at some point in life.

As someone who is in personal therapy and who has worked with, and continues to work with, people with a variety of special needs and diagnoses, I can tell you that all of these things are goals that can be worked on with professionals.

LIBERAL,r/liberal,"Imposing your beliefs is not a pastors job. It is to lead worship and to harness the faith of the congregation to do the outreach that is described in the stories of the Bible, Quran, Torah, etc. 

I do understand why people think that way because so many out there are doing it for the profitability and the prestige of the position."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"This is why Charlie Kirk, Matt Walsh & Steven Crowder visiting universities is a great plan. These kids will be the next CEOs; department leads; managers; HR leads; Chairmans etc. But if we don't challenge these delusions and try to change the atmosphere, then they will destroy our society.

University used to be the making of the country's best and brightest; the ones to lead us into the future. Now, it's chock-a-block full of people who think a small seat in a waiting room is a fatphobic microaggression."

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,Fed should leave this state to suffer in their own ignorance
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"This might have been their plan the whole time.  Take a case the state will likely lose and use it as a vehicle to place gag orders on a presidential candidate throughout the election.  

It has been reported that the trial might not even take place until after the election so that would give democrats the ability to prevent trump from speaking on anything that is polling well for him (like weaponization of government, political persecution, etc)."
LIBERAL,r/conservative,"Here is their stance summed up in a few sentences:

""Our hearts go out to the trans community as they are under attack right now. But this is a president who has said many times before he has their backs, he will continue to have their backs, and he will continue to fight for them.""

LIBERAL,r/conservative,I agree but if we are going to make statements on science and fact we should be correct. Especially when the other side isn't being correct.

CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"They voted for Trump sight unseen. That is ridiculous enough. What's even worse is that many of them are buying Trump NFT's and shares in DWAC without doing even the littlest bid of due diligence. They're boasting about spending their families' savings and mortgaging their homes on these sketchy ""investments"". The raw data is out there now in his tax returns, yet I doubt they'll be curious enough to even look into them."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,They're actually being very vocal about this one specifically because the shooter was trans.
LIBERAL,r/liberal,I don‚Äôt necessarily disagree with you. I just think it will be hard to get a good candidate who is also separated strongly from religion.

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Showing up late to work regularly, disorganization, lack of emotional regulation, etc (and using neurodivergence as an excuse) is degenerated.  You're not entitled to being coddled like a child, especially from your employer.  We all have flaws, but it's incumbent on all of us to do our best to overcome them (not embrace them as neurodivergent).  Divergence from what is efficient, regulated, and organize that facilitates being a fully self-actualized human being is degenerated.  Overlooking some divergence is necessary, but if it becomes a habit that inhibits workplace effectiveness, then pushback is necessary from your supervisor.  Pre-dispositions are just that, they only become destiny if we allow them to be."

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Gotcha, so a bi-line was pulled out of context, put into an image and then the president's and first lady's signature were forged. All to make it seem like this statement was made in response to the shooting (e.g., instead of acknowledging the victims of the shooting, the WH made this statement instead)

The *real* story is this one-liner was pulled from a WH statement that was made during Transgender Day of Visibility and has *nothing* to do with the shooting or mentions the shooting.

Fox News is trying to make a connection to purposely further polarizing the left and right."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"I'm curious where you got the idea that liberals support illegal immigration. 

Kinda the same with second amendment. The line isn't no guns, it's more like maybe we shouldn't have access to military firearms over the counter. I'm in a rural area and I don't know a single liberal who doesn't own a gun, and a great many enjoy shooting. 

Lastly the economic stuff. I know it's cynical but my view is the government is gonna take your money, like it or not. Your choice in the matter is how they use it, not if they take it.

I'm not trying to razz you just reading through your replies and commenting a little. Thanks for being willing to engage in debate!"

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,I agree.  Private schools should be able to secure themselves as they seem fit.  Government to be honest shouldn‚Äôt even set guidelines as that will just give an excuse to govern them.
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"1) It seems they are getting away with it.
2) Women vote against women's rights.  They know who and what their voters are.  And they don't care about all the issues you raised.

LIBERAL,r/liberal,"Yeah I think the left has turned into as much of a mob as the right wing has. It seems like they just want to Lynch people.

I think it's just a progression of events. 10 years ago, conservatives kept attacking ""sjws"" online. And usually sjw's were actually not doing anything wrong. But because the American culture supports Petty shitty behavior, the bullies attacking liberals were not shut down like they should have been.

But of course the social justice Warriors had righteous conviction on their side. Like, if you see somebody committing a crime and you know it's wrong, just because somebody calls you a mean name doesn't mean you're going to stop standing up for a victim. So, both sides in this conflict kept up their perspective. The social justice Warriors kept trying to be activists and their critics continued to try and Bully them.

So, people who weren't really social justice Warriors and weren't really bullies either, felt the need to join in one way or the other. And so we ended up with these Petty ""normal"" people joining the causes of the social justice warriors. So, they ended up taking over and now the left has got this lynching mob that goes from celebrity to celebrity trying to cancel everybody. And I mean, a lot of the times they're not wrong. I mean JK Rowling is kind of being a jerk about trans people. But then to call her anti-semitic because her goblins run banks? That is really a stretch. There's no evidence that she's doing that as a reference to Jewish people. And that's just one example.

""One of Roosevelt's central beliefs was that the government had the right to regulate big business to protect the welfare of society. However, this idea was relatively untested. Although Congress had passed the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890, former Presidents had only used it sparingly. So when the Department of Justice filed suit in early 1902 against the Northern Securities Company, it sent shockwaves through the business community. The suit alarmed the business community, which had hoped that Roosevelt would follow precedent and maintain a ""hands-off"" approach to the market economy. At issue was the claim that the Northern Securities Company‚Äîa giant railroad combination created by a syndicate of wealthy industrialists and financiers led by J. P. Morgan‚Äîviolated the Sherman Antitrust Act because it was a monopoly. In 1904, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of the government and ordered the company dismantled. The high court's action was a major victory for the administration and put the business community on notice that although this was a Republican administration, it would not give business free rein to operate without regard for the public welfare.""

She is not complicit in anything Biden did as VP.  There's literally nothing to dishonor her reputation in the least bit and she would definitely see accepting the role as president as the honorable thing to do in the highly unlikely event that Biden were to resign.  

Honestly, no matter how hard they try, the house probably won't even get enough votes for an impeachment over this.

CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"Sure yes, Trump is bad and did wrong. But he‚Äôs not president anymore. Plus he‚Äôs dumb right?

Trump was successful at tanking trust in MSM. Their polling is nearly as bad as congress due to his war with them.

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,">The key insight here is that this move indicates that the US values Japan over Europe.

I gotta disagree. What this actually indicates is that in East Asia, unlike Europe, there are major industrialized countries which are not aliged with the West (read: China) and would be willing to buy up this oil and LNG if Japan/SK don't want it. (The supplies we're talking about here are produced in Russia's Far East.)

In Europe, there are no nearby alternative customers the Russian's could turn to. Instead, they now have to ship the oil and natural gas which were previously going a short distance to Europe (from oil and gas fields in the European parts of Russia!)  half-way around the globe to China or India, increasing the shipping and insurance costs and restricting the capacity.

So the key difference is that the West/the US/NATO have hegemony over all of Europe to the west of Belarus, while East Asia is geopolitically divided between our adversaries (China, NK) and our allies (Japan, SK)."

Public transit makes sense where it is needed. Chicago is a poorly governed city of late but that is a reflection on the DAs, the mayor, the justice system etc, not on the concept of public transit.     

Of course, similarly, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to spend money on building train tracks for commuter transit in rural Pennsylvania for the tiny population that wants to go from point A to point B daily. They can drive."

And with a large conspiracy like this, I'm sure their lawyers are telling them, the first ones to make a deal get the best deals.

From what little we've heard, it really does seem like Pence always resisted the notion of stealing the election with Trump's various coup schemes. So Pence won't have any reason to take the fifth. That has to scare the crap out of some of them.

CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"I live in Thailand.  The lion share of people give absolutely zero fucks on how a person identifies or who they love.  Everyone is busy with their own life so it's not much of an issue which is great because all the crazy shit going down in America just doesn't  relate here too much. One point in resolution is marriage rights which will be solved at some point in the near future. 

Here's an interesting rub. Recently there has been a western influenced push (and quickly kicked to the curb) that drag shows are demeaning to trans people. Keep in mind these are actually tourist family friendly shows and such that have been around many many years. Many are next level talent as well.

Idk, found it interesting that some in the western movement would take this route given it's a society that is pretty open to things. Seems the push was from angry woke tourists which isn't new, maybe culturally adapting was a challenge or they missed the fight in a place that really doesn't have one.  Some folks just don't want to be happy was my take away."

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Is that like the lack of introspection from ""not fraud"" supporters when, to be able to make any semblance of a point, they have to ignore massively significant voting procedures changes toward less election security?

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"The question though, is if we fully embrace a tit-for-tat approach, rejecting the concept of Right and Wrong in favor of 'there is no truth, only power and the will to use it,' then does that give the postmodernists the win by default?  If its all morally relative and the *only* thing that matters is winning, then its nothing but red team blue team and who gets power?  I'm not saying do nothing, and actions have to have consequences, BUT its a hell of a tightrope to walk, and if it becomes a fight of principles-be-damned then that throws out the people where principles are what drive them and weaken your own alliance in the name of a cathartic release."

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"I understand that you did that because of the way the system works, and I understand not wanting your school district to suffer. However the fact of the matter is millions of kids in your country are suffering due to the way this system is set up. Poor kids are not given a fair or equitable education based purely on their district. I come from the UK, and the system there works as described. All taxes in the country for education are equally distributed based on a per student basis. That way, every child gets the same amount of funding and eductation offered by the goverment regardless of their backgroud. If you want private education, it is available and you can pay for it."

Don‚Äôt underestimate the power of propaganda, the loyalty to gun culture or the absolute madness that comes from religion.  Also human beings are dumb mother fuckers myself included."
LIBERAL,r/conservative,"Poverty is heavily tied to the welfare system. Dems should stop supporting the federal welfare system and federal school system. Poor people become richer the more they do for themselves. Goverment handouts only make people poorer since they stop doing for themselves.

As for the schools, the schools only survive if they have parents paying for their kids to be there. If the school has to depend on the community with no funding from the government, what do you think 'tuition' will look like? ""Rich people"" don't live in the hood -- if the school is in the hood, it has to depend on the parents.

As for climbing the social ladder, that happens primarily as an outgrowth of a solid two-parent household. People learn work ethic and financial discipline, and it mostly happens in the home. That has nothing to do with school.

EDIT: downvoting trolls/socialists *reaaaallly* don't want to give up their ""free"" goodies that my taxes paid for."

LIBERAL,r/liberal,"Tbh I agree that there is a lot of hatred on both sides and that we both have our hypocrites. Politics in America have never been so polarized. (Or maybe across the world, too, but I wouldn't know that intimately)

To me though, I believe conservatives win on the hypocrite fight, as they want to brand themselves as the party of free speech, but are out there banning books and drag performances and whatnot and championing Christianity when our very foundation has been one of religious freedom.

LIBERAL,r/conservative,"Gender Identity =/= Gender. The former was invented by leftist academics in the middle of the 20th century. Once people start to understand that, this whole subject goes away. That's why ""Gender Identity"" has such things as ""Feykind"" and the like. 

Gender Identity is like Social Justice. As in the word they are modifying is made absolutely irrelevant to what they are creating. Social Justice is the opposite of Justice, it has no relevance to it. Gender Identity is in a similar boat.

The left has been misusing and manipulating language for decades. This is how they get people confused enough to go along with their bad ideas. Linguists won't correct them, even though they are intentionally misusing language. The reason being is that they think language naturally evolves (which it does). But what the left has been doing it prescriptive astroturf language changes in order to manipulate public opinion into support their radical beliefs.

Gender Identities are stereotypes of certain identities, acting as a pseudo personality. We used to call this insulting. We still do. It's group think, as they get to force people to ""act"" a certain way based on said identity."

CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"Prior to Trump, I recall republicans having an air of superiority rather than this modern bullying behavior. On topics like abortion and gay marriage they‚Äôd have this smug attitude that they knew they were in the right because they had a hotline to the jeebus. Another big difference was that republicans were all a bunch of sticks in the mud- they were against drinking, pot, casual sex, and anything fun. I recently heard Joe Rogan saying he was a conservative because he likes to ‚Äúdrink beer and watch sports‚Äù‚Ä¶ huh? As GenX I grew up with Reagan inspired conservatives that seemed to make ‚Äúboring‚Äù their defining characteristic. The xenophobia and the prosperity theology were always a part of it. But they were conservative as the name implies- they believed men were to wear suits & ties and women should be in dresses past the knees. Never in a million years would I have thought those republicans would support a pussy grabbing, grifter, narcissist.
I think a lot of MAGA republicans previously had no interest in politics. Trump came along and gave them permission to be bigots and assholes and it was the rallying cry they were waiting for. This, of course, works well for the rich GOP members who have always manipulated the narrative so that their real politics (keeping the rich rich) wasn‚Äôt discussed. My father was 67 when Trump ran for president and he never once talked about politics before that. Now he‚Äôs a full fledged MAGA idiot. For as much as he says he‚Äôs into politics He couldn‚Äôt tell you a fucking thing about actual policy or how the government works."

That‚Äôs fine, I set up that they get a pass to come in at 9:30. Come in at 9:36? Late and it follows the same consequences as the other staff. The key with ADA is that the person needing the accommodation has to request it, be specific with their needs, and it has to be reasonable and not cause undo difficulty for the employer, but most importantly they still need to be able to accomplish the job they are being paid for."

Dancing provocatively does not accomplish that.

LIBERAL,r/conservative,"Ok, well lets take that and dig into it then.

First, sure. They included 19 year olds, in their study of causes of deaths internationally. Then they ranked it.

https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/issue-brief/child-and-teen-firearm-mortality-in-the-u-s-and-peer-countries/

The first thing that jumps out here, is using the same age brackets (because countries outside of the US often consider anyone under 20 to be an adolescent), we see that no other country has firearms in the top 3 causes of death. If you're using the same numbers, why are we worse than everyone else?

The rest of my arguments are still sound. 

Following every previous school shooting in the last few years, Republican members of congress have called for both a ""return of god to the classroom"" and for teachers and staff to be armed. The comments that appear on this sub generally just say that these shootings only happen in gun free zones.

This was not a gun free zone. The staff was armed. The school was a Christian school, that the shooter had actually attended. 

The Republicans in congress said ""this would not happen"" if the teachers were armed, or god was in the classroom. This still happened. 

When can we be grown ups about this, and acknowledge that some people shouldn't have guns? 

Like, what about pedophiles? Should they be allowed to carry guns? Furries? Homeless people screaming ""I am God"" on the sidewalk? Unmedicated bipolar schizophrenics? 90 year old war vets with dimentia? We won't let them drive, but should we let them keep an AR15 in the nursing home?

That is the conversation that the rest of us are trying to have, because we already knew that bibles and armed lunch ladies don't stop school shootings.

If you don't want liberal kids or conservative kids shot in their classrooms, then you need to support changes that can actually make a difference. Because none of those armed teachers did shit."

AZ in 2022 had the super trumpy Kari Lake who was awful in many regards lose by only 17,000 votes. Masters got fucked though by a good well funded incumbent. In GA Kemp easily won but the trumpy candidate Herschel Walker who could barely speak only lost by 40k votes or 1% in the main election (runoff was worse). In NV Republicans actually won the governor and lost the senate seat, both very narrowly 

Again, I‚Äôm not claiming personally that Trump is the best option or will win all of these states. I‚Äôm just being reasonable enough to understand that narrowly losing states by >1% or tens or thousands of votes doesn‚Äôt mean that the states are lost forever and trump has 0% chance of winning them. And Republicans for the past like decade or two have a terrible track record in the rust belt usually not even being close except for 2016 and 2020, Trump seems to have some sort of appeal there when he‚Äôs on the ballot that drives out working class rurals.

And also again, there‚Äôs a difference between trumpism and trump. In 2022 we saw candidates who were not Trump face all the downsides of him without the upside of juiced rural numbers. The pro-Trump idea is that 2016 and 2020 show that when Trump himself is on the ballot it goes much better than weak midterms in 2018 and 2022"

American conservatives seem to strongly value the Constitution that founded the nation and made it successful, and the Constitution was written by people that clearly had libertarian values (after all, they were trying to form their own nation and make it significantly different than Britain who they separated from.

The ‚Äúliberals‚Äù and ‚Äúleftists‚Äù are in the authoritarian-left category of the political compass whereas conservatives are in the libertarian-right.
I would estimate 90% of people fall into either the authoritarian-left or the libertarian-right, although I know several people who would fall into the libertarian-left category."

>For people with gender dysphoria, they truly believe they are not their

treatment regimen. These are highly trained medical professionals   
evaluating each case performing the evaluations and subsequent treatment  
 plan.

1. The majority of children with gender dysphoria desist by the end of puberty without interventions like hormone blockers and 'gender affirming' nonsense.  The overwhelming majority desist.  That means that they no longer experience or feel it and are just fine by the end of puberty.
2. We don't play along with other dysphorias and cheer and help children continue such dysphorias.  We don't do it for people with body dysphorias like trans-abled people or children with anorexia.  We don't do that for any otehr mental problem like schizophrenia either.  We don't cheer anorexic girls and tell them that yes they are indeed as fat as they think and they should go ahead and lose all the weight they want and support them as they do so.  We don't chop off people's arms because they believe their abled bodies are wrong and that they should be disabled.  We don't cheer schizophrenic people and agree with them that they have real other people inside their heads.  We give them actual mental treatment, and help them with their mental problems instead of applauding and encouraging them in those problems."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"Cannons were privately owned during the revolutionary war. From my brief search out of curiosity, All the way up to 1812 there are records of private cannon ownership. I didn‚Äôt bother looking for more. If you‚Äôre arguing that a certain type of bullet should prevent gun ownership. Why isn‚Äôt lethality/damage range/splash damage considered? It isn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs simply a matter of discussing who gets the right to have the means of defending themselves.

Also, in reference to ‚Äúbullets were created after the constitution was written.‚Äù  Argument. That‚Äôs a slippery slope - I would contend that none of the founding fathers presumed there would be no further tech development in any realm that the constitution addresses. They were all relatively intelligent, highly educated business owners and (some) inventors, especially for their time period. I doubt they thought tech had peaked for humanity in 1776. 

Gun Fudds will argue that if the second amendment applies only to muzzle loading muskets then freedom of speech/press only applies to a printing press and quill and ink. This is just the vicious cycle people often trap their debates in. It‚Äôs pointless and aggravating. Even the idea that founding fathers only meant freedom of assembly for meeting in the time squares/taverns/churches is probably the one constitutionally protected actions the founding fathers would be most surprised about how things have developed- proof of that is this discussion right here, we are assembled on a subreddit discussing politics over electric mediums -likely hundreds of miles away from each other.  ü§Ø 

There is violence everywhere, shootings and stabbings and clubs can be found anywhere there is a human population. I grew up in countries with strict gun laws.

LIBERAL,r/liberal,"Over and over again? Private individuals and numerous groups have filed lawsuits to protect voting rights. 

>*For decades, private individuals and groups, who did not represent the federal government, have filed the majority of Section 2 lawsuits that have stopped state and local governments from minimizing the political power of people of color through the redrawing of voting maps and other steps in the elections process. But that longstanding practice may be coming to an end.*

Why are private individuals not being allowed to protest and sue to fight for their rights like anyone else?

*""It keeps me up at night,"" says Doug Spencer, an associate professor of law at the University of Colorado, who tracks voting rights lawsuits and is concerned about the argument not to allow private individuals to sue under Section 2. ""If that process is taken off the table, then the protection of minority voting rights will be much weaker after that case than it was before,"" Spencer adds. ""This is one important thread that could unravel what remains of the Voting Rights Act.""*

One piece at a time? Voting rights are being destroyed all across America.

>*In the lawsuit, groups representing Black voters in Arkansas claim that Republican politicians on Arkansas' apportionment board had drawn a map of state House districts that dilutes the voting power of Black people, denying Black communities meaningful opportunities to elect representatives of their choice.*

Why is  SPOTUS seemingly supporting the dismanyling of viter rights?

>*Pam Karlan - a professor at Stanford University Law School who, before stepping down last year, helped lead the department's Civil Rights Division as the principal deputy assistant attorney general appointed by President Biden - says beyond limited resources, there's also the challenge of the ""sheer volume of jurisdictions in the United States that might face a Section 2 case.# ""There are states, counties, school boards, water districts, city councils. I mean, there are just so many different governmental bodies that are subject to Section 2 that the idea that you'd have one body in the Justice Department as the sole enforcement mechanism makes no sense at all,"" says Karlan, who declined to comment on why the DOJ decided not to take on the Arkansas case.*

How many districts (that have been redrawn) will need to file law suits to ensure their voting rights are protected?

And why deny the individuals (whose rights are being destroyed) the ability to pursue legal remedies to retain their voting rights?

>*""I think it's an open question only in the sense that no court has ever felt compelled to expressly say that people whose voting rights have been violated can sue under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act because everyone - and I do mean everyone - understood that that's what Congress meant,"" says Dan Tokaji, dean of the University of Wisconsin Law School, who has written about private individuals suing for violations of federal election laws.*

If we don't stand up now? And fight for the voting rights of all of us? Then they will be lost for all of us.

>*If the Arkansas lawsuit ultimately reaches the U.S. Supreme Court, it may join a list of cases that have resulted in a steady chipping away of Voting Rights Act protections by the conservative-majority court under Chief Justice John Roberts.*

And that's sad for Arkansas and America."

Democrats need to work fast on getting a replacement and it seems they're courting Gavin Newsom, the Governor of California. I hate the guy. A lot of people don't like him here, but it's a ""vote blue no matter who"" situation that he's coasted on. You need more than that during a presidential run.

He's shmarmy, hypocritical, and has a car salesman feel to him. He vacillates based on public opinion--science, numbers and facts will always lose out here. He will tank in all traditional red states. He will flounder in blue states with a strong blue collar back bone. He may be too west coast for east coast liberals. However, some democrats are courting him for a potential run and it is a bad fucking idea. Newsom was already running ads against DeSantis during the summer of 2022, which confused a lot of Californians and, in the end, was made fun of for jumping the gun.

Biden won't make it to another election, I don't think the party will allow it, but I don't see anyone viable as of yet and election season is closing in fast."

LIBERAL,r/conservative,">LED light bulbs 'currently cost more than incandescent bulbs and are **inferior**,' consumer groups said in letter to U.S. Department of Energy

I have LED bulbs in most of my lighting throughout my home, with a few exceptions (i.e., the light inside the stove, oven hood, etc). How are they ""*inferior*"" to incandescent bulbs? They last longer, are dimmable across a wider range of brightness, use less energy, and the ones I have are BT/voice controlled, are automated to turn on/off in certain order at given times of day. They are pricey, though. 

>Overall, **47% use mostly or only LEDs**, 15% use mostly incandescent or halogens, and 12% use mostly or all compact fluorescent (CFL), with another **26% reporting no predominant bulb type**, the federal data showed. 

So almost half already use LED, and over a quarter probably have no idea what they use. Which leaves about a quarter divided between incandescent/halogen and CFLs."

I saw a documentary once that featured a 15 year old girl who had this nagging feeling that she should have been a boy. As it turns out, she was born intersex and the doctor removed the male organs thus turning the baby into a girl.

For people with gender dysphoria, they truly believe they are not their assigned gender. They don't just wake up one day and begin a gender transition program. They have to undergo considerable psychological & medical evaluations before any medical doctor will prescribe any treatment regimen. These are highly trained medical professionals evaluating each case performing the evaluations and subsequent treatment plan.

By turning gender dysphoria into a political issue, the harm to children with this disorder could possibly be self-inflicted harm that could result in death. Unfortunately, many of these politicians claiming to be saving children from harm actually don't care about the true cost of the legislation they are pushing."

That's the level they and everyone else ""accept"" others at when they're not really interested.  Civility is literally what *civil*ization is built on.

They're talking about more than basic considerations and even accommodation requirements.

""Accept neurodivergent realities""  I already do this, I accept reality.  Singular.  There is only one.  Delusion does not create some splinter or alternate reality.

No one gets a seat at the table, respect, or ""acceptation"" by default.  These things are typically earned, not granted out of hand.

[Acceptation](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/acceptation) ACCEPTANCE *especially* : favorable reception or approval

I use that variation because it is precisely what they mean.  Approval, validation, positive reaction

It is a narcissistic manipulation at root.

>""If you don't make me feel special, you get punished!""

That's the thought process.

They're *not* actually neurodivergent enough to say that out-loud, apparently they are capable of seeing it as bad...but they want to express it anyways, so they run it through the PR filter to try to sneak it past.

>""If you're not inclusive, that is... *problematic*.""

Nevermind that it is clearly a double standard, inherently not even equitable, much less equality minded.  The woke null state, their default scenario, is that some people are more deserving than others, almost as if they were born into it, like they are aristocrats."

We need to do a great many things but that is not going to happen as long as the American people keep flopping back and forth preventing either party from delivering or accomplishing more that the bare minimum. Historically the economy and human rights do better under Democrats but they are blocked every 2 years. Decades ago they tried to deal with climate change, immigration reform and other national interests. They keep getting slapped down for it so back away.

China also imports the vast majority of raw materials most importantly fuel and food. They are terrified of the losing those imports because they can't survive without those imports currently. There is more but you get my point. Yes we have extreme domestic issues and that is what I am most fearful of. We have the ability and means to be food and fuel independent and still have vast access to raw materials and one of the most skilled and efficient  work forces on earth but we restrict ourselves and tie our hands behind our back.

Biden's actions are a perfect example of what the right and honorable thing to do in the situation and Trump's actions are a perfect example of what the wrong and dishonorable thing to do in the situation.

Also... so far what charges have been brought against Trump for his theft of classified documents? Why hasn't he faced any consequences yet?

Chinese will bribe people in positions of power to gain influence. They may bribe enough politicians in Japan to ask US to leave. Similarly they will get Taiwan to merge with China by bribing almost all the politicians in Taiwan parliament.

Only answer is maintain US influence in the region of South China Sea. And bribe more. But Brandon has slowly destroyed US influence in the region. I was excited when Trump announced China as the real threat."

>‚ÄúSo an esteemed law professor and prolific author is an idiot?‚Äù

Is also just about as meaningless as the gibberish analogies and parables Walker was trying to say.  

Getting a degree and excelling in a narrow and particular area of law does not mean that you're overly intelligent, or even that you necessarily make good decisions. Even getting published isn't all that difficult, lots of stuff that's either erroneous, poorly thought out, or already well known gets published every year.    
An example from Warren's work:  
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Warren
>According to Warren and economists who follow her work, one of her key insights was that rising bankruptcy rates were caused not by profligate consumer spending but by middle-class families' attempts to buy homes in good school districts  
  
So they decided the bankruptcies they examined  weren't from excessive consumption, *they were from buying nicer homes than they could afford*. Which is still a form of excessive consumption because it is still living beyond your means, and I'd wager that if you dig into their data the same people likely also had excessive credit card debt from trying to cover other expenses, like some consumer goods, because the money which would normally cover some of them was being eaten up by their excessive mortgages.  
In the real world bankruptcies are virtually never from a single cause, they are instead usually the result of emergencies tipping over years of accumulated poor financial decisions.
 In 1989 when Warren and her coauthors published their book nobody but those in academia would have found the idea that people were overextending themselves to buy in better neighborhoods surprising, even the politicians talking about overconsumption probably knew that, I certainly did because I knew people who had done it and I was barely old enough to buy beer."

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Well, you're basing this off the actions of one person or a small group of people who did this damage for any number of reasons. There were plenty of groups inside of India that were very against the idea of partition and against ghandi for ideological reasons. Hell, I'm studying engineering and I personally know some Indian exchange students on my course that really do not like ghandi. Im sure there are american children of indian immigrants to the USA that hold these values too. My point being we don't actually KNOW why they beheaded this statue or who did it.

However that said, I really do politely disagree that teaching people the bad parts of historical figures is too their detriment, nor do I disagree with a new generation coming in and saying ""well, I understand he did X but because of Y I don't feel he should be idolised with a statue"". Not that that means we should have vandalism,  just that each generation sees things differently, and should not be forced to continue to praise or idolise people just because the previous generations did. I don't believe teaching the bad parts is ""to the detriment"" of the good parts. In this case, clearly someone took onus to the statue, but this is not universal. By your logic, we should stop telling children that the founding fathers owned slaves."

LIBERAL,r/liberal,"From an economics and motivational theory prospective this could be bad.  


The reason business owners get so much of the money compared to their employees is because they take on the initial risk. Risk is really valuable in a thriving economy. Those that are very successful are risk takers and are comfortable with failure historically. However, according to theories on human motivation such as a anything incorporating a cost/benefits analysis. Humans will consider the benefits of their action against the cost.   


The vast majority of millionaires and billionaires in the USA are self made and the way they do it is that at the start they weigh the benefit of starting a business (being rich) with the failure (having to start over), and they are okay to put 10 thousand hours into something and then start over. If we add the idea that if they file bankruptcy they cannot start over, it drastically changes the cost and will discourage many from starting one to begin with, ultimately harming the economy as we see less successes."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"Yep. Though that's the case on both sides. The Republican advantage, though, is that they can give what they want to their donors (e.g., tax cuts) and sell it philosophically to the voters (e.g., small government, individual liberty, personal responsibility, the invisible hand, etc.). A Dem has to convince middle and sub-middle classes that they're going to fight for things like higher minimum wage, Medicare for all, more affordable post-secondary education, cheaper pharmaceuticals, etc., all the while making it perfectly clear to Aetna, Pfizer, university system donors, etc that they won't actually do this stuff."

LIBERAL,r/conservative,"Well, there are two problems with this. It's not how many votes you get, it's how many votes you get relative to the other guy.

No Republican has gotten 74 million votes, but no Republican has had an opponent getting 81 million votes either.\*

If Trump's 74 million votes makes him more popular than Obama, then Biden's 81 million votes makes him more popular than Obama too, and there's just no way in hell he is. Can't compare Reagan to Trump either because in the 1980s the US population was 68% what it was in 2020 -- adjusted for population, Reagan got the equivalent of 76-78 million votes in 1984.

\* I don't want to get into the whole ""election rigging"" discussion because assuming that it was rigged does us no favors; even if it was, what's the alternative? Stay home and not vote?

And also assuming 2020 was rigged, then let's use 2016 as the example where Trump won -- Clinton got 65 million votes to Trump's 62 million even though Trump won more states; does that mean Clinton was as popular as Obama in 2012? I really don't think so."

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"For context for non-Canadians, when the carbon tax was introduced, people rightfully called out that it would increase the cost of living.

Our government claimed that people would get rebates after filing taxes and the rebates would on average equal more than what they paid in carbon taxes, thus only financially punishing businesses who pollute.

This was BS, as what they sited for how they determined how much people should receive didn‚Äôt in fact take into account all aspects of what the carbon tax would hit.  Which was basically everything.

The government watch dog office that is appointed by the Prime Minister (in this case Trudeau) came out with a report that stated actually over 60% of Canadians would not benefit from the rebate because they ‚Äúmake too much‚Äù, the amount of rebate is based on your income, with the lowest income earners getting the most.

Now with inflation (that they caused) ontop of a crumbling economy (that they caused), the latest increase to our carbon tax now puts majority of the Canadians now paying more than even the rebate can supposedly offset.  So far it‚Äôs at best 20% of Canadians see any benefit from the rebate.

but now i wonder why they did it"
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Well said. California was a great place to live for the middle class until the elites moved in and tried to find a ‚Äúhigher purpose.‚Äù When money comes easily to them by preying on future generations, people need something to do and hence we have wokeism."

CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,It's just like CRT. They can't define it but they know it's bad.
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"I work in a university and consider myself a liberal, but DeSantis is rightly worried about too many resources going to D&I in universities. It's gotten to a point where nearly every college has to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions, for administrators and programs that don't end up in the sciences and other worthy disciplines. D&I programs work their way into the hiring practices which turn each department into an affirmative action, quota-seeking body. They will literally post ""diversity hire"" in the job description which basically means, ""no white people."" It's racism in plain view. And that's just the tip of the iceberg."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,It‚Äôs impacting me in Orlando as well.
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"They're only considered more of a right-wing thing to the right wing. As is the case with many terms in politics, the right and the left argue about the same term using different definitions.

The right lumps all issues related to ""I can't say X"" into free speech. This means they consider things like getting banned on social media or ""canceled"" by a business as things that have to do with free speech.

The left specifically refers to the constitutional right to free speech. If the \*government\* punishes you for your speech, that's a violation of free speech.

Both sides believe they are better for free speech. Both sides are probably right based on their definitions."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,Well talk to the judge who allowed him to roam free during his hearing. He didn‚Äôt escape he walked away unnoticed. The death penalty wouldn‚Äôt have changed those events.

LIBERAL,r/liberal,"I‚Äôll give you this to consider: our daughter was a HS principal.  Parent came in to talk about their kid‚Äôs failing grades.  Not believing the principal‚Äôs reasons for their child‚Äôs failing grades, the parent stood up, and took a swing at the principal across the desk separating them.  The parent was the child‚Äôs mother.  Our daughter is no longer in the public education system.  Ask around‚Ä¶violence against teachers, principals, and other educational staff is escalating.  It‚Äôs one reason educational staff is leaving in droves."

LIBERAL,r/liberal,I do think a lot of them don't understand what a pre-existing condition is and that the majority of Americans have one. They think they are perfectly healthy when they are actually 30 pounds overweight and smoking a pack of cigarettes every day.

We‚Äôre not trying to erase trans people, we‚Äôre trying to teach them that there‚Äôs nothing wrong with the way they‚Äôre born and they don‚Äôt need to change their gender identity or mutilate their own genitals in order to have a sense of belonging in society."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"The only sport I know of that women have a slight advantage in (where the record holders are women) is ultra long distance marathons (ones over 100 miles or so), and even there it‚Äôs only a slight edge. 

Of course it‚Äôs a really small section of people that are crazy enough to try something like that, so if there were a larger sample size, that might not be the case, but I don‚Äôt think it would be, as the ones doing it are already top athletes.

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Never thought of it exactly that way, but, that single sentence perfectly sums up the current state of America."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"They said that after the 2000 election. Then Bush won the popular vote in 2004. Blacks and Latino voters came out in bigger numbers for Republicans in the last 2 elections, showing a very dangerous trend for Democrats.

What changed to make it so Democrats still won? White women swung hard against Trump, hating him. Anti-Trump. 

If the GOP can stabilize those demographics a popular vote is fairly easy for a Republican. Even with mass mail in ballots in California padding the numbers. California Republicans also hated Trump. Polling in 2016 showed that even though Trump had the band wagon effect going, had the California primary still made a difference the state was going to overwhelming vote for Cruz to stop a Trump candidate. My brother in California (big conservative for his entire life) voted Independent in 2016/2020 as he would not vote for Trump."

But in the last 7 years it has sunk to a shell of its formal self and I‚Äôm not sure how or when they can right the ship. Do feel bad for this guy though.

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,For now it's because that's where economic growth is. Eventually more land will be developed.

He apparently hung out with the poor outcasts of society and spoke out against the wealthy, powerful religious types and their hypocrisy and abuse of power.  He was also a powerful advocate of social assistance, healthcare and community service.

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"I predict California housing will get worse before it gets better.  The state needs to collapse more.

One day, when there is reduced enthusiasm, you will eventually get people thinking ""what can I do to get people to move here.""  As long as there's high demand, they just have every incentive not to fix it.  Everyone who buys in there is a newly minted anti-housing advocate.  There's NIMBYism everywhere, but in other places you sometimes get people who think: My property would be *more* valuable if this area was better developed as more people will want to move in.  That has worked for people in eg Nashville.  Nobody in California has thought that for a long time."

*And that‚Äôs always been my vision for our country.
To restore the soul of the nation.*

***To rebuild the backbone of America, the middle class.***

*To unite the country.*

*We‚Äôve been sent here to finish the job.*

*For decades, the middle class was hollowed out.*

*Too many good-paying manufacturing jobs moved overseas.* 

*Factories at home closed down.*

*Once-thriving cities and towns became shadows of what they used to be.*

*And along the way, something else was lost.
Pride. That sense of self-worth.*

*I ran for President to fundamentally change things, to make sure the economy works for everyone so we can all feel pride in what we do.*

*To build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down.* 

*Because when the middle class does well, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy still do very well. We all do well.*"

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"100% correct. They don‚Äôt even care about Trump‚Äôs policies. They like him as a person. Their vote is purely emotional. They‚Äôre much like democrats in that regard. If Trump loses the primary and he told them not to vote for whoever beat him, they wouldn‚Äôt. They don‚Äôt care that policy wise, Desantis or whoever, and Trump, agree on 90% of policy. They don‚Äôt care that democrats overturned just about everything Trump did, from the border to the economy. They would happily hand 2024 to the democrats if Trump lost the primary because their feelings would be hurt, just like Trumps."

If you or I had committed just one of the crimes that he's being accused of? We would be in handcuffs in front of a judge  with a lawyer, and we would have to answer for our crimes.

Do they need to re-write laws about Presidents or ex-Presidents who commit crimes?

CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"If you use the word ‚Äúmutilation‚Äù, then a) i highly doubt you‚Äôre a liberal, and b) i highly doubt you‚Äôre actually a trans ally in any capacity. 

If I‚Äôm incorrect, allow me to educate you a little. For starters, children aren‚Äôt getting any sort of ‚Äúmutilation‚Äù surgeries. They just aren‚Äôt. Regardless of whether that‚Äôs our business, anyway, it‚Äôs a non issue. The most common form of gender affirming care for children is social transitioning, where they do things like change their attire, take on a different name, assume different pronouns, get a different haircut, etc. That‚Äôs generally done before anything else at all. It‚Äôs a good way to test out and ensure they feel as comfortable in that new identity as they think they will.

The second step can be puberty blockers, which the effects, if you stop taking them, are almost always reversible. Normal puberty commences and everything adjusts as it would in any other child. 

In some extreme cases, the next step is hormonal treatment, where they start on the hormone that they want to transition to. However, this is never the first step, and there is always plenty of time to back out and ‚Äúdecide‚Äù if this is right for them. 

So stop using the word ‚Äúmutilation‚Äù‚Ä¶ at all. Those surgeries are legitimate gender affirming care and shouldn‚Äôt be called that in the first place, but additionally, it‚Äôs just not happening to children."

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,This is how it should be. I don't want my taxes going to private schools. I want them to be used on public schools. So many states have public schools that aren't properly funded on purpose as a way to push students into private and charter schools and to create political fodder and push culture war issues that fire up their base.  The cherokee nation in Oklahoma is stepping in to help fund public schools that the state won't. they believe every kid should have the tools to succeed in public school and I agree.
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,There is a need to conserve our history and culture. It‚Äôs possible to progress too far too fast and lose our way. However that‚Äôs not what concerns these people.

At any rate, a guy jumped me for my wallet, nothing fancy moreso typical NYC mugging.  

BUT because I‚Äôm built, honestly, better than the average able bodied person, I beat this man down.  Down bad.  And when I got him on the ground I used the wheelchair as a weapon to stomp on his chest and neck.  

Turns out he was homeless and NYC is responsible for the hospital bills of homeless people (somehow).  

I was charged with excessive self defense as I went above and beyond with no care that my fight or flight instincts kicked in. My goal was to stop him.  He wound up on life support.

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"No, but I'm finding conflicting information.  Can you help me understand this article in regards to Biden and energy independence? 

This article is a huge mess.  The first paragraph has nothing to do with gas prices or the rest of the article.  Then the article claims Biden attacked our energy independence without explaining how, when, or what the impact was.  Then it runs a bit with how this is a benefit to Russia.  Then it suggests that Saudi Arabia is raising prices because of Biden  but fails to make a correlation to how he is involved in this decision.    

The article also links to another article (below)  which only references Biden as an agent who is fighting these rising prices.  I hope you can understand why I'm confused.  I really wish these articles were a little clearer.  If Biden is / has done something which causes gas prices to rise I would like to know what that is so I can have something to talk to my left leaning friends about.

LIBERAL,r/liberal,"1. A belief that society CAN and SHOULD get better on a series of metrics related to individual human lives (in other words we can incrementally increase the QUANTITY and QUALITY of life people experience in terms of making peoples lives generally longer and happier over time) and that good governance has a role to play in achieving this. 

2. As commitment to the principle that individuals and organized groups of individuals are often the best source of information about themselves and that their voices must be heard in the quest to achieve number 1. In other words‚Ä¶ a belief in listening and responding to peoples‚Äô needs (especially those from vulnerable communities).

3. An opposition to the undue amassing of power by any individual, group, or organization over other groups. In practice this means limiting governmental, institutional, or corporate incursion of human and civil rights and also ensuring that individuals are not able to exercise that sort of power over others at the ground level. In other words‚Ä¶ advancing equality and limiting abuse.

4. A belief that DEMOCRACY (though imperfect) is the only moral system of government and that it‚Äôs institutions must be protected against damage, corruption, or negation to maintain the legitimacy of the government.

5. A belief that market economics (though imperfect) is the only system of political economy that most closely aligns with the democratic principles from principles 2 and 4 and the advancement of quality and quantity of life sought in principles 1 and 2 and that it‚Äôs negative externalities CAN and SHOULD be addressed with good policy to ensure it also promotes human rights.

6. A belief that PERSUASION is a necessary component of democracy and market economics and that to abandon that idea means abandoning the very idea of democracy.

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,">Vance won by a large 6% bro he wasn‚Äôt dragged lol. Ohio is a safe R state by now, that race was never in doubt

How did Dewine do? In pretty much every single election the Trump candidate underperformed normal republicans.

>AZ in 2022 had the super trumpy Kari Lake who was awful in many regards lose by only 17,000 votes. Masters got fucked though by a good well funded incumbent. In GA Kemp easily won but the trumpy candidate Herschel Walker who could barely speak only lost by 40k votes or 1% in the main election (runoff was worse). In NV Republicans actually won the governor and lost the senate seat, both very narrowly

All of this happening in the best mid-term environment for the GOP since 1994.  Those loses should have been lay-up victories.  Not close loses.

>Again, I‚Äôm not claiming personally that Trump is the best option or will win all of these states. I‚Äôm just being reasonable enough to understand that narrowly losing states by >1% or tens or thousands of votes doesn‚Äôt mean that the states are lost forever and trump has 0% chance of winning them

They are not lost for forever.  However, we have 3 straight elections of them rejecting Trumpism, and when available accepting/embracing normal Republicans.

>And Republicans for the past like decade or two have a terrible track record in the rust belt usually not even being close except for 2016 and 2020, Trump seems to have some sort of appeal there when he‚Äôs on the ballot that drives out working class rurals.

Bush did pretty good. Trump has also cost the GOP the suburbs which will hurt long term in the growing areas of the country.  Trading for states that are losing population for growing states is not a good long term bet.

>And also again, there‚Äôs a difference between trumpism and trump. In 2022 we saw candidates who were not Trump face all the downsides of him without the upside of juiced rural numbers. The pro-Trump idea is that 2016 and 2020 show that when Trump himself is on the ballot it goes much better than weak midterms in 2018 and 2022

If that is the case, then why did we win the house in 2022 but not 2020?  Election after election since 2016 shows that Trump does more for Democrats than he does for the GOP."

LIBERAL,r/liberal,"Also, let‚Äôs be honest. DeSantis is horrible and fascist, but I think he would be less destructive than Trump. I‚Äôm voting in the GOP primary for the most sane candidate possible but I may even vote for DeSantis (ü§Æ) because 4 more years of Trump would be a catastrophe.

But you know what would be worse? Trump losing another general election. They would riot."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"I mean the article is literally right there

CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,And it seems he is doing just that.
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,This should be the top comment. California isn't throwing in the towel. California is just the first to signal in on the plan
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"One schmuck doesn‚Äôt speak for all of us. This literally is innovating, and banning free trade in any form is bad."
LIBERAL,r/conservative,I think for a lot of politicos on both sides their bread and butter is being outraged and offended. This ain't just a left problem
LIBERAL,r/conservative,Fair enough.
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Yeah, this is very upsetting! Absolutely ridiculous"
LIBERAL,r/liberal,Who on earth sees their lives improved as a result of trump‚Äôs existence? Nobody at all. That‚Äôs who.
LIBERAL,r/conservative,"People keep downvoting you because they are thinking with their emotions, but you are right. Andrew Branca is far from a leftist, and he keeps harping on this point: there is not a single state in the US that allows the use of deadly force to recover stolen property, and no property is worth serving life in prison."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,I hate having to continually convince myself that Trump will face justice one day. Someone fucking deliver some. I have justice blue balls.
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"They agreed to trade with China using their own currencies, not use the yuan as a reserve currency"
LIBERAL,r/conservative,"It is legitimately hilarious that a GOP governor, who is in the gubernatorial line of Bill Clinton, thinks to announce and admonish his competitor not to run. Timed with the recent indictment of that competitor, who is the most-popular candidate.

It's difficult to look like a uniparty clown and a vulture at the same time, but he's managing."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"1. You can still defend yourself with a revolver, you are making a bad faith argument and you know it.
2. People who think AR-15s will protect them against the government are delusional and live in a fantasy land. It will never happen, there's a reason US police have been militarized over the last 20 years. And that's not even counting the military."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"Now while I cannot claim to have changed another of minds pointing out "" no one killed more US servicemen"" and such has absolutely notocably deflated them."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,Surface level kindness and basic human empathy are ‚Äúwoke‚Äù to these chuckleheads.
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"It still will, considering the GOP bill to block it has about the same chance to pass as I have to become the supreme emperor of the universe before bedtime tonight."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,">The emails illustrate just how long some major figures in the anti-trans movement have been incubating political attacks on transgender healthcare.

To hell with these people, targeting the most vulnerable for bullying and attacks."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"It's okay. You tried.

LIBERAL,r/liberal,"Jesus. I‚Äôm sorry you have to endure that! I actually live in CA, but I work in NV because I live so close to the state border. Lombardo is not as bad as Desantis or Abbott, but he has let us know he‚Äôs here to obstruct government as much as possible. He also issued an order requiring all state employees to end remote work by 7/1."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Not Christian, but family values are something that all religions support and so should all people whether religious or not. Chris Pratt is probably my favorite actor for not bending over backwards to the woke Hollywood mob."

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,That is not why he may go to jail.
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Eh, this bill aside, banning tik tok while still good really only opens the door to Instagram and YouTube swallowing up that market share with a fraction of a percent chance musk goes for some of it with vine (Twitter owns vine)"
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,Yes let people become even more lazy and make it okay. Please
LIBERAL,r/liberal,This harpie is still wailing about imaginary BS ?
LIBERAL,r/liberal,Why is all the vitriol necessary? Why can't people mind their own business? Live and let live? Why does this have to be a political issue at all?
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,I'm so sick of this hideous slob...
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,So the New York Times picks on kids for the way they were brought up. That's how scumbags defend themselves.
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"It's so great to know.

So many other people believe otherwise.

Sadly."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Where can I learn more about this Soros connection? A legit source if anyone has one, please and thanks."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"People just don't seem to realize how dangerous this moment in history was. Had the insurrection been a little bit bigger and more organized, we could have ended up with a whole bunch of dead congresspeople and their staffers. It was an attack on Democracy itself, and it was orchestrated by Donald Dump and the Republican party."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,He hit a nerve when he asked Bernie to be honest. That is absolutely not standard operating proceedure for Liberals.

CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,That graphic is perfect for this story!
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,Well well well if it isn't the consequences of my own actions...
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"As someone with ADHD, I see what she‚Äôs trying to say here. It is extremely frustrating trying to compete in a world where you have the most basic tasks working against you. I would not wish ADHD upon anyone. Time blindness especially is a big one.

That being said, the responsibility is still on ME to live my best life and make the best decisions that I can. I can‚Äôt expect the rest of the world to cater to me and how my brain works. Absolutely you can come across people who understand you and get how you work‚Ä¶but sometimes you won‚Äôt. And that‚Äôs ok. It‚Äôs on YOU to navigate these challenges and become the best version of yourself that you can be.

I am an awesome leader in the work place. I make a great manager, I‚Äôm competent and the people below me respect me. But I am terrible at following other peoples directions‚Ä¶things just don‚Äôt stick when people tell me things. I forget what they said or I‚Äôll only hear parts of it. I‚Äôve been told all my life that I have ‚Äúno common sense‚Äù or I‚Äôm an idiot or whatever the case may be. I know these things aren‚Äôt true, and I do wish more people understood ADHD and how we are kind of all over the place and sometimes we have serious brain fog that we can‚Äôt seem to shake, but it doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre dumb or that we lack leadership skills or intellect. Everyone loves me as a manager because I have my own system and I get the job done. My whole life I‚Äôve been like ‚Äúif people would just give me a chance I can prove to them that I can do the job‚Äù, and then I get into a leadership position and everybody is eating their words. I really just can‚Äôt follow other peoples systems, I have a very hard time with that. As a leader, any time I‚Äôm training someone I get a feel for how they work and I keep open communication with them to see what aspects of the job suit them better or worse than others. It‚Äôs all about looking at the positives of each individual and seeing what they offer the team and working with that. If someone has a particular system or way of working that suits them better, then I let them do their thing, because that‚Äôs how they work best. For the most part I let them play to their strengths, but I do challenge them sometimes to put them outside their comfort zone a little.

So yeah, like I said, I get what she‚Äôs saying, I do admit that life really isn‚Äôt very fair to people with ADHD. We don‚Äôt even have the benefit of having a condition that people take seriously, so we just get called lazy, but at the end of the day, you are dealt the cards that you are dealt and you gotta do the best you can in life. You can‚Äôt adopt the mentality of ‚Äúeveryone must cater to me‚Äù, because then you lose at everything."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Yeah it's weird to see conservatives say things like ""we"" need to support Ukraine.  Haven't figured it out yet?  To the Biden regime and the globalists there is no ""we.""  They view us no differently than the Russians.

Who do you think they're going to target once they have achieved total world domination?  Us."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"Again, bothsidesism and whataboutism are what Cons do to deflect and minimize the bat shit craziness on their side"
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"Hey guys, come on. He liked beer. He still likes drinking beer. I'm sure that he didn't drink enough beer to the point of blacking out, and I'm sure he only sexually assaulted maybe one person in that time."

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,Stop spreading harmful misinformation.
LIBERAL,r/conservative,"I suggest checking out the history of the House of Habsburg. And also the disdain they've always shown. Nothing about this is new. It's literally been worse, they're just repeating it while we have internet to know about it instantly."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"> They knew what Santos was and they liked it.

Most voters had no idea about his extensive lies because how could they have possibly known when nobody was talking about it? Even the local Republicans didn't know how extensive his lies were because now they're calling for him to resign."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,They want to kill poor people.
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,Terrorism is cool when Democrats do it.
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,Yeah. The end goal is effectively a stateless society where everyone works for the betterment of everyone. Which is a laughable fantasy because the massive state formed as the prerequisite to setting the ground for the end goal will NEVER give up that power.
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"A People‚Äôs History of the United States, by Howard Zinn"

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Maybe, but not in the context of this article or the specific episode that the article is ‚Äúreporting‚Äù on.

I‚Äôm just pointing out that Sears wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúdunking‚Äù on Maher and his other guest as the article suggests."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Trump has a lot of fight in him. Wish we didn‚Äôt have to resort doing it.  Whether he talks and goes to jail or he is exonerated, this country is majorly fcuked beyond repair. The cancer has metastasized and it‚Äôll be a matter of time before it‚Äôll be over. The left ruined everything."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"MAGA should announce a day of vengeance, but not actually carry through with it, just to show the difference in media reaction side by side."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"It's bad in both cases, but the details and how they handled it are what makes it different."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,Garfield was a minister for an organization called the Disciples of Christ. It's a little more complicated than that. But he did a lot of lobbying for them. It's actually a really interesting dive.
LIBERAL,r/liberal,Because they think being a criminal and a disgusting human being are actually traits to strive for and considered leadership quality.
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,Biden is everything they accused Trump of being.
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,">""He is guilty of everything....""

CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,Teddy Roosevelt
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"At this point they're so deep into the shit that they can't leave. Few of the other mainstream media outlets will touch them so they have to stay within the conservative media ecosystem, even if it means going independent."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"We need to be able to recognize the type of rhetoric that leads to this. I'm betting dollars to donuts that the ""trans genocide"" rhetoric is all over this shooting."

CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"Either they mean the next speaker would have to live with the concessions *in order to get voted in* by the same crazies, or they're wrong. At the start of each term they can redraw the rules so if say the Democrats win next time, they can just get rid of them again."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"I'm torn. For one, I'm lukewarm on ketchup. (I'm convinced fries, much like popcorn, exist to increase my salt intake.) Of course I wouldn't have to eat it in this scenario, but I'd be the person scraping it off the walls, and to top things off, I'm pretty sure the color clashes with my decor..."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,The problem in politics for doing something in exchange for something else is there's absolutely no way to police it. He could agree to it and then after he's elected speaker not agree to it. I'm sure there's a process to pluck him out though. Like a vote of no confidence or something.
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,I blame the biden installation

The primary season hasn't even started yet. Only people trying to make names for themselves start campaigning this early (Trump being the exception to this rule). These type of arguments of ""running out of time"" are non-sense as in 2016 Scott Walker was the obvious leading candidate at this point in the election cycle. This will not get serious until the summer."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"No one's trying to stop anyone from anything that I can see. If a previously accepted point of view or behavior is now out of fashion and worthy of disavowel, the person has a choice to make. Reform the behavior or suffer a drop in popularity.  
The recent case of Scott Adams is not a case of 'cancel culture'. Mr. Adam's cracked wise on a survey derived from a 4chan meme (""It's Okay to be White"") and blew up his existing contracts. It is still TBD to know if he meant to kill his income stream or did it inadvertently.

The Right's blaming of ""cancel culture"" and ""woke"" social movements is disingenuous. I'll take woke over based on lies, misinformation and newspeak which is most passes for conservative rhetoric."

LIBERAL,r/liberal,"I think that they should be target more for fraudulent gain e.g. when someone tosses in that old email are being evaluated then if it can be proven that there is no other reason for this other than political gain, then that action should be treated as one would with a similar set of actions when share trading.

Relevant people are taking ""slander"" action with voting machines and I hope they win with that. What happened with Alex Jones is also a good step in the right direction but ""Slander"" is a difficult concept to work with. That doesn't mean that it should be utilised but there are a range of negative concepts e.g. slander, fraud, etc. that should be used in a legal setting.

The last thing to remember is that it is a core axiom for the GOP and their supporters that they don't care about whether what they believe and tell others is true or not. While this does fit with ""Slander"", legally it is difficult to apply in a meaningful manner that produces tangible results."

Private schools treat their students better from what I've seen, religious or not.. 
But that's ofc not what Republicans care about, as I've been belittled for being 'too young' by them, however caring about what young adults need or want is very unfocused upon by almost everyone.. 

:/ A lot of radical Republicans, I can agree think religion should be taught in schools.. but we'll never ever get to that point, that would be unconstitutional (first amendment) 

Many, like Marjorie Taylor Greene definitely want that, but as far as the majority of the GOP, Kelly Armstrong, Don Bacon ü•ì, Anthony Gonzalez, and '_' maybe Trump himself definitely don't seem like the type..

Trump doesn't understand much things, so I don't see him being able to really have an opinion, if his republican colleagues told him how to think, then he'd definitely feel like getting rid of the DE.."

1. What about self-defense outside of a home? The most common self-defense firearm for women is a handgun. Other guns are too large and revolvers are a bad choice for self-defense for many reasons. How do we justify not allowing women to defend themselves?
2. The point of the 2nd amendment was protection against the government.  No one really argues this isn't important after what we have seen in places like venezula where firearms were taken and then mass genocide took place. It is easy to prove that an armed citizen base can stand up to a government. Large firing tanks/missiles/high collateral damage weapons would never be used against civilians as it defeats the purpose since the government is essentially destroying itself by doing this. In a revolt you see the government use primarily ground based firearm led combat which is very difficult against a large armed civilian population (look at Russia in major Ukrainian cities where soldiers have stated they cannot advance because they don't know who will shoot them). So how do we justify disarming civilians against the government?"

CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"I was so shocked when I read this article. I actually had to read it twice.

It's quite unbelievable that the legislature in Iowa (Republican majority) wants to try to get a waiver from the USDA to make sure people on food stamps can't purchase real food - like fresh meat.

>*A proposed bill could prevent Iowans who use the former Food Stamp Program from purchasing various pantry staples.*

The legislature wants to control the types of food they are allowed to purchase and prepare for their families.

>*A new bill introduced by Iowa House Republicans last week could drastically cut the types of food that people in the state can buy using Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits.*

They want to restrict food stamp recipients so that they can only purchase foods that families who are on the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Nutrition Program are allowed to purchase.

>*To safeguard the health of low-income women, infants, and children up to age 5 who are at nutrition risk by providing nutritious foods to supplement diets, information on healthy eating, and referrals to health care.*

Does anyone know why WIC was established? Do they care? 

It was specifically geared towards pregnant women and their children who, it was decided, need a certain type of food to nurture their bodies and their babies through important development stages in their lives. 

>*The proposed waiver would restrict SNAP purchases to items that appear on the state‚Äôs approved food list for a different federal initiative, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children. Also known as WIC, the program provides food assistance for pregnant people, new mothers and young children, and it is significantly more limited than SNAP. ""Iowans on SNAP would not be able to buy meat, flour, butter, cooking oil, frozen prepared foods,‚Äù Luke Elzinga, the chair of the nonprofit Iowa Hunger Coalition, told Iowa‚Äôs News Now. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a huge list.‚Äù In lieu of fresh meat, canned salmon and tuna would be allowed, according to a list of Iowa‚Äôs approved WIC foods. In addition to pantry staples like flour and oil, other prohibited items would include canned soup and sliced cheese. Only brown, and not white, rice would be permitted, and shoppers would have to swap white bread and pasta for 100% whole-grain versions.*

SNAP is totally different. It's for the entire family. They want to ban:

‚ñ† all fresh meat (and replace it with canned salmon and tuna only)

‚ñ† white rice (and replace it with brown rice)

‚ñ† flour

‚ñ† butter

‚ñ† cooking oil

‚ñ† frozen prepared food

‚ñ† sliced cheese

‚ñ† canned soup

‚ñ† regular pasta (and replace it with wheat pasta)

And what about people who can't eat the food listed above because of dietary restrictions?

And why no fresh meat?

Strange.

>*In addition to limiting eligible foods, the bill would also impose multiple restrictions making it more difficult for people to qualify for SNAP in the first place.*

And why make it harder to qualify for food stamps? 

Many people are on food stamps actually have jobs. Yet they don't make enough money to support their families and buy food. So the government gives them food stamps. 

Now, they want to add more restrictions to the ridiculous restrictions that already exist? So that people who really need food stamps will no longer qualify.

If you are poor? You can't save money or try to get out of your poverty status because the government is saying that you can't have any attributes of trying to improve your life.

My neighbor and his wife receive $ 517.00 per month for EBT / food stamps due to the pandemic. All food stamp recipients received additional food stamps due to the pandemic.

They just received a letter stating their EBT benefits will be reduced to $ 23.00 per month (after the pandemic EBT goes away), after  February 2023. They are on disability and they received an 8.9 % increase. 

The 8.9 % increase in no way, shape or form, makes up for the food benefits they are losing. Or the higher costs for goods and services they currently pay.

They are not the only ones.

It's very difficult for everyone.

Food Banks are closing, or not staying open as long.

People and corporate entities are not donating as much.

Shelves are empty.

Also? 

I think one of the worst things you can do is drastically decrease the pandemic level food stamp coverage so many Americans rely on.

And why are the Republicans supporting this proposed legislation to keep Americans and their families from real food? Including spices?

Do they think Americans, especially the disabled and elderly, deserve to be hungry?

It's not like the disabled and ederly can go get a job tomorrow to make up for all of the money that is being taken away from them through this proposed legislation.

Just? 

Why?

LIBERAL,r/liberal,"""Convincing"" you to switch sides isn't really how it works. Being on the left is about having morals regardless of any religious views. They can be separate, you don't need one to get the other. But, here are some of my views:

Learn that anything that goes against a narrow mindset is not something that should be instantly demonized.

Learn and teach history as it happened and not through rose-colored glasses. Don't be afraid to learn that your ancestors might have done bad things.

The job of a politician is not to obstruct the opposing party to the detriment of your constituents.

EDIT: Just found one instance that might convince someone. The Wyoming State Legislature has a bill going through that puts a minimum age of 16 on child marriage. Right now a child can get married at any age in Wyoming. The State GOP is outraged over the possibility of limiting religious liberty. While only 3% of child marriages involve a child younger than 16. If that isn't a common sense reason to switch sides, I don't know what is."

Mitt Romney, who notably refused to indorse Lee‚Äôs re-election campaign. Sexual imagery, ironically, gets magic Mormon underpants in a bunch not so much because polygamy has been forced underground (retched bucket of cold water), but because enlightenment is reserved for those (males) burying their engorged faces into a sacred hat, all the better to receive the taint of sweat and messages for the saints. Even to the casual observer, it is sadly obvious Lee has outgrown his collar size several times over, thus drastically reducing blood flow to the mass between his conspicuous ears, shorting vital circuits necessary for higher thought.

https://youtu.be/tCuIxIJBfCY

I think guns are fine, I personally love guns and would love to open carry. I definitely don‚Äôt think we should be allowed to open carry though.

The problem I and a lot of people actually have with guns is gun registration. For example a 13 year old buys a gun, who gets held as responsible? Only the 13 year old. 
Guns need to have a serial number, chip or some identifiers ideally on each part that can‚Äôt be removed so that someone could be held responsible if it ends up in the wrong hands. That‚Äôs all I really want.
For example Mexico has a major gun problem, well Mexico only has one gun store in the entire country. All their guns come from the USA illegally, and no one ever gets held responsible when those weapons are found used by criminals.

Also common sense is that more guns will equal more deaths and shootings, because verbal or physical altercations quickly lead to guns getting pulled and gets deadly when it would‚Äôve otherwise been a non lethal altercation. There are obviously countless examples of this and it‚Äôs common sense"

LIBERAL,r/conservative,"> think this is actually where my distaste with politics begins. I believe that the only productive thing political parties and factions do is divide people

Which is what George Washington thought, which is why he was against political parties.

The issues is in a system such as ours, it's a necessary means in implementing change. You need to build a coalition to promote the cause/agenda you wish to see implemented. Organized political causes are much more successful than spontaneous political causes.

Conservatives do view politics/political parties as a necessary evil. Similar to guns, war, and the death penalty. These are not binary issues. Do we wish they didn't need to exist? For the most part. But the alternative is much, much worse.

>so I don't even want to play the game to begin with

No one wants to play the game. Well the left does seem to treat politics like a religion, so many on the left might want to. This is like saying, ""Hey I don't want to have to work a job and feed myself."" Well, it's no fun and you wish you didn't have to. But it's kind of a fact of reality whether or not you want to or like it.

A Stoic Principle (going back to Ancient Greece and later Rome) is that you have little control over what goes on in the world (as you are only a single person), but you do have control over how you react to it.

>I will vote but what I care more about than the letter next to their name is the candidates' quality of character and their values.

You will never know their quality of character. Only what you think their quality of character is. The only thing you know for certain is how they present themselves or what values they champion. Politicians are professional liars, especially when it comes to dressing up themselves. The vast majority of them are lawyers, they are not an actual sampling of the average American. Law Students spent their time in college not learning law (that's what cramming for the bar exam is for), but learning how to manipulate people towards a conclusion you want them to have.

To put simply, we would all want trustworthy and high quality candidates. The problem is the people willing to become politicians and go through all that nastiness are unlikely to be of good of character as you would hope for.

>I'm not sure if that's entirely true. While on some issues I am certainly more left or right leaning, I have yet to come across an issue that I entirely agree with one side on. There are also some issues that I am also pretty neutral about, or am simply not educated enough on the subject to hold a position.

This is typically because you haven't done enough research to understand the two sides. Surface level reads of subject might lead you to believe that. Also note that the ""sides"" hold a spectrum of beliefs and aren't just holding the Party Line.

So for instance Abortion. Pro-life hold a whole bunch of positions that do account for exceptions for abortion. You wouldn't know that based on how the media portray it. Gallup yearly polling has a break down of actual implementation of law and how Americans support it.

- No restrictions on abortion at all.
- Few restrictions on abortion (late term abortions type restrictions only).
- Few exceptions for abortion (rape, serious birth defects, incest)
- No abortion (though this is nearly unanimous that if the life of the mother is truly in danger, they will allow that exception. But this is actually not common at all).

There is your ""spectrum"" of positions. Pro-life Includes the bottom two, and pro-choice includes the top two. As people in the ""few exceptions"" category found the Roe v. Wade status quo to be abhorrent as well.

Being apolitical is a neutral term, but it's also one that hasn't bothered to invest in the issue (doing the time, research, and evaluation of it). Most Americans are apolitical on a whole host of issues. The problem with being apolitical is that it means you are easier to manipulate on the issue."

That bakery did not refuse any LGBT person who came in to buy their general baked goods, only custom creations for same-sex weddings.

If thus was done by Trump I know all my friends would agree with me.

* Because you may not know the specifics if you didn't watch the hearing, I will provide you the context of the money given to Twitter. Government offered money to Twitter for their time to censor speech. Twitter initially denied the money because they knew, ""the money is a conflict of interest"". Those are Twitter's words.

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Visitor here, have lived in Manhattan for 10 years now, trying to get some perspective, let me lend just a bit of context given i am close with a number of NYC ADAs. 

This incident occurred at 5:30am Saturday. Outside of normal working hours, ADAs work in something called the complaint room, where the police bring in suspects, police report and suggested charges and the ADAs ‚Äúwrite them up‚Äù, or make a decision on charges based on available evidence. 

This garage attendant couldn‚Äôt have been indicted yet because grand juries don‚Äôt work on the weekend. My guess is NYPD brought both in having written up attempted murder on both, ADA agreed on initial pass of available evidence (which 
 would likely only be witness accounts / hospital reports because there‚Äôs no way they get security video that quickly).

Do I agree with the outcome as it currently stands? Of course not, but I do think that cooler heads will prevail once people get a chance to sort through. On the other hand, I think that certain news outlets are jumping over a yet-incomplete situation to drive clicks."

I guarantee they will run the same playbook smear campaign they did against Trump (and Kavanaugh) against whoever the GOP nominee is.

Thus, during the period of suspension, no interest will accrue on outstanding loans so that borrowers are in the same position as they were before the suspension period began.

How do you keep the system from being gamed?

How can this be enforced?  What safeguards are there to prevent abuse?

CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"That's a rather pedantic take, considering the rhetoric is basically calling to ban trans people from going out in public. He's saying that the idea of being trans is preposterous & that presenting oneself as trans should be forbidden in public. If they enshrine that into law, trans people would either have to stay in the closet or risk legal ramifications anytime they go out. Forcing trans people into the closet will absolutely, with 100% certainty, increase the rate of suicide among trans people. I'm not being hyperbolic when I say he's calling for the genocide of trans people."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"It's not the media, it's the people. Trump gives the media ammo in the form of crass comments, mean tweets, and  ill-advised off the cuff remarks. The media reports it with spin, then people hear it and hate Trump on an emotional level. I do not think DeSantis will make the same mistakes. While the media does try to spin DeSantis in the way they do with Trump, it will be (and so far is) less effective. The media did the same with previous republican candidates, but no one has driven out the hate vote more than Trump."

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"> DeSantis is taking heat over past votes

*As well he should.* His career as a politician should be a total reflection on how he would perform in office and what policies he would push for. He hasn't had to deal with any flak in his current Governor position from Republicans because the Legislature there has given him softball Conservative bills that all he had to do was sign. It wouldn't be the same if he were President with a hostile Congress in D.C. DeSantis would either sidle up to the Establishment to get things accomplished so that he can appear successful, he would be weak and simply be a lame duck in the role like Biden is today, or he would push for Executive Orders that would serve the public.

We definitely don't want the first two options. And we already have the third in President Trump who I believe would handle the job much better because he knows what to expect and how the system works there already.

I have always been skeptical about DeSantis and his true motives long before Trump started talking about him. I would be more apt to look at DeSantis and consider voting for him if we didn't have Trump who is still eligible to be back in the White House. But as long as Trump is a possibility, then he is the only candidate that I will consider voting for because of his successes that he had when he was in there before, even with the Uniparty's dislike/hatred of him."

LIBERAL,r/liberal,"Depends on your definition of liberal. Liberal as in mainstream Democrat, sure, they obviously don‚Äôt want to usher in significant change. Myself, I lean more toward the ‚Äúradical‚Äù leftist ideology that allows for strong social welfare programs and the dismantling of our corrupt and failing system in favor of something more akin to a parliamentary democracy.

Only seems fair/justified at this point. I dont think its a political problem but a class problem. Yes republicans the are try hards tho."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"> Are they though? Biden himself hasn‚Äôt done anything that would be considered illegal.

You're missing the point. I'm sure there's some obscure state or federal felony he has committed. Give GOP prosecutors enough time and they can whip something up.

This is the danger of what Democrats are doing to Trump- their desire to get him at all costs is going to force the GOP to retaliate. While the GOP doesn't have control over DC nor Delaware where they have the easiest time prosecuting Democrats, there are certainly a lot of Democratic congresscritters in red states that would be on the receiving end of lawfare."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"They do want their kid to go somewhere secure. A security guard says ""not secure"" to them. A security guard says ""bad enough shit has happened here before"". It's a psychological thing. And let's face it, police and security guards don't have a great reputation in many places in the U.S. right now, either. School shootings have also occurred despite security guards being present.

While it's possible they would make schools more secure overall, the optics make the politics an obstacle. That's why it hasn't been done(on a broader scale). If it gets done successfully at a school that could help, but the problem is success is pretty much invisible until a security guard happens to stop a potential school shooter."

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"The Left is doing a great job getting trump nominated and then having him lose to Biden in the general. There will likely be a few more indictments coming out which will further tarnish him and make him damaged goods to independents/moderate voters.

CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"Republicans know the conservative mind is highly motivated by fear and anxiety, so there is a constant marketing campaign on the right to invent new labels to put on their liberal competition such as ""woke"". What I find interesting is the right having to define ""woke"" during the recent lawsuit against DeSantis...

""Asked what ‚Äúwoke‚Äù means more generally, \[Desantis‚Äô General Counsel Ryan\] Newman said ‚Äúit would be the belief there are systemic injustices in American society and the need to address them.‚Äù

LIBERAL,r/liberal,"What's funny is even not knowing your reasons, it still is probably related.

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative," The 1st amendment right of a candidate, political speech, and a political party - the highest value speech that exists in the US.

Then the boss won't be able to use that document for whatever he needed it for. Say, he needs to proofread it before sending it up the chain of command.

As more affluent (traditionally white) people switch from public to private school, there is less money available for those who remain in public education. So, poor people and people of color who can't get in to private school get a substandard education compared to the private schools - both funded (at least partially) by taxpayer money. If parents want to put their kids in private school, that's fine, but tax dollars shouldn't be taken away from public school systems because of it. 
To be clear, Republics don't want reliving taught in school. They want Christianity taught in schools. Satanic Temple is using the Republican backed ""freedom of religion"" laws to force systems that allow Christian after school clubs to also allow satanic temple school clubs. You can't have freedom of religion and then exclude religions you don't like. Many schools have closed their Christian after school programs rather than allow satanic temple programs to participate. His that for freedom of religion? It's the same way white communities shut down public pools and filled them with dirt rather than integrate and allow black students in.
The is very mainstream Republican, but just the fringe group you describe. 
As for Trump, he get behind whatever issue he thinks will get him the most money and power. As for education, why do you think he made De Vos the Education Secretary? She had no relevant experience and no relevant education. She was a strong proponent of school vouchers and he knew she'd work to dismantle the Education dept. He and his buddies would get richer off running private schools. Follow the money, always."

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"I‚Äôve got over 20years in SigInt, take that for what it‚Äôs worth. LEO and GEO sats aren‚Äôt on station long enough to provide the coverage mapping of a balloon doing figure 8‚Äôs over a specific target at balloon speed. The US does TONS of ground based collections because as collection goes, the closer you are to the xmit source the more complete you collection is going to be, ‚Äúheight makes might‚Äù in transmitting, it‚Äôs nearly the opposite for collection. Cryptography can be cracked, and not every comms device used by government, contractors or military is encrypted, especially the mundane day to day work. 

Never mind that the US tracked the balloon since it‚Äôs departure from Hainan and had the entire Pacific Ocean to prepare for a take down once it entered US airspace, offshore west coast. You know why I don‚Äôt trust the military? Because I‚Äôve served in it, seen some of the people that are retained and promoted within it (particularly officers), and watched them lie for decades. They also admitted, their goal was less about ‚Äúsafety‚Äù and moreso counterintel (the ability to recover more of the platform intact). We can certainly disagree about the value of whether that was the right call, I maintain it was not given they knew what it was not (a weather balloon) very early in its flight and not knowing it‚Äôs payload or capabilities, allowed it to traverse the continent AND broadcast its intelligence back to Beijing. That‚Äôs poor NatSec by every definition."

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"I'm with you. I have no problem with a *""warning, what you're about to see contains graphic content and may be disturbing to some viewers""* as a heads up.

Combat vets have very real PTSD, and they may want to just step out for some fresh air if a modern history class is going to show war footage. The footage can be good to educate, but the combat vet with PTSD already has that part of the education.

If it's some sort of healthcare class, and the topic of the day is discussing rape, someone whose been brutally raped or suffered sexual abuse as a child might appreciate stepping out for that part of the class with a little heads up. 

Over the top trigger warnings for any little thing are obviously problematic, but for those who have suffered awful experiences in their past, a courteous heads up shouldn't be a controversial thing."

Without a constitutional right or federal law, the states have the right to restrict access to this pill, regardless of fda approval. 

The federal government is allowed to dangle money to the states in exchange for the states doing what the feds want (like when they wanted the states to raise the drinking age to 21), but they cannot force the states to do thing unless there‚Äôs a federal law or constitutional right.

If he can make deadlines and pull his weight, these people can too. Stop catering to this bullshit in the name of DEI."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"I read an article today comparing DeSantis to Jesse Helms from the early 80s. Showing that like Helms, DeSantis is unlikely to get the nomination because of how extreme he is. Helms for instance, was also discriminatory against LGBTQ people, such as trying to get gay people barred from becoming school teachers. Obviously the label LGBTQ didn't exist yet but hatred for them was just as strong. 

The country as a whole is much more accepting than it was back in the 80s. If Helms couldn't get a foot hold, maybe there is hope that DeSantis won't be able to either."

CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"I‚Äôm not sure how any reasonable person cannot understand exactly what she meant without putting almost any effort into thinking about it. As a liberal, I‚Äôm not a leftist, and I‚Äôm definitely not a right wing nut job, but it‚Äôs *extremely* obvious to me that there are insane, insufferable people on both sides. 

The right is much more toxic and insane. We all know that. But the left has people insane enough to believe that it‚Äôs acceptable for biological males to compete against biological females in organized athletics, despite the fact that biological females do not want this and that most people recognize it as absurdly unfair. Any reasonable person knows this without giving it much thought, yet there are leftists who will outrageously and idiotically accuse you of being transphobic or hateful if you write this fact in a public online space such as Reddit.

You also have catch-phrases like ‚Äúall cops are bad‚Äù that don‚Äôt do the left any favors. I‚Äôm not sure how closed-minded one has to be not to recognize the toxicity on both sides, but it definitely disturbs me when I see people *who aren‚Äôt right wing nut jobs* failing to grasp this basic truth.

It‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ some people are afraid to admit that there are insane, toxic people who are ruining society on both sides, as if that will lead to a false equivalency. No. Don‚Äôt worry about that. Everybody knows that the right is the side of absolute batshit insanity and stupidity and overwhelming hatred. But to pretend that the left doesn‚Äôt have some really psychotic shit going on at the same time‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs just ridiculous.

*takes breath*

All that said, blurting out ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù is still a stupid thing to say, and it‚Äôs most often (but not always) misleading when someone says it.

My point is that it‚Äôs a very dangerous blind spot not to notice that the left has some really stupid people on it."

Thats not the comparison being made.  The idea that just because the federal troops are ""Americans"" does not mean that somehow prevents them from enforcing totalitarian laws on other Americans.  We are not where China was in the 80s at this point, but we are certain numbers of steps towards getting there.  DC being in charge of local law enforcement certainly pushes us in that direction.  Germany in 1925-1930 was not ready to genocide undesirables either.

In that regard, it is almost perfectly effective and the reason people needed to wear masks, but all you heard was that they didnt do any good for protection of the wearer. 

The protection of free speech in this country to prevent the GOVERNMENT from suppressing people from uttering their beliefs and opinions. It has little to nothing to do with protecting a private citizen or organization from committing libel or slander against another.

Beauty pageants are simply not drag shows. Idk what more there is to say on that.  

I'm not saying it's a ""societal good,""  and I would push back against that claim, but as far as a performance goes, America should lean towards the freedom of expression here.  The only reason there is liberal defenses of it is because of the hyperbole by conservatives about ""grooming.""  

I was involved in a drag story hour in my city where conservative activists came from out of state to protest it outside of our library.  I think some amount of defense against that is warranted if we are to be consistent and defend expression even when we don't like it."

I would also say that if you are in the sort of state that is in danger of adopting regressive policies about gender, especially with the support of your parents, moving may be an option.

1. Fuck something up
2. Wait for it to crash

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,">He‚Äôs not a victim. He‚Äôs a shark.

Most people who are narcissists operate in conspiracy theories.  Everything is a scam.  Everything is an angle.  There are no honest people only people scamming other scammers.  Narcissism is about threat detection.  If a person disagrees with a narcissist, the narc immediately goes into hypervigilance about seeing how they might be attacked or diminished, and they immediately respond with attacks to delegitimize the other party -- like calling Hogg a ""shark"".

If you have no respect for other people's views and can't meet an opposing person on the merits of their facts, evidence, and reasoned opinions, then maybe it isn't that your arguments and views are wrong.  It's that you can't accept that people have motives that aren't the same as a scam or an ulterior motive.  A narcissist can't argue the facts/viewpoints, so as a defense mechanism to defend their ego, they just assassinate the messenger.

A person who lives through a 35 person assault and massacre is entitled to grieve on their terms and respond to a tragedy on their terms, \*not yours\*.

He's entitled to his viewpoints.  If you can't disagree with another person on the merits, the problem is you, not him and it has nothing to do with guns or the 2nd amendment.  It's that you can't accept someone has a different viewpoint.  And that's what some people might call cancel culture."

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Absolutely. Schools are a parental delegation. The schools should reflect the values and lessons the parents want. No school can have all books, and we all agree that some are inappropriate.

It was a move that incensed Democrats on the panel.

> ‚ÄúThese witnesses are being dismissed without the ability to cross examine their statements, they‚Äôve made some outlandish allegations here,‚Äù Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) said to Jordan. ‚ÄúConsistent with the work of, especially this select committee, and congressional hearings in general, we should have the ability to question their statements.‚Äù

Standard rightwing tomfoolery.  It‚Äôs a kangaroo court where witnesses lie on the stand and are allowed to leave without cross examination.  The head of the committee then instigates a fight with those who have an expectation of fairness or justice."

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Here is how this plays out: The obvious/expedient answer is to convert the space into housing, but that would require cutting regulation which will be a challenge. If converted into housing, property values would decrease from the increase in supply paired with the massive layoffs hitting the city. Businesses no longer bound to office space leave the state and all of that housing ends up used by remote workers in the tech industry. Without SFs insane business tax revenue, state income/property taxes would skyrocket to offset the difference. Remote workers would be priced out and opt to move to a lower COL area.

If we have more adaptations to a given food, that increases the likelihood that one or more of those adaptations has this trade-off. Novel foods haven't been adapted to beyond the nutrients they are composed of. So, if an ancestral food and novel food had the same nutrients and had not been studied for long-term health outcomes, I'd wager on the novel food having better long-term health outcomes on average."

There are exactly zero universally loved people. There is not a historical figure who didn't wrong other people or have some kind of character flaws or do something bad. This attitude would mean we should have no statues or memorials or anything to anyone. Should we destroy our war memorials in DC because some of those soldiers whose names appear there were bad?

In the recent midterms, Democrats decided to put money into the most extreme candidates in the Republican primaries because they felt that an extremist would be easier to beat than a moderate. Pundits at the time warned that this was a risky strategy, but it paid off handsomely. Every single extremist candidate that they backed in the primaries went on to lose in the general election.

Limits on the number of guns any individual can possess at one time. Repeal NRA-written laws that encourage violence. And so on. At the same time, police need to be demilitarized and have their military surplus taken back. All aspects of gun-nuttery need to be pulled back, including within law enforcement.

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"The highest gdp are bluest states I think tho with the largest population.

People won't stay somewhere that tramples on their rights or at least will go somewhere with better rights which is mostly what blue states have to offer including for free medical care coverage. 

 balkanization of the US would be terrible for many states including Hawaii, Rhode Island, or territories like Guam and Puerto Rico, too, because they're heavily dependent on aid from the federal gov. 

The collapse of the federal gov would be bad for everyone. It's not likely we'll lose our super power status as long as it doesn't collapse, either. Because of the massive and powerful military.

First, your GI tract can rupture, leading to massive hemorrhaging. The placenta plays a huge role, and if it becomes adhered to any of the other organs it‚Äôs life threatening. Normally a uterus expels the placenta; if left in the body it can lead to sepsis; and if you remove it when it‚Äôs adhered to other organs it normally causes severe blood loss. If attached to the intestines it can also cause bowel blockage. 

Babies of ectopic pregnancies are often deformed due to a lack of the uterine walls & being compressed in ways it should not be by the other organs. 

More than just implantation is necessary. You also need just the right balance of estrogen & progesterone to carry a pregnancy to term. 

There‚Äôs a reason those with XY chromosomes are not designed to have babies."

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,He must of voted for Trump‚Ä¶
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,Taking notes from CBS
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"I'm not judging, but genuinely curious, about the context of a 35 year old having a roommate, and one they disagree with politically. Sounds like a TV show"
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"It is not always a bad thing to have diversity/inclusive quotas for education and employment.

For example, in education, when students are only ever in classes with people like themselves, they tend not to become familiar with people in other groups. This can lead to racism and bigotry. As well as just a general lack of respect for other subcultures. People from other groups also sometimes bring different opinions which help to create a better environments to foster critical thinking.

Same with employment. Employers can often benefit from having a diversity of ideas, which can often come from a diversity of people.

That being said, affirmative action type policies tend to create hostility and resentment. Because lack of socioeconomic opportunity is often the cause as to why some groups are underrepresented, we could shift to affirmative action based on socioeconomic status. And so more politically savvy, and it would also be inclusive of people who needed more opportunity who are in majority groups."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,Who should we specifically give backlash to?
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Eyes wide open, kudos. I know this will be unpopular with my conservative brethren, but they are two sides of the same coin when it comes to vitriolic politics.

  I have voted republican since I was 18. If you are from Texas this will tell you how long ago that was. Anne Richards (D) and Clayton Williams (R) were the candidates. I voted for Clayton Williams, he lost by unfortunately."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"I work in VA, live in NC and yet another scary thing is other Republicans are emboldened by this nonsense. Youngkin in VA. seems to be acting like DeSantis light, trying to rewrite history and removing anything that makes America look not so perfect and the NC legislature just passes a bill forcing teachers to out Transgender students.  Encourage your peers to scream sanity and vote these hate mongers out."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,They're red.
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"I don't believe any Republican can handle the national media aside from Trump. Definitely not in the style of DeSantis who chooses to ignore them. They will invent and create their own narratives. Seen it time and time before. That said, if he can survive Trump in the primary, it's an okay litmus test for what's to come in the general."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"Yep. Republicans are assholes. 

‚ÄúWhen they go low, we go high‚Äù"
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"I just got back from sitting in the voting line for almost 3 hours, the whole time I‚Äôm looking at my fellow citizens thinking ‚Äúhow can you wait this long to vote for a ducking potato‚Äù"
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,I‚Äôll be a skeleton rotting away before Republicans do anything like this. They still have this idealistic version of these institutions.
LIBERAL,r/liberal,She wants a fox news job.  That's it.  That's why she's doing this.  She'll hit all the Republican talking points and try to poison the well.  Maybe she'll even announce Sinema as her running mate.
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"My daughter is autistic. She has challenges, but she's got a job, and she shows up on time. I'm not sure if she has episodes of 'emotional dysregulation' or 'rejection-sensitive dysphoria', but if she does, I'd expect and hope that she would be treated like anyone else."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,">Florida is the 26th state with laws on the books allowing permitless carrying of firearms

LIBERAL,r/liberal,"IMHO Democrat Michael Dukakis was a weak candidate and Lee Atwater, who ran Bush's campaign, was a shameless, amoral scumbag who would stop at nothing to win. A lot of people point at Newt Gingrich and the 1994 Congress as the beginning of the GOP becoming untethered from reality, but IMO Atwater's work shows that it goes back further than that.

In an interview in 1991, growing reflective after a nasty fight with brain cancer, Atwater apologized to Dukakis for the ""naked cruelty"" of the campaign against him in 1988."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"They don't HAVE to, they just need to be on attack which means we're ALWAYS playing defense. Sick of it."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"There are many paths to follow when it comes to a criminal indictment of Biden: The Ashley Biden diary's salacious allegations, the influence peddling in foreign countries, the tax fraud... and that's just the start.

Unlike with Trump, it wouldn't take years of investigations to come up with anything, and there'd be no need to redefine terms of law or rely on criminal witnesses to bring him to court."

LIBERAL,r/conservative,TransAm?
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"Gun ownership isn't going away, it's moot to suggest this. However, I think that an assault weapons ban, or at least much stricter gun ownership regulations are very plausible and reasonable. Even though I'm devout liberal, I support gun ownership for self defense and hunting. I don't like this whole idea and rhetoric about gun ownership as some warning to the our own government. I own an assault rifle and a few other guns, but that's mostly because I'm afraid of right wing fascists taking over."

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Just the notion of ""a constitutional-carry-majority nation"". From what I understand after reading the article it doesn't seem like that is a legally meaningful term outside of symbolism. I do think the symbolism is quite powerful though as it shows there is very strong support for the 2A in America! :)"
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"I mean, he's not wrong lol.

CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"I agree, but I think Biden's the favorite. DeSantis has a nasally voice and says he's 5'7"". 

That will cost him a fraction of Trump's machomen and he needs 100%, if not more due to Boomers dying."

CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,Sounds like you need a new roommate
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"As someone alive in the 50s, their desire is for a 50s that never existed for anyone who wasn‚Äôt a white, Christian man. A time of segregation for Blacks and subjugation for women."

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,I'm not sure how your comment relates to dressing little girls like adult women in drag and having them compete to be the prettiest. They aren't old enough to consent. I used to have to run pageants for an old job and it gave me the super icks watching parents sexualizing their kids. They even had age groups as young as a few months.
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,Griner has laid a relatively low profile since they got her back. I don‚Äôt think even she thought it was a good idea to trade an international arms dealer for her
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Y‚Äôall still in here pretending it matters who we run? As if we won‚Äôt just have another ‚Äúsafest and securest election of all time with no irregularities at all‚Äù?

LIBERAL,r/conservative,"This guy might be the biggest piece of shit in America at the moment.

CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"Now with Nikki Haley running, too. Trump should be more inclined to form a political party"
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"I think it's funny that people pointing to this saying ""see they are Nazi's"" lol"
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"I'm 54 and the people who have represented me get closer to my age every year.

LIBERAL,r/liberal,That‚Äôs an insult to Satan
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"This artificial, lifeless, monotonous idiot really believes she is going to be the first female President, doesn‚Äôt she?"
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"You‚Äôre talking about obstruction. I‚Äôm talking about mishandling of classified material which is the more dangerous crime. Yes Trump may have lied, but Biden potentially hid it for years and the walls were closing in. 

If they both share a cell, then fine. But mishandling classified material is extremely serious and Biden is guilty."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,I guess their politicians are hoping that if it happens often and long enough people will just get used to it.
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,Are you implying that you actually believe the speaker was calling for a genocide of trans people?
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"I don‚Äôt know who you think ‚Äúthey‚Äù are, but just to be clear, it was a couple conservative parents who clutched their pearls about David"
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,This is not a good sign.
LIBERAL,r/conservative,"He hasn‚Äôt. And when he does and the media shits all over him for breathing funny, he might instantly lead Trump in these."
LIBERAL,r/conservative,"Of course not. Because it doesn‚Äôt fit their agenda‚Ä¶ these people had different beliefs than them so what do they matter, right? Probably just a bunch of ‚ÄúMAGA republicans‚Äù, right?

It shouldn‚Äôt be about left and right, it should be about the fact lives were lost due to a tragic, targeted school shooting and about the cops‚Äô heroic response that saved countless other lives."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,I would as well.
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"They have threatened it for a long time.

It's been their message, and many people have thought they weren't serious about it."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"Some people really do need to change their party affiliation. MTG ran on the GOP platform issues and benefits from GOP donor PACs.

Its a shame that her voters keep overlooking her stark departure from platform principles. A united coalition of states and constitutional republic is littered throughout the last approved platform."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"Well, that used to be conservative."

They want to back pedal but agin the monsters loom."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,Y'mean socialized education?

LIBERAL,r/liberal,I think republicans are liars and con artists. Democrats are inept idiots. When we put the two together we get screwed.

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"I think your issue here is America on a macro level, vice an individual person or a community. We can debate American domestic/foreign policy all day long, but that has nothing to do with religion."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,I will be very surprised if anything is done to this loser other than a slap on the wrist.
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"Garland turned out to be such a weak, limp-wristed, milquetoast enabler it's sad. It's a shame we got 3 Trump justices on SCOTUS but in a way it's a good thing we got Jackson instead of Garland."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"So what you're afraid of is not Warnock, it's the slippery slope. 

I don't believe Warnock being President, if that were to happen, would affect the likelihood of a future president being a religious leader one way or another."

LIBERAL,r/liberal,"In addition, much of law enforcement, including the FBI, are Fox-watching Trump supporters"
LIBERAL,r/conservative,"Yeah. Things are likely going to get much worse before they get better. We could handle the bad economy, the hostile world, the inflation; what we can‚Äôt handle is how radical and hateful the left has become. Unreasonable, moronic, and fanatical."
LIBERAL,r/conservative,"It is generally like that throughout the world. Almost all parties in the western europe, asia, Autralia are economically left to democrats. But many of them are culturally right."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"I completely understand you're scared. I am a gay man, and when I was a teenager like you many years ago (I am probably more than twice your age) I had the same feelings. All you can do is have hope. There are a lot of us out here fighting for LGBTQIA rights. Try to hang in there, and don't let these people make you hate yourself. I believe we will win in the end!"
LIBERAL,r/liberal,That's easy they are all hypocrites.
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,">Vegas odds at this exact moment both Trump and DeSantis have better odds than Biden.

Most recent I can find is [here.](https://www.empirestakes.com/ny-sports-betting/presidential-election-odds) 

1Ô∏è‚É£  Joe Biden	+300	28.6%‚Üë

3Ô∏è‚É£  Ron DeSantis	+275	22.2% ‚Üì  
4Ô∏è‚É£  Nikki Haley	+1600	5.9%‚Üë

I do agree with you that what Trump does still matters, as he is shooting himself in the face constantly, and he faces multiple lawsuits and investigations. That's all still news."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,Word woke is another word for pro Putin
LIBERAL,r/conservative,"I think theres a bit of scare mo gering here,when in fact, the US are just trying to catch up with the rest of the world.
For a bit of context, the EU started phasing out incandescent bulbs over 10 years ago. At this stage, I can't even remember the last time i seen anold style bulb..

Technology has come a long way in quality and price, and if you use the correct Kelvin value, you can't even tell the difference between the two. I have never had to replace an LED bulb once, and they use very little electricity. 

Regardless of what Biden says, why would you want old shitty lights in your house  that cost you more money and have to be replaced all the time?"
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"""This week, the state-backed Citizen‚Äôs Property Insurance voted to move forward on a 14.2% rate increase for its 1.2 million policies. The rate request is above the statutory guidelines of 12%, indicating the pressure on the state-backed carrier.  
Under former Governor Rick Scott, Florida paid insurance companies to take policies off the books from Citizens to help stabilize the market and reduce exposure for the state-backed insurance carrier of last resort. Florida could start to do the same thing now; however, Governor Ron DeSantis and the legislature have not indicated that is something they are considering right now.""

Paying more for home insurance wouldn't be so frustrating if the insurance companies actually paid when damages occur but they don't or they take ages to make the pay out. And we're losing more and more carriers every year in Florida, this is an increasingly bad problem in a state where we're gaining so many new residents every day."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,Of course they do.
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"I get what you mean.

What we are seeing now, is broadly a result of a generation of people raised without the values that have helped shape mankind since the inception of modern theology"
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,Honestly kinda scared that I live in canada. Pretty sure if myself or my family were ever in serious danger I would end up in jail protecting myself.

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Doesn't that just lead to more polarization though? While personal communities should be prioritized, completely ignoring and flipping off other people's side is how we got to be so polarized in the first place. 

Then again, there's a problem of not only too much divisiveness, but also too much ""my way or the highway"" where a dialogue can't be met since both parties expect the other to either go away or join them. And I'm not quite sure how to navigate that..."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"And what happens when an idiotic right winger uses that manifesto as an excuse to attack trans people?  The wheel goes round and round. Unless there‚Äôs a broad change in FBI/CIA/ whatever 3 letter agency that‚Äôs involved in this, they will never hold the left to the same accountability as the right has. Right now it will just fan the flames. I‚Äôm a live and let live person and I don‚Äôt like what the trans movement is pushing, but I don‚Äôt think painting the whole trans movement as violent (which this manifesto could do) is a wise decision"
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,The response to Trump telling someone not to talk about something is to tell Trump to not talk about something.

LIBERAL,r/liberal,Basic human rights shouldn't be political.
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"No Republican will win the popular vote.  I don't think a Republican has done it since Reagan who won states that Republicans can't realistically win in today's political climate.  And it doesn't matter who the candidate is or their platform.  If there's an ""R"" next to their name they will lose too many states and cities to win the popular vote.  The cities carry too much of a dominating voting block.  That's why we have the electoral college system so cities can't run rough-shod over the rest of the country. Let's not forget that polls indicate potentially millions of voters would have changed their vote had the Hunter laptop story not been buried.

Regarding Trump's age, it is somewhat of a concern, but comparing his cognitive ability to Biden is laughable.  There were clear and obvious red flags with Biden's mental health from very early on in his campaign.  Trump has more energy than many people half his age.

To the main point of your post, I think Trump (and most people on the right) were woefully unprepared for the level of corruption in the non-political positions within government, particularly departments like the DOJ and State Dept.  And I think anyone stepping into that position will be similarly unprepared if they haven't personally faced it before.  I don't think anyone besides Trump (because of what he went through) could come into office with a full understanding of how harshly and radically these departments need to be treated.

DeSantis on the other hand will have the same exact mentality Trump did.  Things like firing the people who undermined him like Fauci, Rosenstein, Eric C., etc. are not easy to do for someone facing re-election.  Trump can go scorched earth on anyone undermining him without fear of re-election consequences.  After the numerous fiascos he went through he has a clear list of who's on his side and who isn't.

Aside from spending, Trump has a stellar track record from a policy perspective.  DeSantis is doing great on the state level, but Trump has a proven track record on the national level.

In no way would I be upset with DeSantis.  But I think if Trump were to roll over or primary voters chose someone else, it sets a dangerous precedent that if Democrats work hard enough to conjure up fake controversies and smear Republicans with fake crimes that they can sway our vote.  

Case in point that you cite Jan 6 when we now know there were numerous undercover LEO's in that crowd one of which was on tape inciting violence.  Even with incitement I am all for reasonable charges on anyone who engaged against police or damaged property.  But that doesn't mean that Trump did anything wrong there.  And I think it's foolish to let an event that looks more and more like a false flag by the day be used to sway your vote.  

**If we allow our votes to be swayed by propaganda and clandestine operations by intelligence agencies then we are inviting more russiagates, more Jan 6's, and more bogus impeachments**. 

Remember how Trump's popularity changed over time.  He was unpopular because of his antics, but as the media turned on him the primary voters turned to his side.  Then he was elected and Russiagate hit.  His approval numbers plunged.  But his approval rating slowly recovered because of policy and as truth came out about russiagate.  Then the impeachments and covid came and he lost approval ratings, but they rebounded by the election.

So it seems that he only lost approval ratings when completely manufactured stories came out.  Once the truth was revealed his approval ratings recovered.  Every time his approval ratings fell, he was eventually proven to be right and his ratings recovered. He lost approval ratings for being right. 

**Trump wasn't targeted for his personality.  People loved him when he was a Democrat.**   
 **They hated him for his policy.  If DeSantis turns out to be as much of a threat as Trump from a policy perspective, you can expect the exact same results from him**."

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"The Republican primary voters are much further to the right than the November voters are, so to win them you need to support policy that makes you much more likely to lose in November. 

Quite the conundrum. And the base increasingly don't care about electability and just say the result was fraudulent or stolen if they lose so there's never any introspection."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"It's not ""bigotry"" to tell someone that they are harming themselves. It's called caring. I won't be telling a woman she can be a man if she wants, because that is lying and causing permanent damage to her."

LIBERAL,r/liberal,"There is no such thing as ‚Äúliberal cancel culture‚Äù. This label is projection of an extreme right wing politics that is attempting to roll back the clock on social progress with legislation that is anti-secular, anti-choice, anti-voter, anti-science, anti-education. Right wing politics attempts to normalize its own extremism by accusing others of doing what the right wing does itself: breed intolerance.

This assertion of a cancel culture is also a characteristic of fascism: the assertion that right wing extremism is culturally pure, righteous and powerful, yet at the same time it is paradoxicallly helpless, trodden on and victimized by the rest of society. It‚Äôs a lie."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Does anyone even ask if this is what kids want to see? Frankly, I don't understand the obsession with making little kids watch grown men gyrate in front of them.

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Thank you for clarifying.  I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a very good example of an organization that would sexually abuse children on a technicality.  The sexual abuse and exploitation of children within that cult was extremely heinous.  Children were forced to use sex as a recruitment tool and were forced to have sex with many people starting at a very young age.  

I remember finding a letter from an ex-cult member who was upset about contracting an incurable STD after escaping the cult because she had managed to stay clean after all those years of having sex with different men in the cult. She was only 17.  The recipient of that letter, her sister, was one of those who claimed that her siblings were never actually touched."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"There are a lot of good reasons to switch to LED bulbs, which is why the government should not be mandating it.

Ironically, the most commonly cited reason, energy efficiency, is only situationally a benefit. The energy efficiency of LED bulbs is a benefit if you live in a warm environment. But in a cold environment the waste heat of an incandescent bulb just heats the house instead, so it's not actually a waste.

The biggest benefit is actually their longer lifespan, if you buy a good quality LED. Unfortunately there are a lot of crap LEDs on the market that die long before they should due to faulty electronics, which will probably only increase due to legislation like this."

LIBERAL,r/liberal,"Yes, but I don't think that's what she means. I think his sister is simply saying there are wackos who are Republican and Democrat that do harmful things to innocent people. But I also think that, in general, conservatives use the both sides argument knowing that the right is far more tolerant of their wackos than the left, in other words, they'll still vote for their wackos while most on the left won't continue to vote for theirs. Matt Gaetz and Al Franken are good examples of this double standard."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"Ah, so we're finally reaching the Heaven's Gate period of the GOP cult. Sad, but predictable."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,finally. we're one step closer to proving that jerk is really just two kids in a trenchcoat.

Obtaining user data from providers is not legally considered unlawful search and seizure, and it is not considered 'your' data.

CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"Nothing about the disadvantage suffered by minorities in this country implies that all white people have it easy. They have it comparatively easier than people who systematically had their wealth stolen from them and later had their efforts to generate wealth devalued in multiple ways. Redlining didn't end until the 1970s via force of law. The biggest asset most families have is their home. Suburbs after WW2 were off limits to dark people, and that's where home values increased the most.

The statistics don't support your theory. There is less upward mobility in the U.S. than in many European countries. The best way to be well off in the U.S. is to be born well off."

CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"We need to cut the FICA rates back to pre-Reagan/Greenspan Commission.  


The increase was only meant to be temporary to build a cushion for the bulge of retiring Boomers. This increase ended a 'private savings function' for too many households. The brick being shat in DC by the GOP is the day when the SocSec trust fund becomes a net draw against the government rather than a source of funds to spend. That could mean the end of low tax rates for the Uber-Rich who have been reaching into the Treasury to take out money since Reagan.

 We should ALSO raise the income cap for how much income is subject to FICA withholding. This will make up for some of the reduced rates...$500K or a $1M of income should be paying in. My own druthers would be a cap based on multiples of the median household income. Thus, the cap would not need new legislation or regulation to change with the times.  


Also, we should eliminate the matching contribution for the self-employed (and only the self-employed) at 3X or 5X of the median income.  


Lastly, any changes should be 'stepped in' over 5-7 years so as not to shock the economy into recession and to permit assessment and re-evaluation of effectiveness.  


...but we'll spend two years prosecuting a man who attempted a coup and asking ourselves if Biden is too old to run...

I've lived in a home for almost 30 years, and never once has anyone entered said home to hurt me or my family.  We've been broken into, had a few things stolen, but nobody kicked open the door with a shotgun and started spraying bullets.

The problem, IMHO, with having a gun for protection, is that the gun becomes a solution, and then more and more situations start to look like problems that gun can solve."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,No one is making this up. We have eyes.

LIBERAL,r/liberal,"It's all coming to light now.

The __demagogic temerity__ of pugnacious, narcissistic, and want-to-be fascist dictator / defeated grifter and one term former President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice)__ and the imbroglio he has foisted upon our country *knows no bounds.* Guilty __(at the very least) of extreme direlection of duty, his cognitive dissonance __moves forward unchecked.__

>*So here‚Äôs a clue as to why Donald Trump did not want anyone reading his individual tax returns. His company has just been convicted of criminal fraud for evading taxes on benefits paid to executives. The accused was Trump‚Äôs company, not Trump himself. Nor was Trump one of the executives accused of evasion. Yet the jeopardy to Trump personally is very near and very real.*

The prosecutor knew they had a good case. And pursued it.

>*New York State‚Äôs prosecutors asserted at trial that Trump had explicitly approved the evasion scheme: ‚ÄúThis is all part of the Trump executive compensation package. Free cars for you, free cars for your wife, free apartments for you, free apartments for your kids. apartments for you, free apartments for your kids. Why not pay them more? Because it would cost them double to give them raises rather than give them the cars on the down-low.‚Äù*

There is so much more on the horizon, of course. He can run, but he can't hide.

>*The jury‚Äôs verdicts cast light on a series of related questions that now loom large.*

>*Why did Trump fight all the way to the Supreme Court to conceal his individual tax returns from scrutiny?*

>*Why did Trump make such a priority of personal control of the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Justice, given his general lack of concern with the mechanics of government?*

>*Why was Trump willing to commit impeachable offenses in his effort to win the election of 2020, and then even more and worse impeachable offenses to hold on to power in 2021 after his defeat?*

The narcissistic sociopath, __unhinged insurrectionist,__ and grifter (with a pronounced case of logorrhea) known as one term twice impeached former President Trump, has a pattern of explaining, excusing, deflecting and blaming others for the circumstances he finds himself in."

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"First sentence of that article: ""John Fetterman has finally been *released* from the hospital after suffering from a reported bout of severe depression.""

He wasn't ""released"". He was discharged. That is the term we use in the medical field. Why is this important? Because it underscores that this admission was *voluntary*. He was not being held against his will. He wasn't in jail. 

Again, why important? Because it is an admission that he recognizes that he has a job-impairing disability that required inpatient treatment. This may be fine for someone who requires a FML absence in a job where your tasks can be re-assigned or someone else can be hired, even temporarily, to fill the gap. But, this was a sitting, elected U.S. Senator.

Yes, the only thing he should have been *released* from is his elected responsibility to the citizens of Pennsylvania - he should have *released* himself. In that, we electors had no say. And that was the bigger point of bullshit in all of this."

You hear stories every day about so-called welfare queens or kings. 

They were approved for food stamps. 

You have to jump through a lot of bells and hoops to get food stamps. 

They look at your bank accounts, your social security number, bills, rent or mortgage, paychecks, who you live with, and more. 

So what if you want to buy steak or lobster with your food stamps? You are allowed to do that.

So if you see someone in line buying these types of things? So what? It is food. It is purchased for their families. They will eat it. That is what food stamps are for.

I don't begrudge people buying whatever they need to buy on their food stamp allotment. Who am I to judge what they put in their mouths and stomachs?

After the pandemic level food stamps go away? Most people I know will go back to making less than $100 a month in food stamps.

My neighbor and his wife received a letter that their $ 517.00 pandemic level food stamp allotment is going to $ 23.00 per month (after February).

Not much.

Classical liberals (aka conservatives....well some conservatives) put a lot more value on Systems themselves and so grit their teeth and grumbled a lot but accepted the legal losses and tried to work out a compromise (for all the good that did them), leading to the slow march towards we see now.  Its a conflict between philosophies that view rules as a tool to an end vs viewing rules as the end themselves.

Also the old censorship wasn't monolithcally conservative as you were lead to believe, such as some of the leading voices against the violence in rap music in the 90s were......Tipper Gore and Hillary Clinton.

The ""woke war"" as he calls it is great for his state but nationally that will not work. Also restricting women's rights bit every Republican in the ass this midterm so it's definitely gonna come back harder in 2024 for the presidential race. If Republicans allow the US to default the entire nation (which is UNCONSTITUTIONAL btw) it will cause a huge revolt against Republicans as it will screw our economy for decades, hurt regular and rich citizens and cause inflation which they have been calling for being brought under control to skyrocket."

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,Chicks hate that.
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"
I get where you're coming from, and I agree that it's important for people to take responsibility for their own lives. But the reality is that not everyone has the same opportunities and resources to do that. Some people are born into poverty and face systemic barriers that prevent them from succeeding, no matter how hard they work.

That's where government programs like the federal welfare system and federal school system come in. They're designed to help level the playing field and give people a chance to succeed, regardless of their background. It's not about handouts or entitlement, it's about creating a fair and just society where everyone has a shot at success. That's the American dream right?

And let's be real, not all schools are created equal. Some schools in poor neighborhoods don't have the resources to provide a quality education, and that's not the fault of the parents or the kids. By investing in the federal school system, we can ensure that every child, regardless of their zip code, has access to a quality education that will prepare them for success in life.

I know you value hard work and self-reliance, and I do too. But we also have to acknowledge that sometimes people need a little help to get ahead, and that's where government programs can make a real difference. We all benefit when everyone has a chance to succeed, and that's something we should all be able to agree on."

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"It seems to be that your premise is simply he can‚Äôt win the majority vote. Since we do not have a national popular vote - merely a number that media and the left like to tally from State vote totals - it‚Äôs difficult to know where to begin. That is, unless the purpose of this was simply to allow space to shit on Trump. 

I personally believe both are qualified and capable and would excel in different ways for different reasons. I struggle with Trump‚Äôs attacking of DeSantis as it leaves a bad taste in my mouth being so far out from primaries and DeSantis is not even an announced candidate. Not all, but many of the arguments against Trump can be boiled down to likability. In Trump we had a person, not just q candidate, who had a national recognition before running. It was mostly positive. To think that any other candidate - assuming one that is not of the McConnell wing - won‚Äôt be made to be as loathed and vilified as Trump is naive, in my opinion. If that‚Äôs the case, why does it matter? I grant there are other arguments, too."

We should absolutely hold people accountable for being late, last-minute cancellations, etc. but we should stop making moral judgments on these traits because neurodivergent people have a disability.
‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre late for your job once then you don‚Äôt care about it.‚Äù - No, I do really care about my job, but I struggle with perceiving time and so I sometimes am late. But once I show up I am 100% in and ready to work.
‚ÄúIf you cancel on me last-minute, you don‚Äôt care about me.‚Äù - I likely canceled last-minute because I was anxious and overwhelmed about something not related to you, and I needed time to compose myself.
‚ÄúYour desk is so unorganized, you‚Äôre a messy person and therefore unreliable.‚Äù - I‚Äôm someone who needs visual reminders to get stuff done and there‚Äôs a reason behind my piles.

Should these types of needs/feelings be communicated to team members and supervisors? Absolutely. But sometimes it‚Äôs exhausting to have to explain oneself all the time.

But I'll just add that it doesn't come down to choice.

 Many people vote conservative because they've had a shit education (not their choice), grew up in religious households with little exposure to the outside world (also not their choice). Literally every one they know has the same uninformed opinions. When they do occasionally hear a liberal argument, it's straw-manned into nonsense. 

You're assuming these people are unreachable because they've consciously made a decision to be ignorant, but actually they haven't had much agency in forming those beliefs. And when you write them off as unredeemable, you're just pushing them further into what you don't want them to be.

Being afraid of change will not stop it from happening.

Change is needed so that the billionaires like one term twice impeached former President Trump and his cronies pay taxes.

Do you think it's OK for him to pay ""$ 0"" in taxes?

I don't.

That needs to change.

The IRS was short staffed and they did not have enough people assigned / going over his taxes? What?

Even though it is mandated by the IRS that all presidential taxes be audited and made available. As a matter of fact? You could go online today and find tax returns of former presidents.

Just Google it.

In actuality? I can't wait for the IRS Commissioner (that did the dirty work) for one term twice impeached former President Trump to come before Congress. 

Oh? Least we forget? 

That might not happen because the Republicans are doing away with so many processes in place to stop autocratic progression in America.

You do need to protect that pre-existing natural individual right (per Cruikshank) if you want people to be able to show up with their arms in a militia. There is no historical consensus on this restrictive reading though. The idea that the right is somehow tied to militia membership didn't even exist in the federal courts until 1942, and the ""collective right"" wasn't formulated in such terms until 1976.

LIBERAL,r/liberal,"Basically?

This bill is meant to keep audits from happening in regards to their rich friends. 

It will cost the American taxpayers $ 114 billion dollars as it is currently written.

>*The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which analyzes bills for lawmakers, reported in an analysis on Monday that the GOP's IRS measure, known as the Family and Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act, from Rep. Adrian Smith, R-Neb., would raise the deficit by $114 billion.*

That's a lot of money for Republicans who __*claim* they want to save Americans money.__

Republicans tried fear mongering to try to send fear into the homes of Americans, even to the point of claiming that all of the new hires would be armed. And that they would go after lower and middle class Americans.

It's __one of their infamous tactics.__

>*Republicans claimed throughout the midterm campaign that Democrats were sending ""an army of IRS agents"" to go after middle- and lower-class taxpayers with the new agency funding in the IRA, which passed along party lines last year. Some Republicans even went so far as to suggest that the IRS agents would be armed.*

The manipulative fearmongering of the grifter known as one term twice impeached former President Trump, and his minions are something Americans don't want.

They __made it clear__ in the last election.

In actuality? 87,000 employees of the IRS are slated to be hired. Not all of them have the ability to audit, nor will all of them be agents. 

Many employees of the IRS are slated to leave due to retirement, changing jobs, etc. The new personnel and other changes will take place __over a 10-year span.__

Republicans __do not want__ IRS employees to be hired. Nor do they want the IRS, its facilities, and IT systems to be updated - something they have desperately needed for a long time. 

The Republicans make it seem like the employees __would be hired today,__ which is not true. The changes take place over the *span of a decade.*

They have continuously fought funding to provide personnel, facility, and technological upgrades to the IRS to __protect their friends, lobbyists, and corporate supporters.__

>*The IRS has said it plans over the next decade to use the roughly $80 billion from the IRA to update its antiquated technology systems, after years of under-funding by Congress, and hire and train new information technology specialists and customer service representatives as well as new agents, only a small fraction of whom -- in the Criminal Investigation division -- are armed.* 

Some of those people will have jobs to assist with auditing people like one term twice impeached former President Trump and his cronies. 

It's __very much needed.__

Obviously? 

Any *billionaire* __who pays 0 in taxes?__ Or even $750 during another year? And has many friends and cronies who do the __exact same thing?__

Needs to be audited.

And their red headed leader is not the only one.

While __my family and others__ pay so much more? 

Period.

We need the money. And they need to pay their share.

That is all we are asking for. 

We __want them to pay their fair share.__

What is wrong with that?

Added part about the cost of the Republican bill. Added part about facilities being upgraded. Added highlights. Added part about protecting lobbyists."

CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,">If they cared about stopping shootings, they‚Äôd go after gang bangers.

Not sure where you reach that conclusion as at the top of my head I know that's incorrect and have looked up the stats now to back that up:

""According to the National Gang Center, the government agency responsible for cataloging gang violence, there was an average of fewer than 2,000 gang homicides annually from 2007 to 2012. During roughly the same time period (2007 to 2011), the Federal Bureau of Investigation estimated an average of more than 15,500 homicides annually across the United States, indicating that gang-related homicides were approximately 13% total homicides annually.""

""The Bureau of Justice Statistics finds the number of gang-related homicides to be even lower. In 2008, the government agency identified 960 homicides, accounting for 6% of all homicides that year. ""

Also it's just about emotions. Most undocumented immigrants and those that cross the border are not violent nor criminals (other than breaking law of entering country and working). Plus they economically are a net benefit to USA and for the most part don't take jobs away from average American. Yet Republicans have hysteria over it nonetheless. They also don't target business owners who employ then and instead focus on individuals. Trump's wall would never stop or seriously hinder illegal immigration nor does it impact majority that over stay visas. Each side has an issue they are emotional about and solutions are not reasonable or ineffective.

>The risk from owning a gun is from suicide not accidents. Again, adding suicides into the stats is highly misleading.

That is not entirely accurate. Accidental discharges and kids getting a hold of guns are factors as well. You are also incorrect to say it's misleading due to suicides if we are talking about risk of death from owning a gun."

I do think that the owner of 141 franchises should pay a hell of a lot higher tax rate than the 141 owners of 1 franchise each. Maybe 3 to 5 times as much, specifically to discourage the problems OP is worried about.  

I think that our tax structure should be pushing the owners of successful business toward divestiture. If you can successfully generate sufficient income to support an extraordinarily lavish lifestyle, you should be pushed - hard - to transfer excessive shares to other people, entitling them to a share of your business's profits. You can choose to offer them to employees, or sell them to investors (who would also have their own ""lavish lifestyle"" limits). Or you can reduce your excessive income by increasing your payroll expenses: paying your workers a greater percentage of the money they earn you. 

If you are obscenely wealthy and don't want to divest ownership or increase your payroll, you'll pay an obscene amount of taxes.   You can ""lift up"" yourself and the people who helped you get to the top, or you will be ""dragged down"", and let the government decide how your money will be spent."

So to compare transgender people to something that nobody has ever identified as, that is making trans people sound insane. There's nothing insane about talking about your own gender.

But I do understand that you're just making an argument and you're not trying to be anti-trans. But maybe you are a little and you don't realize that.

LIBERAL,r/liberal,"If I was the lawyers in this case, I would have fought tooth and nail to get that vet an earlier effective date, and I would have pushed it just as far as these litigants did...

But this was a hail Mary. So basically, the law in question here (38 USC 5110(b)(4)) says you are entitled to an effective date equal to your date of discharge *if you were permanently and totally disabled at discharge*, and unable to apply for benefits.

Perm-total is a specific designation that applies to many *but not all* disabled vets who are 100% disabled. So you can have a disability rating of 100%, but not be considered ""permanently and totally disabled"" by the VA (which only really matters in a few very important instances, like this).

SO, the vets advocates in this case were trying to get the court to apply a fairness doctrine called equitable tolling, and expand 5110(b)(4) to cover vets who *are not perm-total* which would include me, and millions of other vets who could now flood the VA with applications for an earlier effective date.

Is it a loss for vets? Technically yes. Is it a huge kick in the pants for vets advocates trying to expand their benefits? Not really."

LIBERAL,r/liberal,"""How to privatize education? How could that work?""

It's pretty simple. There are private schools all over the country. Many of them charge lots of money for kids to attend. They can teach (or not) whatever they want, with little government control. Conservatives want to avoid government control which could require them to teach facts like evolution theory and the history of slavery, while prohibiting teaching straight from the bible. Liberals want kids to learn real science and facts. Liberals also want all kids to get a good education at a cost that everyone can afford. Public schools have, in the past, provided access to a quality education paid for by taxes, and available to all.

The right wing wants to end public education so they can teach flat earth and bible. They prefer to discriminate between races and gender and wealth in deciding which kids get a decent education. And they want the rich to profit from running schools, partly to justify elimination of Boards of Education."

LIBERAL,r/liberal,"OED definition of liberal = broad.

What does this mean you say? 

Broad, as in many ways of accomplishing something. Many solutions. Many strategies to solving problems. One way may work for this group, another way may be better for another group. 

Liberal political theory fits very well with freedom and free markets which consists of providers producing a variety of goods and services through 3 main avenues: 1) the private sector, 2) the public sector, and, 3) the households. All three must be robust and thriving. Each has an integral role to play in a healthy nation state. People then can maximize their ability to solve problems.

The private sector mainly focuses on routine production (making dog food, building cars over and over), the public sector mainly focuses on thorny, complex problems and problems that are not profitable for the private sector (poverty, discrimination, public health and safety, justice etc). Households focus on individual level issues like raising good citizens, who are healthy, law-abiding, engaged in their communities. 

Now compared this to the word conservative which means 1 solution, the old solution. The status quo. As such it has always had a strong tendency to lean toward the power of authoritarianism by default because human nature wants to be creative and free, and conservatives don't want that ergo conservatism is always seeking to curtail these urges and passions. It also pairs well with exclusion, narrowing opportunity, creating false scarcity, and limits."

Common sense says that he was a thief and should be questioned, but when people get shot everyone gets super focused on the details.

TLDR: In NY, simple trespassing and even theft are not crimes in which lethal force would be permitted. A garage attended doesn't have authority to be a vigilanty, and the alleged thief's lawyer or public defendant would likely argue that the illegal detaining of the suspected thief is what led to the shooting.

CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,">Ideology.

>Our primary predictor was a mutually exclusive categorical variable and included individuals who were identified as committed to Islamist, right-wing, or left-wing causes. Examples of groups supporting Islamist ideology included al-Qaeda and Hezbollah; examples of groups supporting right-wing ideology included the Ku Klux Klan and the National Alliance; and examples of groups supporting left-wing ideology included the Animal Liberation Front and the Weather Underground. Right-wing supporters represented 59%, left-wing 23%, and Islamist 18% of the sample. We created two dummy-coded variables with far-right ideology as the reference category.

Yep, the [Animal Liberation Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Liberation_Front) and the [Weather Underground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_Underground) are definitely big players in US liberal politics (I say this as a 'radical' environmentalist.)


>The findings from two studies, characterized by very different scopes and units of analysis, provide substantial support for conclusions about the relationship between ideology and the use of politically motivated violence. **First, data on extremists in the United States showed that left-wing radicals were less likely to use violence than right-wing and Islamist radicals**. Second, using worldwide data we found that in comparison to right-wing and Islamist groups, attacks motivated by left-wing groups were less deadly. These substantive conclusions were not affected by the inclusion of a set of control variables. Thus, the main findings appear to be robust across levels of analysis (i.e., individuals, groups) and geographical scope of the data.

>**Our results are in line with past research showing that conservative ideology‚Äîrepresented in our datasets by both right-wing and Islamist causes‚Äîis positively related to violent political behavior. These results support the view that left-wing and right-wing extremists are not equivalent when it comes to the use of violence** (48; see also [49] for related findings on the victims of hate crimes in the United States). Whereas our findings are not inconsistent with the idea that individuals espousing different ideologies may feel equally negative toward worldview-threatening others (50), they suggest that the social consequences of extreme right-wing hostility may be more harmful than those caused by the far left (see [50] for a similar point)."

Do you think republicans aren‚Äôt politicians? Or that once elected they aren‚Äôt **literally** the government? You‚Äôre still blinding yourself with party politics. Judge individual politicians by their actual actions and voting records. If you trust their words over their actions you‚Äôve already lost to their game

Anyone who claims membership of **any** political party should be inherently distrusted. Political parties do not care about anything other than that party holding power. Anything else they say is lip service to buy votes.

CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Most employers or organizations have Policies and Processes to follow,. such as (a loose generic example):

* a pattern of employee behavior starts cropping up.. your Supervisor or Manager talks to you about it,. maybe gives you a verbal warning (assuming of course.. the pattern is an obvious thing.. such as ""you were late to work 7 days in a row"".. or some other unarguable violation)

* If the pattern continues (even after verbal warning). .you're given a written warning and given a time-scope to correct the behavior (maybe 30 days, 60 days, 90 days etc) 

* If you still don't correct the behavior.. multiple written warnings turn into HR action to put you on PIP (performance improvement plan) or maybe just flat terminated (depending on the severity of the violation,. say for example you are sexually harrassing other employees,. that could be severe enough to just get you immediately terminated).. or other safety related examples like drunk-driving. 

This is less of a ""hard policy"" thing.. and more of a ""how (ethically) do you treat your employees?""

* If you know an Employee is going through a hard time (depression, death of a significan other, house burned down ,. etc).. your Organization may not have any policy around that,. but it is the correct and ethical thing to give them a bit more understanding and flexibility 

* You can't discriminate against specific individual employees. So whatever Policy or allowances have to be fair and equitable across all your employees. if an Employee wants to be on a modified schedule for religious reasons (Muslim, Catholic during Lent, etc).. or if a Pregnant woman evolves through her pregnancy,. or if a specific Employee is neuro-divergent (autistic, diagnosed with ADHD, diagnosed with some specific Depressive condition, etc).. you may be legally obligated to use good judgement to shape some accommodations around them. 

How an organization treats it's people.. is more about just ""good human ethical behavior"".. than it is ""what you're legally obligated to do""."

This wasn‚Äôt the parents influence - the toys and clothes they had tried were enough evidence for me that this wasn‚Äôt them pushing it on the child. After a year of a child psychologist, they enrolled him into a pre school as a girl, psychologist talking to the caretakers and everything. Not the richest family around so this would have been not cheap for them.

It‚Äôs actually really scary how parents not ready for this suffer too. Trying your best doesn‚Äôt work when you‚Äôre trying in completely the wrong direction for what the child is interested in! I hope they continue to stick to their guns of letting the child grow up naturally rather than letting their kid get put on hormones at 7-8 years old. The kid was 4 when it was first brought up ffs.

The parents pushing it on their kids and the people doing it for clout seriously frustrate me as the reality of it is not as easygoing as its made out to be. ‚ÄúAccepting‚Äù it and actually doing what‚Äôs right are two separate things and its serious stress for a new family! Is encouraging it better or is being neutral about it better or should you push for more masculine traits slowly over time?

Watching this from the side gave me an easy set of views on ‚Äúis this really the case or is this the parent‚Äù - is it being celebrated or is it seen as an insane challenge?

>*A group of 40 House Democrats, led by Rep. David Cicilline (R.I.), introduced legislation on Thursday to bar former President Trump from holding future federal office under the 14th Amendment. Section 3 of the amendment states that no one who previously took an oath to support the Constitution and engaged in ‚Äúinsurrection or rebellion‚Äù shall ‚Äúhold any office, civil or military, under the United States.‚Äù*

Wouldn't it be wonderful if they could get this passed before the new Congress is sworn in?  The chances of that happening are pretty slim, but it sure is nice to think about.

It's interesting to note that a __criminal conviction is not necessary__ for someone to be disqualified.

>*One point of agreement, including by the¬†judge in Greene‚Äôs case, seems to be that a criminal conviction is not required for an individual to be disqualified by Section 3.*

It's as clear as the nose on anyone's face that one term twice impeached former President Trump tried to destroy America. He is still trying to do so - to this very day.

>*Cicilline said in a release announcing the legislation that Trump ‚Äúvery clearly‚Äù engaged in an insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021, with the intention of overturning the results of the 2020 presidential election. ""You don‚Äôt get to lead a government you tried to destroy,‚Äù he said. The bill also specifically describes how Trump helped encourage the violence on Jan. 6, tried to intimidate state and federal officials when they did not support his false claims of the election being stolen and refused to denounce the mob that stormed the Capitol for hours during the riot. ""The 14th Amendment makes clear that based on his past behavior, Donald Trump is disqualified from ever holding federal office again and, under Section 5, Congress has the power to pass legislation to implement this prohibition,‚Äù Cicilline said.*

I don't know if they have enough time to get this bill sent to the Senate? But let's hope so.

LIBERAL,r/liberal,"""22 liberal channels""? What is this congresscritter smoking, and may I have some?

The only ONE I can think of that skews liberal is Free Speech TV (available as a Roku app or from its website, and some satellite carriers). It carries Thom Hartmann's show, it carries 'Democracy Now!' with Amy Goodman (itself available as a standalone Roku app), among other programs.

Let me put it this way: Those of us who are left of center have stayed put for the most part on most core issues (social and economic) while those right of center have gone so far to the right (especially on social issues) they've run past the goalposts and out of the stadium altogether. The funny thing is they have the gall to deride even mainstream Democratic Party members ""communists,"" not just the much-more left congressional cohort exemplified by, say, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or Primila Jayapal.

When I was younger I used to hate-read the then-Daily Oklahoman when Eddie Gaylord was still alive and running it, because it was a gobsmackingly blindly conservative rag in those days. I also used to hate-read The Lawton Constitution when the Bentleys still ran it, especially when they'd give their by-then (early 1990s) retired editorial page editor, Ted Ralston, a guest column -- outrageously hateful, homophobic git that guy was (disclosure: I was living in Lawton in those days. Let's just say I will never return there).

At one time I used to subject myself to the online edition of the Washington Times until I just couldn't take it anymore. I sometimes read the Daily Mail (UK), which is just garbage that reads like a tawdry tabloid and has earned the nickname ""Daily Fail"" for a reason. 

I can't bring myself to watch Fox News, OAN, or Newsmax. The little time I spend watching television--an appliance, to me, that in my house is largely only reserved for sports and whatever I want to stream, is too valuable to me to waste it on shite like that. 

In the second place, people should limit their viewing of any cable news, yes even MSNBC, because all cable news is profit-driven and needs eyeballs, and that means putting on the air whatever might attract those eyeballs. The only host I'll still watch on MSNBC is Rachel Maddow--who's only on once a week now (I'm a lot more interested in her long-form projects, also I think people forget she's not a journalist by formal training, but an academic who ""fell into"" journalism, and I rather like that she approaches her show with an academic's attitude rather than a journo's).

One nitpick: PBS NewsHour is indeed long-running--50 years--but the longest-running US TV program in history is also a news program: NBC's 'Meet the Press.' Assuming Chuck Todd doesn't run it into the ground between now and November, it will have been on the air for 76 YEARS (debut: November 6, 1947)."

A) people do not adopt something that is harder to say.. language evolves to have less syllables and things that are easier to say get adopted. 

B) the new word gets the modifier not the old word..

I will explain but it's pretty involved.  Back in 2018 a catholic high school in Indianapolis fired a female guidance counselor who had worked there for 15 years because she was in a same-sex marriage.  Apparently it was common knowledge at that high school that she was in that same sex marriage.  The head of the Indiana Department of Education at the time was a democrat whose position at the time was voted on by the voters of Indiana.  She had a news conference saying she did not want to be considered to continue to be the Head of the Indiana Department of Education in 2020, because now the Head of the Department of Education was appointed by the governor, no longer voted on by the voters of Indiana and the administration was republican.  Someone asked her at this conference what she thought about the situation at that catholic high school.  She said she didn't think that any school that discriminated should receive tax money.  Indiana State Representative Bob Behning (Republican-Indianapolis) said that it wasn't the school that got the tax money, it was the parents and that if was an issue of religious freedom where the parents who received this money sent their kids.

I went to catholic schools for 12 years.  I left that piece of üí© religion 49 years ago at the age of 20.  I don't know how my head didn't explode when I heard Bob Behning's comment. I'm so sick of these people trying to shove religion on society."

HRC's winning and inauguration would probably have only added $2T to the debt rather than Trump's $8.6T, saved 700K Americans from death by COVID - Hillary would not have deconstructed Obama's pandemic framework and listened to the science - USA matching Canada's deaths per million would yield 700K fewer deaths - and certainly there would have been no attempted coup if Hillary lost her bid for re-election.  
   
I'd have taken headlines of ""Bill Caught Boinking Interns Again!"" any day of the week over one more 'achievement' by Trump and Co."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"Well, if you're asking why people support an economic system, it probably has something to do with believing in the economic principles.  Seeing x or y issue arise doesn't change that.  They try to alleviate it through policy just like any other system.  

The other reason is being very skeptical how or if another system would work at all, let alone work better."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"> If it were as Pelosi argues, a person would be forced to prove a negative ‚Äî that they did not do something, which is almost impossible. That is why the law presumes an accused person is innocent until proven guilty. An accused person does not have to prove his innocence"
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,Amen. If we‚Äôd only been allowed to ignore his grift in 2015 we‚Äôd have been better off.
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,I challenge you to listen to Nancy Pelosi and make this statement again.
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,":/ It's not like he will win...

He lost in 2000, 2016, and in 2020(every election he has been in)"
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Thanks, but I'm completely serious. Even if you handed me 5 million dollars, I wouldn't move back to my home red state."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"The same people who watch Colbert are the same ones who voted for Fetterman, braindead."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"He lost money into his friends pockets. So, that guy is winning gov contracts and banking. On Florida tax dollars"
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"Looks like:  This is an insincere leading statement trying to establish themselves as part of the ‚Äògroup‚Äô and make people feel left out and uncool if they aren‚Äôt part of ‚Äòmoving on‚Äô that the poster is advocating.

I would bet money that later in this thread the poster goes full mask-off and dives into Q adjacent conspiracy theory territory.

I‚Äôll scroll down and if I‚Äôm wrong will edit this comment with contrition.

EDIT: I was correct.  Im not surprised but I‚Äôm still disappointed."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,He‚Äôll probably nominate Trumpf.
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,Either pack the court or abolish it.. Our democracy does not need a branch of unelected people abusing such vast power against the will of the majority of citizens.
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"Does it matter at all that the program he exposed was ruled illegal? 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Moalin"
LIBERAL,r/liberal,Joe Biden?
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Look, insurrection!  And also look, more insurrection‚Ä¶!"
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,"Chilling.

He hired four people to shoot at the homes of Democrats. Then he told them he wanted them to ""aim lower"" and shoot earlier because maybe the victims ""would not be laying down""."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"I‚Äôm not defending trump at all, that was also mishandling. Heck, Trump and Biden can both share a cell. 

I agree with Nancy Pelosi when she said that anyone mishandling classified documents like that is unfit for public service."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,It is always worth posting.  I chuckle everytime.
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"$400k is someone who is an MD and studied for 15 years. Tbh, $400k puts you in upper middle class, not rich if we are talking about HCOL. Many upper middle class people will be impacted if the bar is just $400k.

This is coming from someone who makes 1/4th of that."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,They want more mass shootings.
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"There are other reasons too. People get their news and learn from TikTok. People discuss all sorts of topics, by doing stitches to other videos and doing video replies to commented question. It is both a social media platform and also a search engine. With user generated content/news/information, it eliminates the need for media and government narrative. They don‚Äôt like this."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"I don't think Manchin comprehends just how extreme his party has become, especially in the House."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,"The 80 year old who has the incumbency advantage and the increasing approval ratings?

There is no one better equipped to defeat whoever the Republican nominee is. Who would you prefer anyway? You haven‚Äôt made any suggestions. Kamala Harris? She would lose."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,Because someone said Medicare for all and that would do away with classism.
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,Romney I can respect but don't agree with his policies.
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,Reddit politics in a nutshell
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"There's a shitload of Republicans in California. Just like anywhere else though, blue rules in the population centers. I get a kick out of my friends to the north east of me up towards Chico and Redding that are all in on the ""State of Jefferson""."
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"If it's never discovered... And I think you're underestimating just how reliant the rest of NATO is on the US. The only other country with a large military in NATO is Turkey, and well... 

If faced with an existential threat, I think Germany would begrudgingly overlook its largest NATO ally taking out infrastructure, especially if that NATO ally is in turn supplying it with what the pipeline was providing.

And you assume that Biden is more than a mouthpiece. I think it's fair to suggest that more than one person currently holds the power of that particular office.  They just need Biden to publicly back it.  I could be wrong, though, and that's ok."
CONSERVATIVE,r/liberal,Are you certain of that?
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Always found Bill Maher interesting. I remember when he got his show cancelled after 9/11 and the immediate Afghan war and Sean Hannity of all people defended him against the then-cancellation-crowd equivalent.  In another 20 years, this dude is going to be a right-winger!"
CONSERVATIVE,r/conservative,"Yes, we're talking about the same thing."
LIBERAL,r/conservative,"This, tbh I‚Äôm not sure we can even agree on what ‚Äúconservative‚Äù values are. But more to the point on the topic as a whole, I hate that we look to the government for any sort of social guidance because that‚Äôs another step away from freedom. Yes Americas values are changing but the solution is not more governance."
LIBERAL,r/liberal,I just do not have the patience to listen to ANY of their lunatic Dunning-Kruger üêÉüí©
