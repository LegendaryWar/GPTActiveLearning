I imagine the Florida Subs going to have a meltdown here at some point,0
"Good that Florida is joining the ranks. 

Sad that still half the country doesn't already have this. But 100% will never happen. Democrat states will never allow it.",0
2A is pretty clear.,0
Every state should be Constitutional carry....it's the absolute law.,0
">Florida is the 26th state with laws on the books allowing permitless carrying of firearms  
  
I assume this majority situation is purely symbolic rather than having any legal effect but still, damn this is huge. The second amendment is as strong as ever. The right of the people to keep and bear arms

"Wait what does this mean for Florida, I'm out of the loop.

I've watched a lot of that fisherman guy who open carries, is that fishing rule no longer nessessary for him?",0
New York will be passing new gun laws in response to Florida passing the constitutional carry law.,0

"Prior to 2020 I probably would‚Äôve been one of those clowns freaking out about this too. I *used* to believe in ‚Äúcommon sense gun laws‚Äù then I saw the country devolve into absolute tyranny.

 Now I‚Äôm a firm believer in ‚Äúshall not be infringed‚Äù and I‚Äôm trying to move to a state with these laws. My city is a total liberal shithole overrun with crime and I‚Äôm sick of being defenseless.",0
"That's just Monday. And Tuesday. And all the other days. 

I'm a Floridian and I'm pleased as punch with this change. My only concern is I haven't seen whether this also gets rid of the silly 3 day waiting period in Florida. Part of the reason I got my permit in the first place was so I wouldn't have to wait 3 days to bring my own property home.",0
When does that cesspool not have a meltdown ?,0
I actually wonder if enough states go constitutional carry that SCOTUS might make a ruling that would effectively give constitutional carry nationwide.,0
Democrat states are already actively ignoring recent judicial rulings.,0
As someone who visits the worst gun control states: it's all virtue signalling. People vote for anti-cc laws but many of them carry weapons themselves.,0
Can't wait to see how they claim this is what a Stalin or Castro would do.,0
Democrat DA‚Äôs will give amnesty to criminals for illegal guns only,0
">	The law allows eligible citizens 21 years of age and up to carry without asking the government for a permit and without paying a fee.

Seems to be more than symbolic thankfully.",0
"But the Founders never imagined an *automatic* gun! 

*Uh, the Founders never imagined the internet, either.*

THATS (D)IFFERENT!",0
What makes it symbolic? So its not actually legal?,0
"Open carrying is only legal in Florida when you're in the wild (hunting or fishing), or on the way to or from the wild. This doesn't change that. What does change is that he won't need a permit to conceal his weapon in the bait shop or grocery store on the way out for a nice weekend on the boat.",0
"It means that as long as you're 21 years old and up, you can concealed carry any legally owned firearm without needing to apply for a license.

""Constitutional carry"" usually implies open carry, which the Florida bill does **NOT** do - it's still basically illegal to open carry in most situations. The fisherman guy is basically staging a pro-2A protest. It's legal to open carry while hunting or fishing - so he just carries a fishing pole and several guns, and walks towards bodies of water to prove the point of how silly he believes that rule is.",0
"open carry is usually legal even in many anti-2a states (although they restrict it wherever they can)

  Constitutional carry generally gets rid of the need of a permit to conceal carry",0
"Criminals already are, we should let law abiding citizens do the same.",0
that's the worst part of it! You can't be victimized for wanting to defend yourself from actual physically violent criminal behavior. The perpetrators of the crimes are considered victims of society,0
Yea I can't wait to move to Florida myself so much freedom there.,0
"> ‚Äúcommon sense gun laws‚Äù 

Just look at what common sense tik tok laws look like.",0
Love how a lot of pro-gunners were anti-gunners themselves at first. I know cause I was one too.,0
"The gay marriage ruling, if they decide to use it as precedent, might make it happen. That was part of the justification for forcing marriage to be accepted in all states.",0
"They enact anti-2a laws, judge shoots it down, they rescind it, and enact another similar law. Rinse and repeat. 

If a Republican state did that, the democrat controlled media would be having a field day",0
New York passed new gun laws in response to SCOTUS rulings. New York made any place people gather a 'sensitive area'. That means gun free zones.  All mass shootings have occurred in gun free zones. It's against NY law to have and wear a bullet proof vest. New York criminals have a distinct advantage.,0
"I'm originally from Illinois so, yeah... I know exactly what you mean. Kind of Hippocratic if you ask me. They say I want to carry mine but no one else can carry. So yeah...",0
Why symbolic?,0
"Just the notion of ""a constitutional-carry-majority nation"". From what I understand after reading the article it doesn't seem like that is a legally meaningful term outside of symbolism. I do think the symbolism is quite powerful though as it shows there is very strong support for the 2A in America! :)",0
"Even if you have the right to open carry, I don't think it's wise. If a POS wants to do something evil, he'll take you out first. Of course, there's the argument that if he sees an open-carry, he might reconsider...",0
It would be a very interesting month that‚Äôs for sure,0
Ehhhhh its not perfect but it ain't California,0
It's the problem is a lot of them are now pro-gun but they'll still vote Democrat,0
I just might die of laughter if by forcing states to accept gay marriages Democrats ultimately make states accept out of state carry permits.,0
"If someone gave Liberty Doll her own media channel, this type of hypocrisy would blasted non-stop.",0
Ooh you mean nationwide. But the actual FL law will be legal correct?,0
"Agreed. I've lived in places with open carry and have always supported it, but if I'm going somewhere I feel the need to carry, I prefer to keep it concealed.",0
"I think that ruling was a horrible act of judicial activism. But if the court plans on keeping it around as precedent, might as well. The difference is that marriage has no basis in the constitution while the 2nd amendment does. So this might have more legitimacy with such an argument.",0
Definitely,0
"But now you don't have to pass an arbitrary ""what is concealed"" test.  I don't know about you, but up here in WI a lot of CC'ers are pretty obvious about what they're carrying.",0
The way the bill is written it seems like it‚Äôs only purpose is to trample the first amendment,0
He‚Äôs right you know,0
He‚Äôs right you know,0
durrrrr freedum of speech dont mean freedum from consequences /s,0
"Bill should have been one sentence. 

They're going after vpn usage here xD",0
"No, no.

It‚Äôs also there to trample on the 4th amendment.",0
So right you said it twice.,0
And I‚Äôll keep saying it lol,0
I highly doubt Trump will stop talking,0
"This might have been their plan the whole time.  Take a case the state will likely lose and use it as a vehicle to place gag orders on a presidential candidate throughout the election.  

It has been reported that the trial might not even take place until after the election so that would give democrats the ability to prevent trump from speaking on anything that is polling well for him (like weaponization of government, political persecution, etc).",0
Doubt that the gag order would prevent selective leaks from the democrats.,0
"‚ÄúWhen you remove a man‚Äôs tongue you do not prove him a liar, you only show that you fear what he might say‚Äù",0
From the same Democrat courts that prosecute robbery **victims** and not the criminal that tried to murder the innocent person.,0
a single NY judge has the power to throw this country in to utter chaos. And i'm sure they're loving every second of it.,0
"Lol. Our fake charges are now being silenced by a gag order cause it‚Äôs not about guilt or the trial, it‚Äôs about the headline reading we arrested trump.

Kangaroo court",0
"DO IT. PLEASE PLEASE DO IT.

See how that goes",0
"I can‚Äôt see this upheld if they do impose one. Gag orders are already murky, and they want to oppose one on a former president and current presidential candidate? This already isn‚Äôt going to be a fair trial. There‚Äôs nothing that Trump could say, that he hasn‚Äôt already said, that would bias the trial any further than it is.",0

"Good luck with that, your ""honor""",0
Go to another judge and get it removed.,0
Trump's biggest downfall is he doesn't know when to stop talking lol they're giving the man a gift.,0
L O L,0
Then he can make those cool memes with duct tape on his mouth.,0
More and more of a kangaroo court daily...,0
Gag order should be challenged in federal court.  This is a political trial and Trump has 1st amendment rights.  Courts shouldn't be allowed to shut down speech that they don't like.,0
This has to be an onion headline,0
What a shit showüòî,0
Whelp. This is becoming more fucked by the day.,0
"Trump has a lot of fight in him. Wish we didn‚Äôt have to resort doing it.  Whether he talks and goes to jail or he is exonerated, this country is majorly fcuked beyond repair. The cancer has metastasized and it‚Äôll be a matter of time before it‚Äôll be over. The left ruined everything.",0
The response to Trump telling someone not to talk about something is to tell Trump to not talk about something.,0
"Stupid question, but how does a judge have the power to even give a gag order?",0
"Don't ""gag orders"" on a case typically apply to the defendants *and* the prosecution.",0
That judge should be impeached.,0
good luck with that!! /s,0
Good luck enforcing that ‚Ä¶,0
Bwahahahahaa!,0
Honestly this might be the best thing that happens to Trump.  The chances he fires off some insult or attack on the judge or says something that could be twisted into him making threats are high.,0
Haha that's rich,0
Good luck with that!,0
How is something like that even legal/Constitutional to tell someone they're not allowed to talk about their own trial?,0
"Then they will jail him.

Never thought I would see an American Alexei Navalny in my lifetime but here we are....",0
That‚Äôs the point.  They have NOTHING on him.  They‚Äôll use his breaking the gag order to have SOMETHING.,0
Obviously. He will not speak. He will furiously type on Truth Social and do another rally.,0
"The judge cannot tell Trump he can't talk.  The gag order has to be very specific to the case, which in this case is anything to do with Stormy Daniels.  I'm sure they'll try to expand that gag order, but the reality is he could sue the state and SCOTUS would knock that shit down in record time, like they have before.",0
A gag order concerning the trial would not prevent a candidate from campaigning and talking about issues.,0
" The 1st amendment right of a candidate, political speech, and a political party - the highest value speech that exists in the US. If the gag order impacts that, Trump and GOP can cause a lot of rightful uproar.  Itll be interesting to see how exactingly narrow any gag order would be.  Otherwise, I think its beyond stupid to not expect 10 fold blowback on the judge/state.",0
That's exactly what this is.,0
"So nasty, disgusting tactic.",0
"Yeah. Very convenient that, without a conviction, the judicial branch will stop him from campaigning and deplatform him.",0

At this point, I honestly do not know what the answer is, but I know we have to play by the rules, or we can not effectuate change.",0
"Trump's biggest strength is he insists upon talking about things that are verboten by our uniparty overlords. Whenever he speaks publicly with a big enough megaphone, his approval rate climbs.",0
"100%.  If a gag order is put in place, he will hang himself...he just can't help it.",0
"Nope. This silences a presidential candidate throughout the duration of a campaign. Weaponization of government, corruption, political prosecution are all off the table for him if this happens.",0
"I get your point, but it's a really ominous infringement of the First Amendment... silencing a declared candidate for President?  This is the stuff dictators do.",0
More accurately they can hold him in contempt of a non federal court which may well trigger a dick waving contest with the secret service who definitely isn't letting him go to normal person jail and may not feel beholden to any state court,0
Does he not speak at rallies?,0
The Trump team must be giddy. You can‚Äôt buy this kind of publicity- and the idea of a local judge attempting to send a former President and current opposition front runner to jail over a ‚Äúgag order‚Äù is ludicrously newsworthy.,0
"But you know almost all questions to him are guaranteed to be framed in the context of the indictment, especially during debates, as a way to get him into saying a little *too* much, right? 

‚ÄúMr. President Trump, given your recent indictment, how can Americans expect x, y, and z?‚Äù 

‚ÄúMr. President Trump, given your recent indictment, why should Americans feel confident that you won‚Äôt be found guilty and thrown in jail?‚Äù 

While the gag order doesn‚Äôt necessarily stop him from talking about the economy, immigration, etc., he might not be able to control that once debates start coming around.",0

Trump: I'm holding **you** in contempt.

Judge: you aren't the judge you can't do that. 

Trump: not that kind of contempt. I meant the other definition",0
"The secret service has already made it clear Trump can't be arrested the traditional way or put behind bars. He will remain in their custody. 

Traditionally a gag order violation would result in contempt of court which would put him in with Gen pop. Which again, isn't happening. So the Judge would be ordering the secret service to... place him under house arrest... maybe?  I'm not convinced the secret service think the judge has the right to order them to do that. I'm not even convinced he does",0
Trump doesn't live in NY anyway... so typically you aren't beholden to them anyway unless they work something out with your local state.,0

What happened to they were jamming it so the balloon couldn't collect any data?,0

-Loan the Taliban a whole bunch of expensive equipment in aforementioned botched withdrawal 

-Let Russia invade Ukraine and then form an alliance with our biggest adversary China

-Let China fly surveillance balloons across the entire continent when you were aware of its intentions well in advance 

-Totally cede control of the southern border to the cartels",0
"The balloon had a self-destruct mechanism that could have been activated remotely by China

   So, in other words.... China sent an explosive device into our territory. This admin is so weak and fearful of China this will go with no repercussions. Worse... This is a sign to China that this behavior is perfectly acceptable and will have no repercussions...",0

No shit Sherlock!   Why else did they deploy it....,0
"I know conservatives are upset about this story but counter espionage 101 is if you know your enemy is spying on you, you don't alert him to that, you let them see what you want them to see

It's a fucking balloon they had time to figure where it would be and stage areas.

"Funny how we didn't hear about the balloons for months, and all of the sudden we get dripped new info the day Trump goes to NY. The administration wants this story buried

While we're at it, how goes the Biden confidential documents roundup?",0
No shit huh?,0
The Biden team caught in yet another lie.  We are going to be speaking Mandarin in the next ten years if the Democrats keep selling us out like this.,0
Its a good thing biden stalled and hid it from everyone to make sure they got the job done completely.,0
Another great job by clueless Joe.,0
Folks the reason it was let across the country is the military wanted to study the signals that it was using. The whole time it was over the US it had the new U-2 variant over top of it and other data snoopers around it at all times. This was a windfall for us. They were no doubt looking at nuclear sites and bases. But we knew exactly were it was at all times so we just buttoned up and reduced emissions when they got close. There isn't much info the balloon could have collected that a satellite couldn't have. Now we on the other hand got to monitor in real-time the Chinese emissions and signals. We knew the exact time and location of all transmissions and what signals they sent at those times. The Chinese are going to have to change there ciphers and data collecting means now that we have a good idea how the operatate. If they don't them the are morons and opening themselvesup to exploitation. And in addition we got the parts after we shot it down. We are gonna have a good look at how they set up there electronics things like there EM collection and camera technology so we can exploit any design flaws. They should after this make big changes but who knows. I know we conservatives like to criticize anything the government or military is involved in but this is a rare we shouldn't. According to reports biden wanted to shoot it sown right away but the military convinced him otherwise. This was the pragmatic view.,0
What?! CNN said it was ‚Äúonly‚Äù a innocent weather balloon that blew off course!,0
"Hey, no shit.

It's getting so tiresome to say something and then watch the rest of the world (and especially the press) go from ""This isn't happening, and you're a lunatic for believing it.""

THIS‚Ä¶.is nothing short of treason. To allow a spy balloon to fly over the United States and its military bases reeks of collusion. Biden and his administration should be removed immediately before we all suffer dearly.,0

Wait...didn't it get unveiled that during the last president's time in office 3 of these balloons were caught to be flying around the United States as well?,0
the balloon saw nothing a satellite couldn't find. It was the right call to let it pass and recover it at sea. This criticism isn't real.,0
This is the third balloon that they have found flying in our nation in the past 10 years and neither Trump nor Biden did anything....the last 2 presidents have been horrendous. Please bring back people that care about the United States...,0
"How's it funny? It has excellent loiter on target capability to soak up sigint. Combine this with them laser range finding the waters around ssbn ports, its damn obvious they are establishing a baseline. A balloon is a relatively cost effective intel suite, probably a few hundred grand with what hardware they likey had on board.

They pulled off a master class victory: take advantage if pattern of incompetence of balloons floating over, steer this one to cause political mischief by monitoring or doing low level sigint over selected target to generate a physical and poitical response to see ""what happens."" They got everything they needed to know. Including how F22's would be utilized with minor info pickup during that encounter. Also, that politcal gamesmanship trumps all. Smarter play would have been to do like the preceeding times.  Watch, dont change behavior, or spoof and manipulate with bad data ... that would have been the better response than whatever spectacle happened.

We do the same, but with different packages.  Some areas we are better in and some we may not be.

China plays by *very* different rules and theory and has had the benefit of observing our parties turning military into a constituent benefits program.",0
"It's actually very very smart. They specifically wanted signals intel, particularly what is being send from our nuclear bases up to satellites - I'm sure most people know that China is fast developing anti-satellite weapons so they can take out US comms, GPS etc. if war breaks out.

Another satellite can't do that. 

 Flying a plane over US nuclear bases would get them shot down pretty quick, and also means they are only near a base for a few seconds.

A balloon is unlikely to be shot down (well, until recently anyway), moves slowly and at a good altitude for sig intel of this type, has better deniability etc.",0
"It does add up if you consider the mistaken bombings as a mixture of arrogance and incompetence.

Managing what someone sees is far harder in practice than it is in theory.",0
"The entire world knew our enemy was spying on us, and China knew that. You also just gave an example of how our military can make mistakes as an argument for why there's no way they made the wrong move here...",0
"It's much easier to sleep at night if you believe these statements. I'm honestly not so sure anymore, though. There does ""exist"" a possibility that we are not a VASTLY superior country with extremely capable and intelligent people in charge.",0
"Probably was.  The Chinese have hundreds of spy satellites that can read the writing on a dime.

"people are really, really underestimating the importance of this. Ending the petrodollar would have catastrophic results domestically.",0
"The balloon was a signals intelligence collection platform, those are things that satellites most definitely can‚Äôt ‚Äúsee‚Äù. They should have and could have shot it down as soon as discovered as there was very little risk in doing so.",0
"Because a balloon with a data-gathering device attached is primitive and it's not subtle. It's what a goblin from World of Warcraft would slap together. Every country spies on everybody else but they do it with things like computer viruses, drones, human agents, etc.

I don't really trust the government's claims about this balloon in the first place, but if it really was a ""spy balloon"" then the Chinese are even less advanced than we thought.",0
"I would caution that we conservatives are also guilty of negativity and falling into our own echochambers. China is a threat but its not as bad as many conservative talking heads argue. The Chinese are in just as bad if not worse then us. Their demographics are falling currently. They reversed the one child, two child, and three child policy but it has absolutely gutted their demographics. Urbanization is also contributing to the falling demographics as China is the fastest urbanizing country on earth. China also imports the vast majority of raw materials most importantly fuel and food. They are terrified of the losing those imports because they can't survive without those imports currently. There is more but you get my point. Yes we have extreme domestic issues and that is what I am most fearful of. We have the ability and means to be food and fuel independent and still have vast access to raw materials and one of the most skilled and efficient  work forces on earth but we restrict ourselves and tie our hands behind our back. We are self sabotaging and much of it is because of insane leftist domestic policies. Sorry for the long winded response but history, military, and geopolitics has been a love of mine since I was a boy. America is in rough spot but we should not fall into despair.",0
We're building back better!,0
"the US does it's signal collection all the way out at GEO.

low earth orbit CAN collect signal info in the same way a balloon can.

plus it's not like their signals can capture anything useful. It's all has military grade cryptography.

so no, shooting it was not the right call. I think I can trust our military (not biden) on their strategy. republicans are trying to use this as a way to hate biden but it's incredibly ignorant to actually believe that.",0
"Yet it managed to traverse the entire continental US, transmitting intel the entire time.  Sounds pretty effective to me.

Perhaps we should be staffing our intelligence and defense services with ""goblins""",0
"This thing was comically huge.  Slowly floating over the entire United stated with advanced surveillance equipment.  They probably expected it to be intercepted, or maybe they've been getting away with it for a while already.  Either way we let it happen.

Drones can't have that kind of payload.  Human spies certainly exist, and are known to sleep with members of congress, but they can't carry a ton of equipment and fly around looking for secret bases.  Idk what level of sophistication you're expecting, but this is the real world, and the sci-fi shit you're imagining doesn't exist.",0
No more mean tweets!!!!1!!!,0
"I‚Äôve got over 20years in SigInt, take that for what it‚Äôs worth. LEO and GEO sats aren‚Äôt on station long enough to provide the coverage mapping of a balloon doing figure 8‚Äôs over a specific target at balloon speed. The US does TONS of ground based collections because as collection goes, the closer you are to the xmit source the more complete you collection is going to be, ‚Äúheight makes might‚Äù in transmitting, it‚Äôs nearly the opposite for collection. Cryptography can be cracked, and not every comms device used by government, contractors or military is encrypted, especially the mundane day to day work. 

Never mind that the US tracked the balloon since it‚Äôs departure from Hainan and had the entire Pacific Ocean to prepare for a take down once it entered US airspace, offshore west coast. You know why I don‚Äôt trust the military? Because I‚Äôve served in it, seen some of the people that are retained and promoted within it (particularly officers), and watched them lie for decades. They also admitted, their goal was less about ‚Äúsafety‚Äù and moreso counterintel (the ability to recover more of the platform intact). We can certainly disagree about the value of whether that was the right call, I maintain it was not given they knew what it was not (a weather balloon) very early in its flight and not knowing it‚Äôs payload or capabilities, allowed it to traverse the continent AND broadcast its intelligence back to Beijing. That‚Äôs poor NatSec by every definition.",0

Just don't look too deep into DeSantis or you might be disappointed. Doesn't he support red flag laws? Seems like an odd thing to go after Trump for if you are pushing DeSantis. Given what Trump has gone through at this point and all the corruption he's experienced I'd expect him to be more receptive of arguments rooted in government mistrust.,0
"I'm not supporting anyone in particular at the moment, DeSantis may very well be the wrong guy for the job. I think the Republican party has a lot of sorting out to do before we find the right candidate, and Trump is the first person on the list of those being sorted out. He's gone through a lot, but he also has no commitment to civil liberties and free market principles. He brought in protectionism, gun control, and in many ways marched the party toward authoritarianism. Why did we tolerate that?",0
"I think that's a pretty big misrepresentation of what his position is.

I mean yes he brought in protectionism for example... but why did he do that? It was a means to an end of more free trade, not less. E.g. he imposed tariffs on Canada in order to try to get them to open the market on dairy. Likewise he wanted to pressure China to open up their markets. If anything, covid proved Trump's policy correct because it highlighted the problems with unfair trade regulations that distort the market and create a one-sided dependence without mutually assured destruction, which is also a national security and foreign influence issue.

Consider you already have a tax on people who play sports - let's say you charge them extra income tax. Trump comes along and imposes another tax on everyone else to make it even. But you then criticize him for distorting the marktet and being against ""free market"" principles. It's really based on an incorrect understanding on your part.

Another example would be the border - on the surface it seems like someone who supports ""civil liberties"" should support a more open border, but we have entitlements in this country that force citizens to pay for it... so it's actually LESS consistent with liberty to support open borders, unless you also combine that with massive entitlement reform (which there is no public support for). There are nuanced issues. Sometimes to maximize net freedom you have to restrict freedom. Anarchy - a society where people are allowed to infringe on the liberty of others for example - is ultimately one that is less free.

I find it odd you think anything from Trump himself has moved us toward authoritarianism. It's clear from his discussions that's not what he wants at all. So that's a really strange accusation, especially when you consider the alternatives to him...

I mean if he was like Obama wouldn't he have just shut down the Russia investigation from the start? Wouldn't he have gone after his political opponents with his DOJ? The IRS? Wouldn't he have surrounded himself with his own people instead of trying to work with others in the establishment, who he did not know?

It's not their place to decide how a business operates and will be an unethical overreach of power to try to shut it down or suggest that certain people are banned

Days of ‚Äúvengeance‚Äù (one of which was scheduled to occur the Saturday after the murderer opened fire on innocent children and adults alike)

The current day targeting of White Christian Conservatives focuses on race, religion, and political beliefs.   The fact that this group sometimes holds wealth or power is not unlike the complaints of past fascists who made statements to the effect of ‚Äúthey (whatever group you hate) are the cause of your problems because they control everything‚Äù

> ""I never thought when I started my public life that guns would be the number one killer of children in America,""

Well that's just blatantly false. No serious person actually believes that. The study they use to get that bullshit says it's the ""number one killer of adolescents"", which they then include 18 and 19 year olds who are gang members because they see 19 year old drug dealers as adolescents in order to get the results they want for the narrative they want to push. Conflating 19 year old MS13 members with 4 year olds in daycare is not a serious study. This is known. But then people like Joe Biden's writers just change ""adolescents"" to ""children"" and keep repeating the lie for low information voters, like yourself.

First, sure. They included 19 year olds, in their study of causes of deaths internationally. Then they ranked it.

https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/issue-brief/child-and-teen-firearm-mortality-in-the-u-s-and-peer-countries/

The first thing that jumps out here, is using the same age brackets (because countries outside of the US often consider anyone under 20 to be an adolescent), we see that no other country has firearms in the top 3 causes of death. If you're using the same numbers, why are we worse than everyone else?

The rest of my arguments are still sound. 

Following every previous school shooting in the last few years, Republican members of congress have called for both a ""return of god to the classroom"" and for teachers and staff to be armed. The comments that appear on this sub generally just say that these shootings only happen in gun free zones.

This was not a gun free zone. The staff was armed. The school was a Christian school, that the shooter had actually attended. 

The Republicans in congress said ""this would not happen"" if the teachers were armed, or god was in the classroom. This still happened. 

When can we be grown ups about this, and acknowledge that some people shouldn't have guns? 

Like, what about pedophiles? Should they be allowed to carry guns? Furries? Homeless people screaming ""I am God"" on the sidewalk? Unmedicated bipolar schizophrenics? 90 year old war vets with dimentia? We won't let them drive, but should we let them keep an AR15 in the nursing home?

That is the conversation that the rest of us are trying to have, because we already knew that bibles and armed lunch ladies don't stop school shootings.

If you don't want liberal kids or conservative kids shot in their classrooms, then you need to support changes that can actually make a difference. Because none of those armed teachers did shit.",0

"Left wing corporations, a very real thing that definitely exists. Sorry to inform you but there are no left wing corporations, these large companies are doing this whole ‚Äúwoke‚Äù thing because they are trying to make money by catering to a certain demographic.

"He pulled it because they didn‚Äôt pay for verification, which is completely justified from both sides. Misleading headline. No one dunked on anyone here.",0
Title is 80% true click bait. He called them propaganda but they only lost the blue check because they didn't pay and they are now required to pay to keep it,0
"Misleading. Elon didn't pull New York Times' checkmark. He ended legacy checkmarks for everyone, and NYT didn't pay for the verification.",0
So glad to hear that NY Times isn't a verified source anymore.,0
It's about time the media gets called out as being the propaganda arm of the democratic party instead of news bravo,0
"So. NYT didn't pay for Twitter blue, so he removed the checkmark? Is that really news?

Also, the pricing of Twitter blue seems a bit like Lucille Bluth in arrested development saying ""It's one banana Michael, how much could it cost? Ten dollars?""

Musk is funny. But he really is going to drive that company to the ground. Good riddance though.",0

Anecdotally, I work for a few companies that felt Twitter has gone downhill. They feel it's not worth the monthly price and will be focusing on other platforms instead.


It will be interesting to see how that plays out.",0
It‚Äôs because they refused to pay.,0
"Misleading title. NYT decided to not pay for the badge.

If Musk really started curating badges on his own whim, he'd be just on the same level as the twitter management before.",0
Ok. NYT didn't pay for the blue check mark. They can do what they want. This really doesn't affect my life in any meaningful way.,0
I mean they ARE just propaganda at this point,0
"You know, I'm gonna be honest, the way Elon is handling twitter is abysmal. Just as I don't want twitter to be the arbiter of truth, I don't want Twitter to be the arbiter of what is false either. Let the free press exist. We shouldn't be for censorship or delegitimization just because we disagree with someone. 

^(Besides that though, some of the backend stuff Elon is doing is stupid too. He acts as if paying for twitter blue is somehow gonna weed out the bots on the platform, and uses it as a pretense to take verifications away from legitimate people. Like yeah I know there are a bunch of people who didn't need to be verified, but is it really that hard to just leave their verification or at least make a different type of verification? Make verified identities a dark blue and twitter blue a light blue or something. They're things that if you pitched them to me I'd be able to tell you is a dumb idea. He's barely done anything right honestly. Twitter was always a good product, its just the users are stupid.)",0
Too little; too late.,0
This is not at all what happened. They pulled verified for everyone who isn‚Äôt paying.,0
A whole news article about not paying an 8 dollar subscription.,0
"The people too cheap to pay for verification are also the ones harping about everyone paying their ""fair share"" in taxes.",0
"Uh, isn't this against the concept of free speech?",0
"It just shows you how much more they are interested in propaganda then money.

Their entire reason for being on Twitter is to get people to click on their articles and not be able to read them without paying up. This is a horrible business decision for them.",0
"The New York Times has been lying for the last 100 years. They lied about Cuba, the Vietnam war, the holocaust, on and on.",0
NYT is straight trash,0
"Wow, Musk is taking on a dragon.  The New York Times is the Left‚Äôs ‚ÄúPravda.‚Äù",0
Even though the Liberals claim that they don't do Twitter anymore I know this drives them nuts,0
Where's the lie?,0
"Tbf he did announce that as of April 1, they would begin the process of phasing out all the existing legacy checkmarks so that eventually only Twitter Blue users will have blue checkmarks.

I go on Twitter regularly and I love this change. For anyone who doesn‚Äôt go on Twitter, there are now four different verified checkmarks:

1. Blue check: Anyone who pays for Twitter Blue AND passes the verification process will get a blue check. Contrary to popular opinion, it‚Äôs not enough to just buy a Twitter Blue subscription. You actually do need to pass a verification process and this can take up to 2 weeks if it‚Äôs your first time getting verified.

2. Legacy blue check: Visually the same as the blue check but they‚Äôre essentially leftovers from the old verification system that was specifically catered to promoting and honoring celebrities. These legacy checks are currently in the process of being removed from Twitter.

3. Gold check: You can register a business/company with Twitter and get a special business account that has a square-shaped PFP and a gold check. This is to establish that any tweets made by a gold check are representative of the company that‚Äôs attached to the account.

4. Gray check: Basically the same thing as the gold check but it‚Äôs for government organizations/officials. Similar to the gold check, it exists to establish that any tweets made by a gray check are representative of the government office or institution attached to the account.",0
"remember before Musk people mocked checkmarks anyway? they're just more of a joke now than they were before, yet the left makes such a big fucking deal about it because Musk lives rent free in their heads.",0
It was always propaganda.,0
"NYT corporation wants you to pay $25 per month to see their BIASED stories, but at the same time is too cheap to pay $7 per month for that blue checkmark",0
And so it begins.,0
I love this man,0
"Finally.

NYT needs to work on its credibility.",0
10/10 for nailing the landing,0
"Well, they did say they would not pay for it. Sounds like Elon is being petty for petty's sake.",0
"Elon has been a weirdo lately, but this redeems him. Very cool to just shit on them like that lol a lot of the stuff they write definitely sounds bias and written by an amateur.",0
"Meh, the only thing the ""verified check mark"" verifies anymore is that the account paid for the check mark.",0
Any organization that lied to us during COVID was enemy propaganda.,0
Because it is.,0
"I mean, he's not wrong lol. It's one of my dad's staple sources of 'news' and the shit he espoused during the pandemic that he ""read in the Times"" was disturbing as shit. They had him convinced essentially that nothing short of totalitarianism was really the only way to tackle COVID.",0
CNN should be today then?,0
Hahahaha,0
Good.,0
Its about time.,0
Next do the CBC please,0
So the New York Times picks on kids for the way they were brought up. That's how scumbags defend themselves.,0

He isn't wrong.,0
Happy cake day!,0
How is it misleading?  Other news organizations have not paid but have retained their verified status.,0
All it takes to be a verified account on Twitter is to pay $7.99 a month. Or is that not a thing anymore?,0
"They never truly were, just a bunch of clowns gave them a check and said they were respectable",0
"> NY Times isn't a verified source anymore.

As it stands I‚Äôm more apt to believe the National Enquirer‚Ä¶Bat Boy has never done me wrong.",0
It's straight up foreign interference in elections.,0
"Liberals understand the power of language and that simply stating things over and over again, gives it even more power. Conservatives need to take this back and use it against them.

‚ÄúPlease stop spreading misinformation about President Trump, that‚Äôs dangerous to democracy.‚Äù",0
Something's misleading about the title though... Are they actually getting called out or did they just let it lapse?,0
"Honestly, I'm at the point where I don't think there are any valid sources of news. And it makes me feel like that's exactly where they want us. 

Everything is fact checked and everything is disproven... Our little bubbles point to us and say look, We have the common sense and we know what's good. But everyone's doing that... We are not unique in our little bubbles. Anyone who tries to tell me to get mad at something.... I immediately don't trust them.  Who's remains at this point?",0

"A red question mark put on NYT's twitter or similar would be more appropriate I think.

It would denote enemy action.  ""Trust at your own risk.""",0
it's $1000 a month for companies.,0
It's just 'entertainment' if you have to pay.,0
"It's $1,000 a month for organizations.",0
"LOL we've been hearing that Twitter is about to collapse ever since Musk took over. Still there.

Anyway, the headline is misleading. The NYT let their blue checkmark lapse, he didn't take it.",0
Then Project Fear will have to find a new space to metastasize in its next incarnation.,0
So losing a blue check mark removes their content?,0
I worked with ad tracking for a company around 2020 and even then pintrist was driving more sales than twitter ads.,0
"Putting all politics aside, twitter has always felt like an absolute graveyard for ad sales - I can‚Äôt think of a single sponsored post that I didn‚Äôt either subconsciously ignore or recognize, spend a split second grumbling mentally about, and scroll past. 

Compare that to instagram - ‚Äúooh, another pair of nylon workout shorts WITH a phone pocket in the liner??‚Äù 

Twitter is a text based medium, I don‚Äôt think it really lends itself to sponsored content. 

Also, whenever I read up on twitter drama I have to remind myself that it‚Äôs the social media equivalent of the school paper in terms of user count. So much of this drama is really just infighting",0
"The thing is, companies wont stop posting on twitter, its too good for reaching their audience. Unless some even more heinous decisions get made along the way

What is actually happening is that noone wants to advertise on twitter anymore. Advertising is what drives income for all social media companies, and twitter wasnt profitable before musk bought it and drove away a significant part of their advertisers. Twitter wont fail as long as its owned by musk, but it also will continue to loose money until he either sells it, pulls the plug or somehow miraculously manages to right the ship, which isnt looking good at this point",0
All the content of NYT is locked behind a paywall. They do not produce anything usefull for the Twitter user.,0
"Lmao, ‚Äúother platforms‚Äù. Facebook is dead man walking, TikTok on the verge of being banned. Instagram? Yeah ok‚Ä¶ Reddit is a dumpster fire of censorship and adolescence. Twitter is *the* platform unless you‚Äôre hopelessly woke.",0
But what if they lose some content but gain others. And eventually they have all kinds of news. Not just fucking fake ass democrat news but also real news from real sources. Imagine a world where people see two sides of the stories and stop getting brain washed blue.,0
THE WALLS ARE CLOSING IN,0

"Read the article. I get the title makes it sound like Musk calling NYT propaganda and them loosing their verified status are connected. And that would be antithetical to free speech. But that's not what happened. 

They lost it because they chose not to pay for Twitter Blue. And Musk made an offhand tweet in the aftermath, referring to their stories as propaganda.",0
They didn‚Äôt chose to pay for the verification. They aren‚Äôt free anymore. A business or celebrity surely has enough money to keep their verified status.,0

It doesn‚Äôt matter what a company is worth unless you‚Äôre planning on selling it. What matters is cash flow which they have. If he holds on to twitter indefinitely he will make his money back and more.,0
"The reason twitter is worth half of what Musk payed for it (I will take your word for it) is fraud. A good portion of their accounts were bots. So twitter got a good portion of their ad revenue from Advertisers thinking they reached real people  that may become paying customers when in fact they only reached bots. 

In the long run honesty and truth is the best business policy as the NYT will soon find out.",0

"While I love your optimism, I don't know what I can do with you're personal feelings that Twitter, over an indefinite period of time, might be worth more than it was last year.

What I DO know is what Musk himself said about the here and now which doesn't line up with your sunshine and rainbows.

Also, if you think cash flow is what matters, you should scrutinise your numbers again because it doesn't look like there's a lot left after the large debt payments.",0

It's another thing to standby and allow full on offensives into a completely different country. If Russia is willing to make excuses for why they should be allowed to take over Ukraine, does anyone truly believe it would stop there? At what point does the ""don't involve ourselves in eastern European conflicts"" stop? Does it stop after Ukraine? Yeah, right. If you'll turn a blind eye to Ukraine, then you'll also turn a blind eye to Germany, and France, and every other European nation. Next thing you know, ""eastern Europe"" just becomes ""Europe"".

The war in Donbas started in 2014.  There‚Äôs also been a lot of passive aggressive stuff like building a dam to block water to chimera.

"Idk i took a political philosophy course in college as an elective and they were talking about how governments are basically the result of how shitty the state of nature is (which is basically anarchy). If you put people in a state of nature (no state) then they become tribes. The tribes are basically just mini governments/tiny countries, with their own rules. Problem is larger tribes go around taking the smaller tribes shit. So the tribes end up going into fuedal times. One of the big dogs essentially instead of stealing takes taxes from the small dogs in exchange for protection. In essence that is what a government is. Anarchists seem to be saying they will go back to a tribal state, problem is in my mind the tribal state is just making smaller governments.",0
I was with you until you got to the ideology part. When was the last time you had a semester in college?,0

Don't worry I'm not going to,0
"The counter i'd suppose (I'm not an anarchist) is that if you're free to join one (or more) of the new tribes you'd still be more free than you are now. No native born American had any choice in becoming American, and these new mini nations/ gangs/ communes/corporations/ whatever will inherently be weaker and less able to oppress than our current authoritarian republic",0

"Are they though? Biden himself hasn‚Äôt done anything that would be considered illegal. Has he done something Unethical, morally wrong, or otherwise in bad taste 1000% all politicians have.

For instance there is nothing in federal law saying a president cannot lie to the press or people. There is nothing illegal about putting a family member in a position of trust in the government. He could write a pardon for his Son murdering a federal law enforcement officer on federal property and it would not be illegal.

Only illegal thing presidents get involved in is lying to congress which is perjury. 

There are executive level regulations or orders about it, but those orders and regulations were created by the executive branch. According to the courts they can apparently be removed or ignored by the executive branch.

Idk why/how he thinks DeSantis would do anything as president though since that‚Äôs not his job.",0
"> Are they though? Biden himself hasn‚Äôt done anything that would be considered illegal.

You're missing the point. I'm sure there's some obscure state or federal felony he has committed. Give GOP prosecutors enough time and they can whip something up.

This is the danger of what Democrats are doing to Trump- their desire to get him at all costs is going to force the GOP to retaliate. While the GOP doesn't have control over DC nor Delaware where they have the easiest time prosecuting Democrats, there are certainly a lot of Democratic congresscritters in red states that would be on the receiving end of lawfare.",0

"> DeSantis is taking heat over past votes

*As well he should.* His career as a politician should be a total reflection on how he would perform in office and what policies he would push for. He hasn't had to deal with any flak in his current Governor position from Republicans because the Legislature there has given him softball Conservative bills that all he had to do was sign. It wouldn't be the same if he were President with a hostile Congress in D.C. DeSantis would either sidle up to the Establishment to get things accomplished so that he can appear successful, he would be weak and simply be a lame duck in the role like Biden is today, or he would push for Executive Orders that would serve the public.

We definitely don't want the first two options. And we already have the third in President Trump who I believe would handle the job much better because he knows what to expect and how the system works there already.

I have always been skeptical about DeSantis and his true motives long before Trump started talking about him. I would be more apt to look at DeSantis and consider voting for him if we didn't have Trump who is still eligible to be back in the White House. But as long as Trump is a possibility, then he is the only candidate that I will consider voting for because of his successes that he had when he was in there before, even with the Uniparty's dislike/hatred of him.",0
"When you officially announce, there are rules and guidelines to follow. DeSantis plans on running, but if he doesn't announce he's running, he can get away with more.

Trump announced he was running because he was informed that he may be shielded from legal action while campaigning. Which if you look back, the RNC gave him the ultimatum that he if announces a bid, then they wouldn't cover future legal costs. Whereas Trump is more concerned about the outcome of the legal troubles than having to pay. Something he's been good at not doing for decades. So he announced his bid.",0
Ok what bills did he vote for or against as a congressman that has you so skeptical?  Not to mention as Governor of Florida he has line item veto.  So if he has a long track record in congress and ability to remove anything he doesn‚Äôt like in any of the bills the Florida congress oassss.

I liked that the guy governed conservatively but to back him and call out others for not being sufficiently ‚Äòconservative‚Äô enough‚Ä¶ is silly. The former Dem expresses non conservative thoughts all the time. 

We also should embrace the fact that we‚Äôve become the big tent party in this country‚Ä¶ but some want to kick out whoever doesn‚Äôt exactly align with their beliefs‚Ä¶ well buddy, that‚Äôs how you lose elections.

Remember anything that happened when Trump was president he gets 100% credit for. Anything negative is just MSM propaganda.

Hardly. Compromises are par for the course in Finnish politics, and compromising with PS isn't somehow inherently more lucrative than compromising with SDP.

I would say that NCP+Finns would have an easier time agreeing on domestic issues, while NCP+SDP would have an easier time on foreign policy issues, but NCP+SDP without Keskusta would still mean they could consolidate welfare regions. Keskusta has demanded an unreasonable and inefficient amount of regions that no one really wanted and no economist thought was a good idea, though opinions on the whole reform (started under the previous agrarian/conservative Sipil√§ government) are rather negative among economists as far as I can tell.

Point being, NCP+SDP might be able to consolidate and cut spending possibly quite easily in some areas, though probably easier in other areas with PS and Keskusta.",0

I mean youre correct but I had more meant overall Europe. The countries that are in the same category as ours are all similar in this notion. In most developed countries the right-wing support and generally accept what in America is a tooth and claw battle. People in the average political right in other European countries wouldnt dare to run on a platform of removing universal healthcare or free college or unions or ‚Äúlivable wages‚Äù  because even their base support those notions and would throw a fit if the politicians tried removing them. Whereas here some politicians sole selling point is literally ‚ÄúI will fight for your right to pay 100s if not 1000s of dollars a month towards insurance you still better not need cause youll still be put in debt or paying for your 6 year degree 25 years later‚Äù and people legitimately are like ‚ÄúOmg thank you so much for fighting against socialized communist fascism as hard as you do we‚Äôll elect you for the next 40 years‚Äù,0

But that Steak Egg and Cheese Bagel mmmmmmm,0
"This is EXACTLY the answer.  They'll pay the ones they have actually working for them MORE (not just talking about their excessive number of locations either), but there will be far less people staffing those operations.  Human capital has become too expensive for a lot of businesses in America now.  Some can press on through price hikes, which we've seen, but this doesn't work well for a lot of businesses.  Their entire business models are based on ""value"".  They rely on VOLUME to make up for the profit per ticket.  When and if the volume drops, the business goes into the toilet.  

It's a battle of the only the strongest, as it should be.  Trouble is, so many businesses are propped up by cheap borrowing costs and underpaying labor for the past generation.  A hard reset is needed for the US economy, and it's medicine that no one wants to take or be a part of.",0
"To be fair, this is regarding **corporate jobs** and not restaurant employees. Having said that, I do feel that fast food as Americans have known it will be largely unrecognizable in the future due to rising costs across the board, including labor. 

I meet a former work colleague for lunch about once a month and we usually go to a Wendy‚Äôs nearby. My last stop there I think there were two menu item meals under $10. Also, due to labor shortages and high turnover for these low level jobs, the quality has never been more hit-or-miss and often takes much longer to prepare, so you‚Äôre paying more for a worse product.

How does fast food as a category survive when it‚Äôs no longer affordable, fast, or as well prepared as before? These corporate layoffs will just be the next wave of this new reality. I think fast casual restaurants will start to be the new normal and that traditional fast food chains who compete primarily on pricing will bite the dust.

EDIT: also, I‚Äôm originally from Pittsburgh, and the last McDonald‚Äôs located in the downtown footprint has or is about to shutter its doors, and locals on the sub-Reddit are cheering about it as if the largest global food chain and its affiliates deciding that your major city is no longer a viable spot to have a business is somehow progress and positive change.

Sometimes I gotta have a quarter pounder. and there‚Äôs a mickey dee‚Äôs very close to me.,0
"That really has been the tale of fast food transformation the past two decades. People will willingly pay a minor increase in price for a major increase in quality, particularly if costs keep escalating overall and make substitution choices even more viable.

The sub sandwich is a great case study. Jersey Mike‚Äôs and Jimmy John‚Äôs are eating Subway‚Äôs lunch‚Äîpun intended.

">The key insight here is that this move indicates that the US values Japan over Europe.

I gotta disagree. What this actually indicates is that in East Asia, unlike Europe, there are major industrialized countries which are not aliged with the West (read: China) and would be willing to buy up this oil and LNG if Japan/SK don't want it. (The supplies we're talking about here are produced in Russia's Far East.)

In Europe, there are no nearby alternative customers the Russian's could turn to. Instead, they now have to ship the oil and natural gas which were previously going a short distance to Europe (from oil and gas fields in the European parts of Russia!)  half-way around the globe to China or India, increasing the shipping and insurance costs and restricting the capacity.

So the key difference is that the West/the US/NATO have hegemony over all of Europe to the west of Belarus, while East Asia is geopolitically divided between our adversaries (China, NK) and our allies (Japan, SK).",0
Kind of disagree. The politicians in the US are catering  to climate activists and not acting with common sense. It is hurting both the US and the world.,0

Cap is a Gen Z thing.,0
Started with? That‚Äôs exactly what Ukraine is asking for,0
"They were given an exemption to buy $52 million dollars worth of oil over 2 months at around $70 per barrel because it was a byproduct of a natural gas contract that was already signed. It's literally nothing. Japan bought about $4.6 billion in natural gas in the contract year 2022, the oil is just something that is also produced alongside the natural gas, so they buy it as well. Japanese companies also own 22.5% of the company supplying both the LNG and oil, so there's certainly some lobbying there.",0

Germany being a kind of defacto leader of the EU, this would mean other countries would perhaps follow suit.  The attack on the pipeline basically ended this possibility. We also can't discount that the Swedish Navy claimed it spotted an underwater drone near the pipeline a short time before the attack.",0

"Trump was what we needed in 2016. Someone who was willing to call out all of the bullshit on the Left and wake people up a little. 2020 election chicanery aside though, that element of his platform isn't unique anymore and his baggage is significant, even if not entirely fair. DeSantis, at least in my opinion, combines Trump's attitude with a more principled conservative stance but drops most of what made Trump such an easy target. Plus, DeSantis wouldn't turn 80 while in office.

Will I vote for Trump if he's the Republican nominee for the general in 2024? Yes. But will I probably vote for DeSantis in the primary? Also yes.",0

We all either know or are these people. The ones who define their personality over being a Trump supporter. They feed off the energy of saying screw you to the Trump haters. They act rude to people and then call them snowflakes. They will deliver another term of Biden which should be unthinkable.",0
It‚Äôs not that people think he‚Äôs a better nominee it‚Äôs that Trump has made an emotional connection to people who feel the political class has betrayed them for generations.

Emotion is usually the reason people support their candidate.,0

I'll take cringe over carefully crafted bullshit delivered by an ivy league communications team. I don't like that he's supposed to be an expert at surrounding himself with the right people, but failed at that during his presidency.  

Like many people here, I'll vote against him in the primary and for him if he wins the primary.",0
The popular vote is irrelevant. New York City and Los Angeles ensure that a Republican will never win the popular vote again. It‚Äôs not just a Trump problem.,0
"I‚Äôm pro-DeSantis, but I think a big argument is that Trump has better odds in the rust belt, which republicans NEED to win to have the presidency. Trump is the only Republican in a few decades to win any of WI/MI/PA, and even in 2020 he was within a few % points of all 3 states. He has more appeal to that white working class rural base, which DeSantis may not really have 

Those WWC rust belt voters are usually more socially moderate and economically populist. So the fear is that someone like DeSantis who is strong again the anti-woke stuff won‚Äôt appeal to them as much, and he‚Äôs more of a traditional conservative on issues like trade while again protectionist Trump may be a better fit for that region 

Overall I still think there‚Äôs a lot of great arguments for desantis and against trump too, but from electoral math perspective we NEED to win at least one of WI/PA/MI to have a chance even if we secure GA/AZ/NV still. So I think the best argument for trump is he just has a special emotional connection with those rust belt voters which transcends normal policy debates or whatever, since emotion always motivates voters more anyway",0
"Trump may have lost the popular vote but no Republican in history has gotten 74 million votes. Bush 2 got 50 and 62 million, Bob Dole and HW got 39 million each, Reagan himself got 43 and 54 million. Even Obama, the DNC's favorite, only got 65 and 69 million. Trump was more popular than Barack Obama and let that set in.

Not only that, but people believe Trump did a good job, he only got 62 million votes in 2016, which went up to 74 million in 2020. Can DeSantis do that with Trump working against him? I doubt it.",0

"It seems to be that your premise is simply he can‚Äôt win the majority vote. Since we do not have a national popular vote - merely a number that media and the left like to tally from State vote totals - it‚Äôs difficult to know where to begin. That is, unless the purpose of this was simply to allow space to shit on Trump. 

I personally believe both are qualified and capable and would excel in different ways for different reasons. I struggle with Trump‚Äôs attacking of DeSantis as it leaves a bad taste in my mouth being so far out from primaries and DeSantis is not even an announced candidate. Not all, but many of the arguments against Trump can be boiled down to likability. In Trump we had a person, not just q candidate, who had a national recognition before running. It was mostly positive. To think that any other candidate - assuming one that is not of the McConnell wing - won‚Äôt be made to be as loathed and vilified as Trump is naive, in my opinion.

1. Some people are stuck in denial about 2020.

2. Some people believe that the 400-500 Trump signs in their town of 4,000 is an accurate representation of how the rest of the country feels.

3. Some people are obsessed with getting revenge for 2020 and not thinking clearly about the best option.

4. Some people believe Trump has a better shot than DeSantis of attracting blue collar workers in the northern Rust Belt (Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin‚Äîthe Republican basically HAS to win at least one of them to win the election, barring a very narrow path that includes Virginia).

I‚Äôm willing to at least listen to point #4, but even then we don‚Äôt have much data on DeSantis‚Äô appeal or lack of appeal to blue collar workers, and we know Trump brings out a LOT of anti-voters in those key states as well.

Personally I think DeSantis has a much better shot of winning back Arizona and Georgia than Trump does (the former Trump basically poisoned with his anti-McCain rhetoric, and the latter his anti-Kemp rhetoric isn‚Äôt helping). If DeSantis can just do better with suburban women (which I think he objectively should) he has a shot of grabbing at least one of those northern Rust Belt states and the election. That‚Äôs just my high level analysis/opinion, though.",0
"I don't believe any Republican can handle the national media aside from Trump. Definitely not in the style of DeSantis who chooses to ignore them. They will invent and create their own narratives.

"Because the coalition Trump brings in is unique to Trump. There are voters out there that voted Obama that flipped to Trump or voters that don't normally vote, vote for Trump and Trump alone. You don't gain 12 million new voters in one term by bringing the same base, you create a new coalition. Trump speaks plainly, he speaks straight to people. Is he brash? Yes, but he speaks to a lot of forgotten voters.  I'm not saying DeSantis can't eventually bring those types of voters in, but I think it would be a lot easier to do that by running in 2028 when he becomes more established to the nation and the baton gets passed. I just think he is making a grave mistake if he runs in 2024. Like I say all the time though, I will crawl through hellfire to vote for Trump or DeSantis.",0
We need younger candidates for the next election. It's going to be the most important election in our lifetime next year that will determine the fate of the nation. DeSantis should be the nominee.

Get all mules that try to cheat arrested and thrown in prison til 2031,0

He‚Äôs not going to win hearts and minds of Independents or non-Republicans that aren‚Äôt already polarized.

Plus, he‚Äôs not going to overcome the current system. I say this as someone who believes fraud played a major part in the Safest, Freest, Securest Election Ever ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, what‚Äôs changed since 2020 to plug up the holes? Georgia‚Äôs the only state of 6 that shored up their election integrity or dialed back mass mail-in ballots. Why should we expect different results with the same candidates competing in a system identical to that from 2020?",0
"No Republican will win the popular vote.  I don't think a Republican has done it since Reagan who won states that Republicans can't realistically win in today's political climate.  And it doesn't matter who the candidate is or their platform.  If there's an ""R"" next to their name they will lose too many states and cities to win the popular vote.  The cities carry too much of a dominating voting block.  That's why we have the electoral college system so cities can't run rough-shod over the rest of the country. Let's not forget that polls indicate potentially millions of voters would have changed their vote had the Hunter laptop story not been buried.

Regarding Trump's age, it is somewhat of a concern, but comparing his cognitive ability to Biden is laughable.  There were clear and obvious red flags with Biden's mental health from very early on in his campaign.  Trump has more energy than many people half his age.

To the main point of your post, I think Trump (and most people on the right) were woefully unprepared for the level of corruption in the non-political positions within government, particularly departments like the DOJ and State Dept.  And I think anyone stepping into that position will be similarly unprepared if they haven't personally faced it before.  I don't think anyone besides Trump (because of what he went through) could come into office with a full understanding of how harshly and radically these departments need to be treated.

DeSantis on the other hand will have the same exact mentality Trump did.  Things like firing the people who undermined him like Fauci, Rosenstein, Eric C., etc. are not easy to do for someone facing re-election.  Trump can go scorched earth on anyone undermining him without fear of re-election consequences.  After the numerous fiascos he went through he has a clear list of who's on his side and who isn't.

Aside from spending, Trump has a stellar track record from a policy perspective.  DeSantis is doing great on the state level, but Trump has a proven track record on the national level.

In no way would I be upset with DeSantis.  But I think if Trump were to roll over or primary voters chose someone else, it sets a dangerous precedent that if Democrats work hard enough to conjure up fake controversies and smear Republicans with fake crimes that they can sway our vote.  

Case in point that you cite Jan 6 when we now know there were numerous undercover LEO's in that crowd one of which was on tape inciting violence.  Even with incitement I am all for reasonable charges on anyone who engaged against police or damaged property.  But that doesn't mean that Trump did anything wrong there.  And I think it's foolish to let an event that looks more and more like a false flag by the day be used to sway your vote.  

**If we allow our votes to be swayed by propaganda and clandestine operations by intelligence agencies then we are inviting more russiagates, more Jan 6's, and more bogus impeachments**. 

Remember how Trump's popularity changed over time.  He was unpopular because of his antics, but as the media turned on him the primary voters turned to his side.  Then he was elected and Russiagate hit.  His approval numbers plunged.  But his approval rating slowly recovered because of policy and as truth came out about russiagate.  Then the impeachments and covid came and he lost approval ratings, but they rebounded by the election.

So it seems that he only lost approval ratings when completely manufactured stories came out.  Once the truth was revealed his approval ratings recovered.  Every time his approval ratings fell, he was eventually proven to be right and his ratings recovered. He lost approval ratings for being right. 

**Trump wasn't targeted for his personality.  People loved him when he was a Democrat.**   
 **They hated him for his policy.  If DeSantis turns out to be as much of a threat as Trump from a policy perspective, you can expect the exact same results from him**.",0

I guarantee they will run the same playbook smear campaign they did against Trump (and Kavanaugh) against whoever the GOP nominee is.

There's no guarantee that DeSantis will be as good at being president as he has been as a governor.   


Worse, right now if Trump wins the presidency, we get him as president AND we get to keep DeSantis as the governor of a monumentally important key swing state.

Biden got 81 million votes at a time when many states legalized ballot harvesting and mass mail out ballots.

Democrats are able to capitalize on getting people who don‚Äôt even know when Election Day is and just walked by ‚ÄúRepublican is a Nazi‚Äù poster to immediately turn in a ballot days and weeks before an election. The big red wave did hit in the midterms but it only hit in Florida where republicans showed up early in big numbers to vote. Unless people get this it doesn‚Äôt matter who the nominee is in 2024. The democrats hope it‚Äôs Trump because they can get a lot more miles out of their pumped up anger and fundraising.,0

The media will make ANY nomination into the next Trump, DeSantis included (and they already are with him!). So voting for DeSantis is placing one ‚Äòmedia punching bag‚Äô with another. IT MAKES NO SENSE.",0
"My only concern with DeSantis is he is moving back towards the old Republican mode where democrats say something / do something and no one fights back - kind of like what Romney did during that debate with Obama and Crowley knowingly pushed a false narrative to help Obama, only to later ""correct"" it when the debate was over.",0
Desantis is now backed by the Bush wing of the party. That's a huge red flag.,0
Because he is,0
Why not both? A Trump DeSantis ticket would be powerful.,0
A Republican presidential candidate can lose the popular vote by a huge margin nationally only by losing California.  Trump lost the popular vote in California alone by 5 million votes.  Trump lost the popular vote nationally by about 7 million votes.,0
It‚Äôs a very strange dynamic.  All of the attacks from the left some of which are fair and some not have created this situation where it seems Republicans reflexively support Trump.  This most recent story.  Republicans are rallying behind his paying off a porn star for having sex with her while his wife was home with their young child.  I get that this shouldn‚Äôt be a crime though why does being charged for it help Trump in the polls?  Would we not prefer someone without these sorts of moral issues?,0
"Y‚Äôall still in here pretending it matters who we run? As if we won‚Äôt just have another ‚Äúsafest and securest election of all time with no irregularities at all‚Äù? Dems will do their thing and it won‚Äôt matter if Trump or Desantis pulled in 100 million votes, Biden or whoever will magically get 110.",0
I'm not convinced that Biden had 81 million legit votes.,0
"DeSantis supporters are putting on such a petulant show, complete with DNC talking points, that I'm becoming reluctant to vote for DeSantis even if Trump isn't in the picture. They are definitely staining his brand.",0
"Well, judging by Trump's track record, he got done what he said he would get done.",0
A certain presidential candidate got rid of everything that linked him to homosexuality and that is something you can even compare to stormie. Another presidential candidate always cuts her loose ends to this day and you can‚Äôt compare it to anything Trump has done. He is a saint compared to the majority of current or former politicians.,0
Exactly this. Not to mention that ever since 2008 it seems like the general election has become a popularity contest as opposed to people actually voting on the candidates' policies. Trump is just too unlikable. I prefer both over Biden but lean more to DeSantis cuz I think he has the better shot of winning.,0
Well said.,0
"My stance exactly, thanks for sharing.",0
That sums it up pretty much exactly.,0
Well said. I 100% concur with this assessment,0
Bullshit on the Left and Right*,0
"I'd also point out that the ""Biden Coalition"" is 100% anti-Trump. As in it stands for nothing else. Remove Trump from the equation and his campaign is done for. I could actually see if Trump lost the primary or step down that Biden would suddenly disappear as the candidate. 

Biden spent the 2020 election hiding in a basement the entire time and won. Democrats would have elected a rock instead of Trump if that was their alternative. It's a movement based on hate. And yes, they can generate hate about any candidate (DeSantis would be next and is already under fire). But the moderates also hate Trump. I know countless apolitical types in the 2020 election that never voted and only voted so they wouldn't have to hear about Trump anymore.",0
"Agreed. But I'm a Virginian and so I figure the GOP nominee will be a done deal by the time I get to cast a primary ballot. So I don't argue about Trump vs. DeSantis. It's pointless. Waaaaaay above my pay grade.

I was really pissed about that in 2008. McCain. Barf.",0
"As others have pointed out, you‚Äôve read my mind and thoughts to a T.",0
One of the things I've heard said on a radio show I listen too. He said something that makes a ton of sense to me. He explained that if Trump were to also win the primary. That people that normally don't ever vote. Will vote once again. Because the hatred for Trump. I believe this to be true.,0
"I still maintain Trump would make a far better Secretary of State under DeSantis, but his ego wouldn't let him take the step down.",0
This,0
The baggage is the most important part. It's specifically because of the baggage that it has to be Trump.,0
This is really an excellent comment.,0
">Trump has made an emotional connection to people who feel the political class has betrayed them for generations

I can't agree more",0
"Unfortunately,  Trump has also alienated as many voters as he has connected with. It doesn't matter how good his policies were and how well the country was doing, many people were turned off by his bravado and name calling. Negative emotions are just as powerful as the emotional connections he created.",0
Add the recent shenanigans in New York. People are pissed. I think this is heating up to be a crazy primary. Followed by a nasty presidential run.,0
"They aren‚Äôt wrong. Trump, for all his faults, was (and is) unafraid to say something politically incorrect. A LOT of people like someone who doesn‚Äôt do ambiguous ‚Äúlawyer speak‚Äù when asked a question. Conservative candidates can use these tactics‚ÄîESPECIALLY when they have factual high ground. Speaking plainly scores big points.",0
"Exactly, any person who prefers Trump over DeSantis is not thinking about who can actually win an election, they are just dooming Republican candidates for the sake of their ideological conviction. They would rather see Dems in the White House for the next 40 years than support a more establishment candidate.

The fact is, a plurality in the US still identify as moderate and independents, and at this point in time, that group hates Trump, even more than they hate extreme liberalism, and they always will. The winner of the next election will be the candidate that is seen as less extreme, and that will not be Trump.",0
"Does balancing the budget include significant tax increases? It‚Äôs hasn‚Äôt been done without some tax increases..ever. 

I don‚Äôt think many of my fellow Republicans give a damn about a balanced budget, all they want is to cut spending where it doesn‚Äôt touch their billions in sacred cows.",0
"What, you want it delivered by a non-Ivy League communications team? Would that make you happier? Ok, bro. I‚Äôll try not to take it personally. :(",0
"They said that after the 2000 election. Then Bush won the popular vote in 2004. Blacks and Latino voters came out in bigger numbers for Republicans in the last 2 elections, showing a very dangerous trend for Democrats.

What changed to make it so Democrats still won? White women swung hard against Trump, hating him. Anti-Trump. 

If the GOP can stabilize those demographics a popular vote is fairly easy for a Republican. Even with mass mail in ballots in California padding the numbers. California Republicans also hated Trump. Polling in 2016 showed that even though Trump had the band wagon effect going, had the California primary still made a difference the state was going to overwhelming vote for Cruz to stop a Trump candidate. My brother in California (big conservative for his entire life) voted Independent in 2016/2020 as he would not vote for Trump.",0
"I think it‚Äôs possible but it‚Äôll take two things:

1. A Republican nominee not named Trump.

2. A Democratic nominee that is extremely awful (like, Maxine Waters level of awful‚Äîmaybe Kamala or an 82-year-old Biden fits the bill, I don‚Äôt know).

If Ted Cruz was the nominee in 2016 instead of Trump, he probably wins the popular vote. More than 5.5% of voters went third party that year.",0
"Trump has near zero odds in AZ and GA and very low odds in NC and NH. 

I also think MI and PA have completely turned on Trumpism. I mean PA literally elected brain dead socialist rather than the Trumpy candidate.",0
"DeSantis will bring in independents and Trump voters will vote for DeSantis over Biden anyway. Many swing voters refused to vote for trump because he is morally repugnant and not based on any policy issue. 


The funny part is talking with swing voters most had little to no idea Biden was a pedophile that sexually abused his daughter, that he used the secret service to cover for his sons crime, and the level of corruption the Biden crime family has committed. 


They watch CNN and to the best of their knowledge Biden is a respectable elder statesman and Trump is a dirty angry old man that bangs prostitutes and abuses women (which he is).",0
"This is the one pro-Trump argument I‚Äôve heard before and I‚Äôm willing to listen to, but I‚Äôm still not so sure I agree with it.

What‚Äôs to say DeSantis wouldn‚Äôt do well in any of the northern Rust Belt states? I get that the data with blue collar workers is minimal but Trump attracts a *ton* of anti-voters and did abysmally with suburban women; I think DeSantis should objectively do better in both categories. DeSantis also did so well in his re-election in Florida (won Miami-Dade by 11 points and Southeast Florida outright) that one has to think he can attract *some* moderate voters that Trump wouldn‚Äôt.

Also, isn‚Äôt Trump anti-woke, too? Dude literally said ‚Äúeverything woke turns to shit.‚Äù",0
"You‚Äôre forgetting arguably the biggest part of the equation: anti-votes.

Yes, Trump had the most votes ever for a Republican. He also had the most people vote *against* him than any other candidate ever. You think all,
or even most, of the 81 million people who voted for Biden did so because they liked Biden? Not a chance.

It‚Äôs debatable if DeSantis would get 74 million votes in a general election. But I can guarantee one thing: if DeSantis or basically anyone not named Trump is the Republican nominee, Biden sure as hell wouldn‚Äôt get 81 million votes again.",0
"Well, there are two problems with this. It's not how many votes you get, it's how many votes you get relative to the other guy.

No Republican has gotten 74 million votes, but no Republican has had an opponent getting 81 million votes either.\*

If Trump's 74 million votes makes him more popular than Obama, then Biden's 81 million votes makes him more popular than Obama too, and there's just no way in hell he is. Can't compare Reagan to Trump either because in the 1980s the US population was 68% what it was in 2020 -- adjusted for population, Reagan got the equivalent of 76-78 million votes in 1984.

\* I don't want to get into the whole ""election rigging"" discussion because assuming that it was rigged does us no favors; even if it was, what's the alternative? Stay home and not vote?

And also assuming 2020 was rigged, then let's use 2016 as the example where Trump won -- Clinton got 65 million votes to Trump's 62 million even though Trump won more states; does that mean Clinton was as popular as Obama in 2012? I really don't think so.",0
"IDK, I know many people that went to vote that are casually political vote for the first time, specifically against Trump. I think Trump's issue is that he is specifically a Pop culture icon. In the realm of pop culture, the left has so much strength. So if you have someone so much in pop culture, they can garner a movement against him. It became a cool thing to flip off Trump Tower, or vote specifically against Trump because it was a cultural thing.",0
"Yep. Primaries are a means to an end. If your nominee cannot win the general, then the primary has not served its purpose and we all might as well sit out and to continue the metaphor being thrown around in recent days, put a ham sandwich forward and save on billions of dollars in election funds that would be otherwise wasted. 

It doesn‚Äôt matter if Trump is voted in by 90% of the Republicans if he can‚Äôt get control of the White House and get any meaningful legislation passed. This isn‚Äôt an opportunity to say ‚Äúoh well I like Trump so much it doesn‚Äôt matter if he loses‚Äù but should really serve as a reflection point as to why the Republican Party preferred candidate is anathema to the rest of the country.",0
"I used to judge both of them based on their policies. What I realize now that is that more than a strategic policy maker, we need a conservative warrior. This is obvious from the Trump indictment. Trump is the original warrior and he gives zero fucks for the establishment. For example, he started his election campaign at Waco. lol. He is the ideological leader of the conservatives and I prefer him over anyone else.",0
"Democrats will hate whatever candidate we put forward. But they have already won the narrative game against Trump. Moderates by and large hate Trump and went out to vote to ensure he wouldn't be president again. He also has the Establishment GOP hating him, allowing him to hang out to dry while Democrats lied and cheated via impeachments and January 6th. He also has the DC bureaucracy that hates him with a passion, and are going out of their way to sabotage him every chance they can. Even the brass in the DoD turned against him as he scared them about pulling out of NATO, so they want him gone.

You have every elite institution and entity stacked against him. Pfizer literally sat on their vaccine until after the election to help ensure Trump would lose. You couldn't be anymore obvious that there was a cross the board effort from Social media companies to the FBI that they were willing to do just about anything to see him not be president.

If that type of vitriolic reaction is going to happen for every GOP president going forward, yes we are truly screwed. But I think Trump kicked the hornet's nest a bit more than you are giving him credit for. And as it stands, the powers that be are not going to allow him to win again. Yes that is screwed up, but that is the reality of the situation. He has united numerous power factions to oppose him. He was also incredibly ineffective at fighting them.",0
"I don't get too worried about them attacking each other in primaries anymore. Kamala called Biden a rapist in the primary and then she ended up VP lol.  

It's all theater anyways",0
"Have you seen a single press conference with DeSantis? He handles the media just fine. Sometimes even better than Trump does.

Trump usually just says ‚Äúno no wrong wrong you‚Äôre wrong. Next question.‚Äù

DeSantis usually says ‚Äúno you‚Äôre wrong. And here‚Äôs WHY you‚Äôre wrong. And here‚Äôs why you‚Äôre going to BE wrong when you report on it tonight.‚Äù

This distinction alone makes DeSantis a way more attractive candidate to me. We badly need a Republican who has a spine with the media but also knows how to properly maintain that spine.",0
"DeSantis has not ignored the media. He just doesn't rant about it and name call. Just a few weeks ago he announced he would no longer do interviews with a major network because they out and out lied about his stance on a particular issue. The networked rolled out a half ass apology for their slander, but didn't fully correct themselves.

Trump was successful at tanking trust in MSM. Their polling is nearly as bad as congress due to his war with them. The trick is rising above that to the point it is clear the GOP candidate is above their mudslinging. Call them out for the slander while being presidential. This will appeal to moderates who very much care about appearances.",0
"> I don't believe any Republican can handle the national media aside from Trump

It's more than that. Anyone who runs from this point on, better have tens of millions for all the lawsuits the democrats will toss at them. We're talking dozens of concurrent lawsuits AND democrats will pressure any good law firm from representing him, so they get garbage representation. 

I like that Desantis isn't someone who got wealthy while in public office, but that also seems to be a gaping hole in his defenses.",0
"Florida was very strict on election integrity. Do you know why Miami flipped red in the past election cycle why is that? Because Florida has strict laws on voter ID, they have an election police force which arrests people for committing voter fraud so they have very strict penalties for voter fraud. That's why. Every Republican trifecta state needs to enact those same laws.",0
"Bush did it in 2004. That‚Äôs the only time since 1988 it‚Äôs happened though.

The Democrat is basically a shoe-in to win California and New York by a combined 7 million plus votes even if they run a half-eaten slice of bologna as the nominee, so I agree it‚Äôll be a long while before a Republican wins the popular vote again. Fortunately it‚Äôs clearly not needed to win an election though.",0
"Yes, it‚Äôs not about their popularity in Florida or even nationally, it‚Äôs about their popularity in Georgia, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan.",0
"DeSantis didn‚Äôt just get re-elected in Florida. He won re-election by 19 points against a candidate that was only 1 point away from the Governor‚Äôs mansion 8 years prior.

He won Miami-Dade county by 11 points and won Southeast Florida (Miami-Dade + Broward + Palm Beach) outright, which is bonkers for a Republican. Southeast Florida is usually a 20-point D safe zone.

He won Hispanics by 15, and Independents by 8. He got 45% of the moderate vote which is insane for a Republican.

You don‚Äôt do any of that without appealing to *some* moderate voters. Which is the key to winning swing states.",0
"> time is running out to prove it

The primary season hasn't even started yet. Only people trying to make names for themselves start campaigning this early (Trump being the exception to this rule). These type of arguments of ""running out of time"" are non-sense as in 2016 Scott Walker was the obvious leading candidate at this point in the election cycle. This will not get serious until the summer.",0
"Attacking the Iraq war just makes him enemies within the Republican Party and in the Establishment in DC. Peoples entire careers were based on that conflict, whether you liked it or not. Taking dumps on the war is a good way to make enemies with no real benefit. 

If you want him to address his position on interventionism. He has stated recently he thinks Ukraine (the current issue) needs to be resolved and peace be brought to the table. Similar enough position to Trump. Which is not in line with the Warhawks in the party that want to use Ukraine to bleed Russia dry.",0
His turn?  Sounds like the BS thr Clintons spouted,0
"Forever living in denial about the 2020 election is just going to result in Democratic Party wins in perpetuity.

Why is it hard to accept that Trump was simply unpopular to 55% of America? A night or two of watching the MSM or looking at the top stories on Google should‚Äôve made that obvious. A couple windows with cardboard covers is not proof that anything illegal happened. At most, some rules were bent. But ultimately Trump is just too polarizing to ever win again. 2016 was lightning in a bottle and‚Äîregardless of whether or not it‚Äôs his fault‚Äîhis baggage has only gotten ten times heavier since.",0
I don‚Äôt like Trump. Personally I think he‚Äôs a prick and absolutely do not want him as President. But I support the Conservative Party more than I despise him. The problem is that I cannot see a correct route that Trump can take that will equal winning in 2024. The guy produces way too many anti-votes regardless of how they won in 2020.,0
"Interesting, thanks for sharing",0
"Okay let‚Äôs say 2020 was stolen. Why wouldn‚Äôt they just steal it from Trump again in 2024 then? Why would you just re-run the same matchup?

Trump isn‚Äôt gonna fight the deep state he literally appointed the FBI director Wray who has been a disaster. Trump had 4 years and the deep state got the better of him the whole time, he couldn‚Äôt even fight back against Mueller. DeSantis wasn‚Äôt in the senate either.

"It‚Äôs still important to talk about it. The more Iowans and South Carolinians who understand, the better.",0

"It takes significant cuts. More specifically it would take entitlement reform. Which seems to be a sacred cow that not even Republicans will touch. Any conservative that talks about a balanced budget has to admit the Mandatory Spending would need to be throttled. They would also have to admit that the majority of the electorate will throw a hissy fit about it and Democrats will run ads of them pushing Grandma's off cliffs.

I'm sorry to break it to conservatives that think the deficit is the most important issue. Americans by and large don't care and will react negatively to any serious effort to address it. There isn't enough responsibility among the general population and you can see it among our culture (most Americans live way outside their means).

Tax increases do not fix it. Laffer curve and global economy. People are tapped out, there is no excess money floating around and our economy is almost in a stagflation. You increase taxes, you watch as economic growth stops completely or goes in reverse, and revenue streams from the government also go in reverse.",0
The Bush tax cuts effectively got there by 2005/2006/2007 when the deficit was so low it was effectively zero.,0

"Just like 2020 was an outlier of a year for politics due to Covid, 2004 was an outlier of an election because of what happened on September 11th, 2001 in New York. The U.S. was still a fairly united country at that time. So, it is absolutely no surprise that the President at that time would receive the popular vote.

As someone who did vote for Bush at the time, today I certainly regret how blindly I was in casting my vote for him. I am sure he was better than John Kerry, but not by much.",0
"No...they came out for Trump...not the GOP.  Most people think of the GOP as a party full of McConnell's and Lindsey Grahams...and they're not wrong. 

Trump is an outsider, just like journalist Matt Taibbi.  He showed them for the corrupt people they really are and now they want to shut him down along with people like Taibbi (a liberal), Bari Weiss, Lee Fang, and authors Michael Shellenberger, David Zweig and Alex Berenson.  The establishment in Washington doesn't like the boat being rocked, and the defense contractor lobbyists along with Wall Street are the ones calling the shots and they hated Trump because he was a wild card.  

&#x200B;

I'm for Trump again, I was on the fence and like DeSantis and will vote for him if Trump is out.  DeSantis has his own issues that will come out soon enough and I don't think he's a real outsider.",0
"I think that‚Äôs overstating it. He lost AZ and GA by 12,000 votes or 0.2-0.3% in 2020, they were razor tight, I don‚Äôt see how that means ‚Äúnear 0 odds‚Äù. Those states are drifting left and will be a challenge, but definitely not impossible. NH is def out of the picture, but he won NC by 75k votes in 2020, and his candidate won NC in the midterms too

The Midwest is interesting. Republicans COLLAPSED in the midterms in 2022 (and 2018) in the Midwest, and largely in the rural areas which just didn‚Äôt turn out. If you look at a county-level swing map, even a super trumpy candidate like Doug Mastriano who was a disaster and sucked did far worse relative to trump in the rurals rather than the suburbs surprisingly enough. The argument here from Trump people would be that his base are WWC rural voters who only show up in presidential years, that a ton of these voters ONLY show up when trump‚Äôs name is on the top of the ticket basically.",0

(Nothing will explode the deficit like higher interest rates on refinancing outstanding debt and mandatory inflation increases in Social security and other programs.)

Every one wants to use stimulus in the form of tax cuts or more government spending in a recessionary environment, but no one wants to do the opposite when the economy needs to slow down due to inflationary pressures. They let the Fed do the dirty work because the Fed doesn‚Äôt have to run for reelection.

Taxes equal to the dividend  tax on stock buybacks and large mergers and acquisitions would be a place to start, but there are many areas where tax policy can actually benefit the overall economy by driving new investments.",0
Elections are always about lesser evils. Bush ran on being a moderate pro-business president. He didn't plan for 9/11 and was manipulated by Cheney and neo-conservatives to do what he did.

The media reports it with spin, then people hear it and hate Trump on an emotional level. I do not think DeSantis will make the same mistakes. While the media does try to spin DeSantis in the way they do with Trump, it will be (and so far is) less effective. The media did the same with previous republican candidates, but no one has driven out the hate vote more than Trump.",0
"You‚Äôre not wrong, but Trump was something different. You had tens of millions of people who didn‚Äôt even care about politics dreaming, sleeping, and living 24/7 about beating Trump. You‚Äôre not going to get to that same level of hate with DeSantis in just 1.5 years. There will be *some* hatred, yes. That I (and all DeSantis supporters, I can assure you) are very well-aware of that. The point is it takes years of widespread national attention to get to the level of anti-voters Trump achieved.",0
"Laffer curve suggests that as you approach 100% taxation that revenue goes to 0. That each increase in taxes has diminishing returns, where there comes a point where you go over the bell curve and start heading back down again.

Our economy is on the brink. And between regulations, taxation, inflation, etc there is no way increases in taxes will result in more revenue. There might be a spike for 6 months then a sudden collapse.

>We should be using this period of inflation to both cut spending and increase taxes while maintaining low interest rates and reducing our debt growth. (Nothing will explode the deficit like higher interest rates on refinancing outstanding debt and mandatory inflation increases in Social security and other programs.)

You want to reduce interest rates with inflation going out of control? You typically want to do your type of measures doing good economic times. At least the Keynesians claimed that.

I don't see tax increases as ever a solution. You would need to get the states to reduce their taxes and get other economic impacts under control or you're looking at a full blown recession bordering on a depression.",0

When taxation laws allow corporations and individuals have a unnatural focus on tax avoidance vs wealth or sales/ income growth then the laws allowing the avoidance needs to be addressed.

"\>How did Dewine do? In pretty much every single election the Trump candidate underperformed normal republicans

Dewine did great but governors races are much less polarized than senate races, way more prone to blowouts. And again, who cares how much you win by if it's already a safe seat. DeWine was a disastrous governor on COVID, I much prefer a very conservative candidate like Vance to win by 6% in a Republican seat than a moderate win by a landslide in a seat that Republicans were always gonna win anyway. A win is a win, and 6% is more than a comfortable enough margin anyway, you don't gain much of anything by going past that. Vance was also running against a great Dem candidate in Tim Ryan, DeWine ran against nobody it wasn't a real campaign.

\>All of this happening in the best mid-term environment for the GOP since 1994. Those loses should have been lay-up victories. Not close loses.  
\>They are not lost for forever. However, we have 3 straight elections of them rejecting Trumpism, and when available accepting/embracing normal Republicans.  


I don't disagree, again I'm a DeSantis guy lmao. I'm just saying it's definitely very possible for Trump to win those states that he narrowly lost by, it's not an impossible task. In your original comment you said he basically had 0 chance in these states which I disagree with. I don't think he's the best option but I also don't think a 10,000-20,000 vote loss in some of these key states is impossible to flip.

\>Bush did pretty good. Trump has also cost the GOP the suburbs which will hurt long term in the growing areas of the country.  
Suburbs have been shifting democrat long before Trump, he definitely accelerated the trend but you can't pull Bush/Romney suburb margins when the suburns today are significantly less white and more college educated, two demographics that heavily favor dems. Look at the Atlanta or Virginia suburbs for example, Kemp/Youngkin's #s there despite being excellent candidates were still worse than the Bush days.

Also for Bush and the original question, despite winning 2 elections he never one one of those PA/WI/MI rust belt states which Republicans need in 2024 given how the map has shifted. He came very close in WI tbf, but again Trump is the first Republican since HW in 1988 to win any of those 3 states.  


\>If that is the case, then why did we win the house in 2022 but not 2020? Election after election since 2016 shows that Trump does more for Democrats than he does for the GOP.  
Again, I was talking about the Midwest in that comment, the white working class rural areas that are Trump's base. If you just look at the Midwest in 2018 and 2022, the House and Senate races are complete disasters because the rural voters simply didn't show up. And that'll be the question for DeSantis, can he turn out those low-propensity voters that Republicans need to win those states?",0
">Dewine did great but governors races are much less polarized than senate races, way more prone to blowouts. And again, who cares how much you win by if it's already a safe seat.

I don't think Vance wins without Dewine personally.  Also Vance is more populist than Conservative.

>I'm just saying it's definitely very possible for Trump to win those states that he narrowly lost by, it's not an impossible task. In your original comment you said he basically had 0 chance in these states which I disagree with

2022 gives us more evidence.  The only chance Trump has in those states is a completely collapse of Biden that makes those states meaningless anyways.  

> Suburbs have been shifting democrat long before Trump, he definitely accelerated the trend but you can't pull Bush/Romney suburb margins when the suburns today are significantly less white and more college educated, two demographics that heavily favor dems

Historically college educated was the core GOP Demographic.  The upper middle class bachelors degree family were the most reliable GOP voters.

They were disasters only in places where Trumpy candidates were nominated.  We walk in AZ for both Governor and Senate if normal people are nominated.  We walk in Georgia if a normal conservative is nominated instead of Walker.  PA should have been a lay-up in the Senate if we didn't nominate the worst possible candidate for both of those races.",0

You have to look at their goals.  You know what they want.  How does this feed it?

My view is this is about creating a crisis.  People who are being preyed on constantly and don‚Äôt feel safe will want the government to do something.  Take away some more freedom for protection.  Another chunk of 2A gone. 

But fighting back yourself undermines this.  So they want to discourage people from doing it by prosecuting them.  Even if they don‚Äôt get a conviction, the point is to ruin them one way or another as a warning to anyone else thinking of doing likewise.

Other theories that fit their goals and the facts might be valid.  Occam‚Äôs Razor applies.

The bigger question is why do they need to get rid of the 2A.  The CCP Virus lockdowns in other disarmed Western countries should have given you some idea.

Comparing it to the left's strategy against the police, well, how did that go for the left? Might want to think about that one. Hasn't that backfired on them?",0
Good. Prosecutors and by extension judges should be completely and utterly impartial. Leave your politics at the door and do your job according to the letter and the spirit of the law.,0
"Incorrect judgment in a case, like when someone is charged and the DA loses the case in court, it's not the issue. The real issue is malicious prosecution by a DA and abuse of prosecutorial discretion AND not periodically reviewing their track record for abuse and bias.

There is no mechanism to have their decisions reviewed for how they arrived at the decision to charge in the first place and what led up to that.

I believe qualified immunity is necessary.  But I also think people are missing the point of the term. It should be ""qualified.""

In the case of the police, I used to think that qualified immunity should not be taken away because without it, it inhibits the way they go about their job. Without it, it can negatively influence how they do their job. 

But at the same time, qualified immunity needs proper and aggressive oversight because as we've seen many times in recent years, it can easily be abused and it's use can easily be rationalized. This is what has been coming to the surface and we've been finding out recently. There is a great lack of proper oversight that must accompany
qualified immunity for it to be effective.

So now I'm all for, in the name of balanced justice, figuring out in great detail exactly when qualified immunity should not exist or when it should be taken away in cases, even temporarily.  And maybe this is a case-by-case thing until a cop or a DA shows a track record of misuse and bad judgment?  Then I'm all for having it removed 100% for them permanently.

I'm NAL, so I don't have nearly the informational background needed to even begin to solve this problem.  There may also be other possible solutions that I'm completely unaware of like some kind of renewable insurance or bond or accreditation that needs to be put in place when police and DA's are given their authority?

But I also recognize that doing so after the fact could put a lot of cops and DAs in jeopardy for judgment they used. Removal of qualified immunity, even temporarily on individual cases, must be done with lots of advanced notice and training as well.",0
"Good, end Qualified Immunity all together, it is an abomination created by the Supreme Court that we survived without for over 206 years. After 41 years it can go in the trash were it belongs.",0
"I watch Steve Lehto on youtube. He often does videos on the absurdity of qualified immunity. To have QA removed, there has to be a similar case where QA was struck out. But you can't have QA struck out if there is no similar case. It is completely bloody bananas.",0
The supreme court we have is unlikely to go for that proposal.,0
"Which is why it needs to be done legislatively, they can go kick rocks on this issue for all I care.",0
Now... if we turned around and increased production to compensate we could spit in their faces and make some fucking money while reducing energy costs at home... but that's too damn smart for the absolute fucking morons we got running this sideshow.,0
Not surprised. If we utilized our own oil we could pay down the debt and make this country a better country and then use that opportunity to combat ‚Äúclimate change‚Äù or utilize cleaner energy.,0
">f we turned around and increased production to compensate we could spit in their faces and make some fucking money while reducing energy costs at home

The global oil market is complex, and increasing U.S. oil production might not directly lead to lower energy costs at home. Prices are influenced by numerous factors, including geopolitical events, economic conditions, and technological advances.

Increasing oil production in the U.S. can also have significant environmental consequences that contribute to climate change. Moreover, there are risks associated with oil spills and damage to ecosystems.  Oil spills can lead to increased taxes due to the expenses related to cleanup, environmental restoration, and economic losses. Governments may need to allocate additional funds for cleaning up spills, rehabilitating ecosystems, and compensating affected industries like tourism and fisheries. These expenses can result in increased taxes or shifts in budget priorities.",0
"Don‚Äôt kid yourself on paying down the debt. Neither party is willing to be fiscally responsible now, not when being irresponsible allows them to line their own pockets.",0
"Listen... I know how oil prices work, simple supply/demand. I don't need a basic econ course.

And I *don't fucking care* about ""environmental consequences"" when I have to pay through the nose just to drive my car to work.

We had fuel prices, pre-plandemic, below $2/gallon while being a net exporter of crude. We could *easily* do that again... if we had someone at the helm that was actually *voted* into office... not installed as a fucking puppet.",0
Complete BS.,0
"What a short sighted view. The world has energy needs. The energy needs will be met somehow. At least when we produce in the US, companies are held to strict environmental regulations that minimize impact to the environment. When that production is done in places that don't have strict environmental regulations instead, the amount of pollution is astronomical comparatively. And saying ""But that doesn't affect us because the pollution is not being generated by us"" is ignorant. If you truly cared about the environment, you'd want the US to increase local regulated production so we decrease the dirty unregulated production being done elsewhere in the world. Something to think about.",0
except everytime we have significantly increased production prices have gone done.  law of supply and demand.,0

"I honestly don't get how this isn't already a thing, especially in a right leaning state. My local schools have had armed resource officers since Columbine happened. They have their own little office inside the main office. Once the tardy bell rings, all doors to the school are completely locked. The only way in is a separate door(installed after Columbine), where there is a security camera that goes to the main office, you buzz your way in and go directly to the main office.",0

I went to HS in Detroit in the 90s. Metal detector at the main entrance, armed school cop always there - and, this was at one of the ""good"" schools. You know what didn't happen?

"Or crazy idea here, maybe less security is better. I never had any of this bullshit growing up. Nobody shot up my schools. No metal detectors, no locked doors, no security , no oversight, no fucking police state in a school which is what these damned schools are. They are mini police states. No wonder we are getting authoritarianism in the USA. Did you know kids now have to wear an ID at all times at school? They get in trouble if they don't have it. I never had an ID. Never needed one either. It's a joke, we're teaching kids that authority should be monitoring them at all times. No wonder they all have anxiety, big brother is always watching",0
"Wasn't the school in TN a private school? This will be great for public schools, but private schools need to do the same...

It is also my understanding that the shooter entered through a door that was supposed to be locked, but wasn't.

"We had a cop on campus and the ID requirement, but that was about it, the doors weren‚Äôt even locked if I recall correctly.  

Even the ID thing wasn‚Äôt heavily enforced, and mostly used when checking out a book at the library or when going off campus for lunch which you could only do if you were a Senior.  We could leave the ID in our wallet.  It was a decent security measure though, because of gangs they had a few incidents where someone who wasn‚Äôt a student came on campus to sell drugs, or to start a fight with a rival gang member.  The ID ended up stopping this.

The cop was just there.  He wasn‚Äôt even allowed to get involved in situations that fell under school discipline.  He only got involved if there were drugs or weapons, or to help break up a fight.  He was armed, but that‚Äôs because he was a cop.",0

"Also, In the final two free elections before Hitler‚Äôs rise to power, in July and November 1932, the Nazis received 38% and 33% of the vote, respectively ‚Äî a plurality but not enough to bring them into government. In the 1932 presidential election, Hitler lost to Hindenburg by a wide margin.

Hitler came to power not through elections, but because Hindenburg and the circle around Hindenburg ultimately decided to appoint him chancellor in January 1933. This was the result of backroom dealing and power politics, not any kind of popular vote. It is true that after Hitler was already ensconced as chancellor, the Nazis subsequently won the March 1933 elections. But this was in the wake of the Reichstag fire, when the government had passed an emergency law that sharply restricted the activities of left-of-center parties (including the arrest of many Communist leaders). Thus it is difficult to claim that these were ‚Äúfree and fair‚Äù elections.

Sorry but that's not true. That's not how iOS or Android operating systems work. Each app is separated by design.,0

It‚Äôs particularly high among conservative Republicans (70%) and less so among moderate or liberal Republicans (46%). Among Democrats, conservatives and moderates are more supportive of a ban than liberals (49% vs. 36%).""

"Simple solution. Don't ban it outright. Ban them from requiring names, phone numbers, addresses or any other personal information or accessing unnecessary priveleges/data from u.s. consumers.

"Liberal Arts major, eh?",0
"Social media is speech and protected by 1A. Congress has no right to ban a particular service because they don't like what is on it.

"By ensuring that only white male landownerd could vote at the time restricted voting to people who were the most educated, because they had the **means** to be educated. 

I don‚Äôt think having some sort of literacy criteria is out of bounds given that we publicly provided education today. 

If you wanted to gripe about the state of the education system I would agree, and I have two suggestions on how to improve it. 

1. Prioritize curriculum which trains students‚Äô *critical thinking skills* Conservativism isn‚Äôt about rejecting science or expertise because to do so would mean rejecting the very skills and knowledge thst not only drives innovation in the free market, but which is responsible for the progression of Man from the horse and carriage to the aero plane. We don‚Äôt hold onto the traditions of American Ideals and the proven ways because *they are old* but because *they are true*. Our task then is to work to understand how modern technologies fit within the Constitutional Framework balancing necessary government authority with the duty of government to maximize our liberty. 

2. Institute a civics curriculum which not only teaches the Constitution in an **Originalist** manner in order to understand the document, also teach natural rights philosophy which is the school of thought  which had a massive influence on our Founding Documents. And also teach that our rights and freedoms are predicated on our execution of our civil duties. 

For example: everyone in our country appreciates their rights to a lawyer and a *trial by a jury of their peers*, but for us to have the right it is our *duty* to serve others on Juries. In other words to enjoy our rights we have duties and responsibilities to uphold. 

The Constitution is the law of the land and I‚Äôm willing to bet most Americans don‚Äôt know what their rights are beyond the 1st, 2nd, and 5th Amendments. And anyone who claims the Constitution is a ‚Äúliving document‚Äù is not only delusional about how documents work but is in effect saying we are a nation ruled by men not laws. No thank you. 


In short I say: Bring Back the Party of Goldwater!",0

I do agree an informed opinion is incredibly important, and that begins with a good education.",0
"The question of what I would do if the majority of the US decided to strip me of all my possessions and lock me up? yes, if that imaginary situation happened, I think I would attempt to defy the will of the majority.

"I believe in the system we have in place in which we elect officials to do the will of the people. And if that system is functioning properly the will of the people is done.

However, it requires a constitution/bill of rights that sits above all the other laws and a judicial branch, like we have, to ensure laws are in line with that constitution. Some rights, like self defense, property ownership, or freedom of religion, are inviolable, no matter what the majority of people want. There has to be a higher authority to protect those rights from infringement. I think a majority of people would eventually trade them for the promises offered by tyrants.",0

I support dropping petroleum, gas and coal for everything but the barest of the bare minimum, but currently it's not entirely feasible and we should be looking at things in-between instead of directly switching from one to the other in all matters.

"There is no conflict between farting cows and a net zero economy. The carbon that they emit by farting has been taken from the atmosphere by the grass using photosynthesis, and this is a natural process that has been going on since life began on earth.

If we stop using fossil fuels, we automatically become carbon neutral. 

(Except using oil and gas for creating plastic and other chemicals, this is where carbon capture and storage are necessary to achieve net zero emissions. Those emissions are far less than the burning of fossil fuels releases every year though.)",0

"Visitor here, have lived in Manhattan for 10 years now, trying to get some perspective, let me lend just a bit of context given i am close with a number of NYC ADAs. 

This incident occurred at 5:30am Saturday. Outside of normal working hours, ADAs work in something called the complaint room, where the police bring in suspects, police report and suggested charges and the ADAs ‚Äúwrite them up‚Äù, or make a decision on charges based on available evidence. 

This garage attendant couldn‚Äôt have been indicted yet because grand juries don‚Äôt work on the weekend. My guess is NYPD brought both in having written up attempted murder on both, ADA agreed on initial pass of available evidence (which 
 would likely only be witness accounts / hospital reports because there‚Äôs no way they get security video that quickly).

Common sense says that he was a thief and should be questioned, but when people get shot everyone gets super focused on the details.

TLDR: In NY, simple trespassing and even theft are not crimes in which lethal force would be permitted. A garage attended doesn't have authority to be a vigilanty, and the alleged thief's lawyer or public defendant would likely argue that the illegal detaining of the suspected thief is what led to the shooting.

I locked up a guy last month for my third time for burglary in two years. He‚Äôs been arrested by my agency alone 6 times and another 7 times by the county for felonies during that time span. He‚Äôs still on parole and probation from a 1983 armed robbery/murder. I‚Äôve taken four firearms off the guy in two of those arrest. Yet he‚Äôs still walking free right now.

It amazes me how people out on bond awaiting multiple trials with conditions not to commit another crime (while currently on probation) do not get their probation or bonds revoked. Judges and DAs have ruined our country and have absolute immunity- meaning they can purposely do wrong and have no consequences. Meanwhile, cops get thrown under the bus with qualified immunity (meaning if they did wrong, they don‚Äôt qualify). The best anyone can do is vote for a new judge and DA every cycle.",0

"While I do not agree with a large/well equipped police force, it's such a joke that when they do arrest someone nothing happens, I cannot imagine how futile it must feel risking your life with little reward.

Even from a ""humanitarian"" view, anyone desperate enough to be committing property crime/violent crime *deserves help*.  That help looks like *helping them by arresting and stopping the vicious cycle they are caught in.*  They *need* to be locked away because they have no defense against themselves.  A heroin addict so desperate he's committing crime needs time away from heroin, otherwise he will just keep committing the same crime, because he lacks the willpower/self control/ability to stop using drugs, will go to any length to obtain them, and has limited means to do so, and he cannot hold down a job because his disease has progressed so far, so of course he will turn to crime.  Same with people violating orders of protection... it's usually a toxic relationship and these people are addicts and emotionally stunted because of trauma or a horrible upbringing, and they simply cannot let a person go, or keep going back to them, or the relationship mends itself and is then leveraged against them.

There should be ZERO bail reform.  However, there should be MUCH MORE mental health programming in jails specifically.  Not just prisons.  The repeat offenders/drug addicts who end up in jail deserve an opportunity to learn and better themselves, as well.  But we don't.  We let them get away with the same crime 50 times, we put them in jail for a year, they get zero help in jail, or awareness of their problems, or coping skills, and then release them right back into the same environment and into the same patterns with zero additional skills, except maybe connections and friends from jail.

The upper class wants no peace, they just want us to turn on each other.  And then people defend bail reform because they think it's the most understanding option, it is \*not\* understanding, it is inhumane, and they often die before they get help.  And to top it off, the same people that bemoan incarceration/etc. *want more laws.*  More laws to accomplish what, exactly?  More police interactions?  More dead police/criminals?  More gun fights?  There is zero point to additional laws if there are no consequences for the criminal or benefit to society (helping them while incarcerated, less recidivism, etc.).",0

"Hi! Victim of a blue state here. My life is pretty great!

Despite living so close to downtown, my area is significantly safer statistically than my home red state. In fact, I've only had 1 situation where I felt any kind of danger, compared to hundreds back home. You know what they say about poverty and crime - turns out my home red state has significantly higher rates of poverty!

Speaking of poverty, I'm glad my state has a higher minimum wage. My salary is so high that we make more than we need - I'm also glad that I get taxed so much so that, as you point out, my taxes can go towards helping the homeless. See, instead of vaguely complaining about the homeless, I try to do something about it!

The only hostility I've seen from the government is towards democrats. In fact, the one situation I felt danger in that I mentioned happened to be with the police. I would say that white conservatives have a huge leg up when it comes to talking to law enforcement here!

My wife and I just bought our house, and I'm incredibly excited for us to have kids which may go to one of the best schooling systems in the country. In our schools, they will learn that we need to protect the environment, gender and sex are separate concepts, and that more guns leads to more violence. Hopefully, they won't die in a school shooting, because of course, we can't prevent guns entering our state due to some highly influential lobbying. 

Overall, we are so many leagues happier here than in our home red state I cannot even count.",0

But why.  What does this get them,0
"I agree with you (and I do not at all agree with charging the attendant , to be clear), but you‚Äôve kinda just stumbled across the *why* of bail reform. 

In large city justice systems, where judicial processing is Kafka-esque level of slow, the argument goes that we should not be locking people up to await trial when that wait could be YEARS given how easily mistakes can be made (as we clearly see here) Especially if these people are presumed innocent until proven guilty. However what was happening is the DAs would give people like this attendant bail that they couldn‚Äôt afford, so off to rikers they went. 

Combine this with how gun ownership restrictions in large cities generally are enforced against the poorer (and typically minority) populations, given they tend to live in the parts of town where one might need a gun for protection, and suddenly you can see the absurd catch 22 so many poor folks find themselves in. 

Personally, I think the founders envisioned a world where they would rather a guilty man walk free than an innocent man deprived of freedom, and what we see here is a clear case of the contrary.",0

This article is a huge mess.  The first paragraph has nothing to do with gas prices or the rest of the article.  Then the article claims Biden attacked our energy independence without explaining how, when, or what the impact was.  Then it runs a bit with how this is a benefit to Russia.  Then it suggests that Saudi Arabia is raising prices because of Biden  but fails to make a correlation to how he is involved in this decision.    

The article also links to another article (below)  which only references Biden as an agent who is fighting these rising prices.  I hope you can understand why I'm confused.  I really wish these articles were a little clearer.  If Biden is / has done something which causes gas prices to rise I would like to know what that is so I can have something to talk to my left leaning friends about.

So building houses that are on raised platforms or living spaces that start on the second floor should be the norm. Then building storm resistant designs that can deflect and sustain high wind loading again should be the norm.

Florida could start to do the same thing now; however, Governor Ron DeSantis and the legislature have not indicated that is something they are considering right now.""

Paying more for home insurance wouldn't be so frustrating if the insurance companies actually paid when damages occur but they don't or they take ages to make the pay out.

Many homeowners are getting non-renewals or renewals for $7K. Now they gotta fork over more cash for flood insurance to the tune of several thousands more.

The ""free market"" solution is that insurance rates in the riskiest places go up so high only the super wealthy can afford to live there. But the super wealthy are going to be connected enough to make sure they don't pay their fair share.

If you can't pay the government they steal your house. So people move to the cities to find work. It's all by design.

The EU had to define ‚Äúparody‚Äù in order to make it legal not to infringe upon their previous vague copyright law. You must, essentially, prove your innocence by remaining within the strictures of their definition of parody. In the US, by contrast, a copyright holder must prove guilt on the side of the parody writer to incur libel and other copyright violations.

There is no ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù here, simple logic and deduction.",0

"What a world salad just to say nothing in the end. You say that the EU and UK have no protections on free speech, yet right afterwards talk about how the right to free speech was given to them by the government. Do you think it is any different in the US just because it's written in the constitution ? Well, guess what, either way the EU has the European Court of Human Rights, ever heard of it ? Ever heard of the European Convention on Human Rights ? Ever heard of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights for a broader area ? Did you have any idea that France too had Freedom of Speech written in its constitution ? Or do you see the French constitution as inferior to the US one therefore dismiss it ? Did you know that most countries around the world, even in Africa, have Freedom of Speech written in their constitutions ? Or does it only matter when it's written in the US constitution ? 

> The US Constitution is based on natural rights as provided by God

This made me laugh. What are you going to do if the government tries to change the 1st Amendment in 5 or 50 years ? Do you think God is going to smite them to oblivion with a lightning bolt ? How is the US constitution any different than other countries' constitutions ? Or do you just feel superior because it's your countries therefore dismiss all the others' ? Do you think God personally bled to write the US constitution in sacred blood therefore it's infallible and inviolable ? 

Did you know that despite all your rambling, according to 2020 GSDI statistics there are 27 to 29 countries ahead of the US in freedom of speech, as it shares the 13th row with 2 other countries ? And guess what, 19 of those countries are in Europe, 20 if you bother counting Iceland as European, which I didn't just to please you.

The EU didn't have to define ""parody"" in any way. It already had all the protections needed in place thanks to freedom of speech laws, amendments and articles. The EU made the Parody Act just to reinforce those in stronger ways. 

So yeah, you are spreading horseshit and misinformation and I really have to ask why. Why all this hostility towards the UK, the EU, and Europe in general ? There is no simple logic and deduction, there is just pettiness and malicious intent, either intentionally or ignorantly. Did you even bother clicking on the article that OP posted ? Did you even bother checking the fact that it's an article that is over **FOUR** years old yet no freedom of speech whatsoever was breached, either due to a meme or any other parody ? Did you even bother making basic research before spouting all your nonsense or were you counting on the fact that nobody would even bother ?

Discipline makes strong men, and it's perfectly compatible with good times. Lack of resources and lack of discipline create weak men. It's just that often good times don't demand as much discipline, and people can end up letting it slide either for themselves or for their children. It needs to be artificially produced when external challenges are absent, which is part of what proper education systems include. 

This is also a problem when it comes to wealth, status, power which often overlap with good times. When it's too easy to win you don't learn as much from a lack of opposition.",0

You are personally accepted by conservatives. Conservatives are by and large the most tolerant group when it comes to people holding different opinions. If you're talking about accepting your political positions, your positions at odds with conservatives are obviously not going to be celebrated. It also doesn't help that moderates in the Republican Party have been hijacking the party while being a minority (Conservatives make up 80% of the Party, yet very little conservative positions are championed by the party). 

In a coalition there should be give and take among your coalition members. As in moderates on occasion should support more conservative agenda items to show support with their political allies. But for the last several decades it has been very one sided, where moderates use blackmailing of leaving the coalition to ""work with Democrats"" if they don't get their way. McCain being the prime example of such a platform. Then McCain acted surprised and butt hurt that conservative held him with disdain.

>the answer lies somewhere in the middle

And the left thinks the answer lies somewhere on the left. And conservatives think the answer somewhere on the right. Shocker. Now there is some truth that finding the ""truth"" about a given topic is found somewhere in the middle. As each side will spin the facts, narratives, and reporting to bias conclusions. Thus a wise person will assess the biases of the source and then use that to adjust for the conclusions of what is being read. That isn't the same thing as thinkin the ""answer"" is somewhere in the middle. That is incredibly nebulous and is also highly manipulated. As if the left keeps moving the Overton Window to the left (as they have been doing) you by default will find yourself moving to the left, not seeking solutions in the ""middle"".

>Most people also aren‚Äôt willing to compromise

Note that moderates are just as guilty. You are also ""not in the middle"" as you think. Most moderates hold some positions all over the spectrum, they aren't just some happy medium between the two political coalitions. As in on some level you do understand that hey when it comes to X issue you believe that one side of it has a correct take on it.

You will also find that if you join a coalition, helping coalition allies with their goals will mean they are more likely to support you with yours goals.

Which is what George Washington thought, which is why he was against political parties.

The issues is in a system such as ours, it's a necessary means in implementing change. You need to build a coalition to promote the cause/agenda you wish to see implemented. Organized political causes are much more successful than spontaneous political causes.

Conservatives do view politics/political parties as a necessary evil. Similar to guns, war, and the death penalty. These are not binary issues. Do we wish they didn't need to exist? For the most part. But the alternative is much, much worse.

>so I don't even want to play the game to begin with

No one wants to play the game. Well the left does seem to treat politics like a religion, so many on the left might want to. This is like saying, ""Hey I don't want to have to work a job and feed myself."" Well, it's no fun and you wish you didn't have to. But it's kind of a fact of reality whether or not you want to or like it.

A Stoic Principle (going back to Ancient Greece and later Rome) is that you have little control over what goes on in the world (as you are only a single person), but you do have control over how you react to it.

>I will vote but what I care more about than the letter next to their name is the candidates' quality of character and their values.

You will never know their quality of character. Only what you think their quality of character is. The only thing you know for certain is how they present themselves or what values they champion. Politicians are professional liars, especially when it comes to dressing up themselves. The vast majority of them are lawyers, they are not an actual sampling of the average American. Law Students spent their time in college not learning law (that's what cramming for the bar exam is for), but learning how to manipulate people towards a conclusion you want them to have.

To put simply, we would all want trustworthy and high quality candidates. The problem is the people willing to become politicians and go through all that nastiness are unlikely to be of good of character as you would hope for.

>I'm not sure if that's entirely true. While on some issues I am certainly more left or right leaning, I have yet to come across an issue that I entirely agree with one side on. There are also some issues that I am also pretty neutral about, or am simply not educated enough on the subject to hold a position.

This is typically because you haven't done enough research to understand the two sides. Surface level reads of subject might lead you to believe that. Also note that the ""sides"" hold a spectrum of beliefs and aren't just holding the Party Line.

So for instance Abortion. Pro-life hold a whole bunch of positions that do account for exceptions for abortion. You wouldn't know that based on how the media portray it. Gallup yearly polling has a break down of actual implementation of law and how Americans support it.

- No restrictions on abortion at all.
- Few restrictions on abortion (late term abortions type restrictions only).
- Few exceptions for abortion (rape, serious birth defects, incest)
- No abortion (though this is nearly unanimous that if the life of the mother is truly in danger, they will allow that exception. But this is actually not common at all).

There is your ""spectrum"" of positions. Pro-life Includes the bottom two, and pro-choice includes the top two. As people in the ""few exceptions"" category found the Roe v. Wade status quo to be abhorrent as well.

Being apolitical is a neutral term, but it's also one that hasn't bothered to invest in the issue (doing the time, research, and evaluation of it). Most Americans are apolitical on a whole host of issues. The problem with being apolitical is that it means you are easier to manipulate on the issue.",0

Some people justify their abhorrent behavior or deeds on the religion they follow, and hide behind it like cowards, not taking full responsability for their own actions.

Many many...MANY... more people hide their abhorrent behavior behind a collectivist ideology, claiming it is ""for the good of the people"" while resulting in those people's suffering and eventual death. Far more than religious people.

>I believe that my destiny is in my own hands, and that I have free will to do anything I want.

That philosophy brought to you by Judeo-Christian principles and enshrined by Western civilizations into law, also influenced and written in the shadow of Judeo-Christian principles. 

>My actions have consequences that are fully mine to own. I am also on the opinion that if you follow a religious book and preach it, you should need to follow 100% of its tenets, not just those you find convenient. 

No arugument there. But I also need obvious non-believers to stop referencing the Bible, God or religion when it is expedient (i.e. Nancy Pelosi). If you don't follow the religion then you don't get to use it as an arguing point.

>I hope that one day, in either 10 or 10.000 years, we find concrete proof of the existance of some higher powers, and maybe even interact with them.

You don't seem to understand the concept of ""faith"". It takes zero faith to believe something that you can see with your own eyes. Do you date people on that premise, that I can only date someone if I 100% know every facet of their personality? No, you have to take a leap of ""faith"" on some things.

"You raise some good points. It is indeed a necessary evil, and that‚Äôs why I still vote, even if I am sometimes undecided until literal days before election day. 

However, and I am aware that this will never happen, it would be nice to see a candidate independent of a political party with some decent ideas actually get traction in elections. However, I think a lot of voters are afraid of candidates who lean independent - at least with an R or a D next to someone‚Äôs name, you understand the overall jist of their beliefs or at least what they *pretend* to believe. It‚Äôs less unpredictable. I understand why people follow party lines, it‚Äôs just not something I personally do.

Since we‚Äôre on the topic of abortion, I suppose I lean more left, however I do not like the ‚Äúcelebration‚Äù of abortion that the left tends to make it out to be. Abortion should *not* be celebrated and only be done as a last resort after counseling and all options have been communicated to the patient. I think it‚Äôs morally wrong in all cases. However, I also believe that an individual‚Äôs bodily autonomy trumps my personal values on the subject. I guess that would make me pro-choice, but only in cases of the first few weeks of pregnancy (perhaps until end of first trimester).

They believe that if Trump wins the Republican primary, they have a shot at winning the next presidential race in 2024. They are very afraid if DeSantis or even if Pompeo wins the Republican ticket, for either of them will mop the floor with Biden.

Everyone around here who believes that Trump ""just has too much baggage"" or ""is too toxic"" doesn't really get what happened.

>As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or beliefs, but I can provide information and perspectives on the topic.

>The question of whether humans should sacrifice themselves to save the planet is a complex ethical and philosophical issue. On one hand, many people argue that humans have a moral obligation to protect the planet and all its inhabitants, including other species and future generations. ***From this perspective, sacrificing oneself to save the planet could be seen as a heroic act of selflessness and environmental stewardship.***

>On the other hand, some may argue that it is not necessary for individuals to make such a drastic sacrifice, as there are many other ways to address environmental issues that do not involve personal harm or death.

I definitely can see a world where the people with 1 or 2 visits did nothing wrong. New marks need to be eased into depravity.

In the same way, I can definitely see Epstein bringing girls to mar-a-lago. Something crossed a line there at some point though.

I can guess new marks were provided with acceptably aged people at first. Epstein‚Äôs a trustworthy friend to many, he wouldn‚Äôt do anything that could get me in trouble kinda thing. Alternatively, break them by using someone underaged from the start and having blackmail but that‚Äôs not the possibility being discussed here.

At some point there‚Äôs an obvious line crossed where someone is unarguably underaged/unwilling.
So, at what point did someone unwittingly be led into committing a crime and at what point did it become willingly.

I seriously don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs nothing to be seen even for first time visitors. I also really don‚Äôt get why Trump would be the best candidate to take to trial first. There‚Äôs too much of a difference between how he was handled and the rest of the island‚Äôs regulars. He should 100% be investigated though. I just wouldn‚Äôt put the guy not in the blackbook on trial first‚Ä¶",0
"Epstein was probably renting his plane when he wasn't using it. The flight records indicate Trump never visited the island, he probably just rented the plane once or twice.",0
If the 34 separate count information is correct I‚Äôm curious as to what additional crimes they‚Äôve charged him with and whether or not they are even related to the Stormy Daniels stuff. At most I‚Äôd say half would be Stormy related.,0
Hopefully you are talking about leftists. The bizarre indoctrination going on in schools is outrageous and unbelievable to me. The fact that some of these so-called teachers are allowed near young children is astonishing.,0
So glad she dumped him after that. His bug-eating ideas probably did not appeal to her either.,0
Trump banned Epstein from his properties due to harassing young female guests.,0
Or Bill Clinton based on Epstein's child sex trafficking victim's statement. Or Bill Clinton going to Epstein's pedo ranch.,0
Exactly!,0
Desantis is just‚Ä¶betterü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,0
I don‚Äôt think so. He could have any woman he wanted in my opinion.,0
"We‚Äôll find out on Tuesday. They have to be related to Daniels & Cohen. Cohen had a 7 count  superseding indictment - Rat . Costello was a good wit I‚Äôm hearing. It‚Äôs a huge indictment and Meg Reiss needs to recuse herself or I am filing a Bar complaint. The New York County grand jury & jury pool is scary. Kangaroo court. If Trump beats this , he will face someone I have firsthand experience with , Fulton County Judge Robert McBurney , who is anti gun , anti patriot , Liberal , foaming at the mouth for that indictment. Let‚Äôs see the defense. Trump can still run for President from jail and he‚Äôs crushing the numbers. #FreeTexMcIver #McWordy
Let‚Äôs keep in mind the DOJ said this case was weak and had no merits and refused to even bring it in front of a GJ!",0
Correct.,0
"Also didn‚Äôt he help with Epstein‚Äôs first trial?

There‚Äôs definitely evidence that Trump was at the very least either put off by his actions or shocked by something.

It‚Äôs also entirely possible at the same time Epstein brought girls to Trump and went way too far or brought something ‚Äúspecial‚Äù or did something that he wasn‚Äôt okay with at all. I. E. Trump was involved but there was a limit. Which could have simply been <18  or <16 or worse. Again it might have seemed like Epstein was an ordinary pimp for the rich and famous.

That he made a decisive action to ban him says something. What that something is I don‚Äôt know. I definitely think Epstein brought girls to him though. The question is were they underage and was that with Trump‚Äôs knowledge. I can definitely see a world where people trusted the pimp for the rich and famous because who would think that someone trusted by others is going to compromise everyone.

I can definitely see someone‚Äôs first trip to the island being a shock too. The repeaters‚Ä¶ I really doubt there‚Äôs anything one could defend them with. The only argument I could think of was the first visit was normal and subsequent ones were more messed up.

Still - why was the closest thing to damming him Trump then? I honestly don‚Äôt think it was a case of nothing happened at the island with most of them‚Ä¶",0
Yeah but... ORANGE MAN BAD!!!!1!1!,0
Hillary is almost a mitigating circumstance.,0
Probably but what does that have to do with the nonsense you said about Epstein?,0
"My son just graduated with a BS in Mathematics. His dream job, which he accepted, is to teach AP Mathematics to kids. He‚Äôs just starting out. I worry about the insanity that permeates within the public school system. I am a product of public school during the 50s to 70. Things have changed so much. Times have changed so much. God help us.",0
"Epstein was recording videos of all those powerful people with underage girls. The man was working for a state intelligence agency, most likely Israel or the USA. The Robert/Ghislaine Maxwell connection makes me lean toward Israel. Judging from the list of models, actresses, and athletes Trump dated the man needed no assistance finding women.",0
Yes that was the only reason we didn‚Äôt like himüòé,0
"Well it wasn‚Äôt nonsense because it‚Äôs a well known fact that Trump was on Epstein‚Äôs flight logs numerous times and was great friends with him, so it wouldn‚Äôt be that much of a stretch to assume trump would be an Epstein associate, and it‚Äôs just another reason Desantis I‚Äôd the better option",0
It‚Äôs not just public schools.  There are several private schools both religious and non-religious slipping into it too.,0
"I'm sure there are plenty of other reasons you don't like him. All of the reasons are enormous misrepresentations of the truth but there are lots of them, that's for sure.",0
It‚Äôs a well known fact that trump was great friends with him? Now you‚Äôre just making shit up,0
"Wow. Hard to believe the way schools have changed. No wonder our kids are in trouble technologically. My son will also be teaching some pre-Algebra classes. He loves to see kids get it and become interested in higher mathematics. I‚Äôm so proud of any kid that believes in teaching our youth at this time, especially of mine. He‚Äôs a role model to kids. Proud mom here.",0
"He pardoned war criminals, he pardoned a number of Blackwater contractors who massacred unarmed Iraqi civilians, including innocent women and children.",0

"Have you met a lot of homeless people? I take it not. Most of them don't want any help. They like their life as is. I should know, I was homeless for almost a year, and the ONLY thing keeping me and everyone around me homeless was our own choices. There were a few differences. Some had major mental health issues, but even they wouldnt accept any sort of help, apart from free food/money. 

When I decided that that life was an absolute waste of everything I had, I changed my life around. Got off drugs, got a job and did whatever I could to not go back there. 

It's not as simple as ""hurr durr throw more tax money at them"". There are deep seated psychological issues at play. There should definitely be resources out there, and for the most part there already is. Until the individual decides they want a different life, nothing, absolutely nothing will change their attitude towards life.",0
">Maybe there should be better funded programs to help them get jobs and address their mental disorders? 

Absolutely, and it would help some and improve things.

>Forcing them to go somewhere else isn't really helping public safety

Well, some of them are quite violent, so yes, so while camping bans treat the symptom and not the disease it's a dangerous enough symptom that it needs to be remedied immediately.  Sort of like using motrin or Tylenol to bring down a deadly fever. Doesn't cure what you've got, but saves you from a serious affect of it.",0

"Exactly.

"You‚Äôre missing the forest for the trees. California was at the same demographic precipice in the 1980‚Äôs when Reagan granted amnesty to millions of illegal aliens. This created a democratic super majority in a previously purple California and the state has never recovered.

This is the exact same situation we are seeing in Arizona as millions of democrat voting Hispanics are demographically altering the region into a majority minority state. If this trend continues the outcome is inevitable unless Hispanics suddenly shift their political disposition and became a majority red demographic (which everyone said would occur in 2022, but it didn‚Äôt happen). Centrist republicans aren‚Äôt ready to grapple with this fact, but they need to in order to solve this problem. Blaming liberal Californians for the political shift is futile, and does nothing to address the real issue.",0

"Yeah that is sad news. I'm not sure of the finer details of that program, but I'd like to think that homelessness simply isn't a lost cause. I wonder if a program like that could have been handled differently and worked out better.",0
"Don't you feel like a willingness to live on the street is an indication of some underlying issue? They don't have to be major mental health issues, there are minor ones that would cause that. 

Even your personal example points to drug use. 

But I'll concede I haven't lived with homeless people nor have I myself been homeless. Just saying that if homeless people are a threat to public safety, pushing them out of an area only spreads the issue outward and doesn't provide any overall improvement. Yeah, Main Street maybe doesn't have 10 incidents in a month but the county itself likely has the same number of incidents it always had. 

I don't claim to have the perfect solution. I offered some off-the-cuff suggestions but maybe someone like yourself could offer more useful suggestions.",0
"That's fair, but they aren't proposing sweeping initiatives to take care of the overall issue. Also I pointed out that it only shifts the problem. The homeless people don't magically cease to exist because they can't camp on the streets. So really it only shifts the incidents away from concentrated areas. 

If it does help it only does so because these homeless people eventually get arrested for breaking the law and then live off the state. So at the point we're just wasting money.

So using your metaphor: It's really more like using a cold compress to treat a fever from a severe infection.",0
"Yeah I mean part of the reason I disagree with it is because it will just throw more homeless people in jail. We will all still be paying for the homeless problem, but I'd rather that money go towards helping them become members of society rather than providing them food and housing in a prison cell.",0
"The CA transplants always think they‚Äôre voting for a ‚Äòmoderate‚Äô Dem, not realizing that the new Democrat party has no semblance of moderation.  Hobbs refused to debate e, gave few interviews and still won.  No one knew much about her.  It‚Äôs depressing.",0
The guy clearly said there was room at Gospel Rescue Mission.,0
"Yea it almost always has an underlying issue. 90% are drugs. Drugs, despite what we tell ourselves, are voluntary. It's tough, but 100% doable to get off drugs. But they are fun, and offer a lot to the people who use them. So much so they give up everything in their life to continue using them, including living in a building. 

And unfortunately, from what I seen, the only way to change the situation is to somehow initiate life changing epiphanies on an individual basis to every drug addict in the USA. Not really practical. Short of that, enforcing the laws on the books, valuing public safety over criminal emotional sentiments, and having a zero tolerance type policy on violence are good stepping stones. 

Trust me dude, it's bad. And those in the midst enjoy it.",0
"I don't disagree with anything you've said.  To continue the metaphor theTylenol is all we have at the moment, and you're right, we need to work on an actual working treatment for disease.  Sadly I'm sure you'll agree that will take time.",0
"You remember that old saying ""can lead a horse to water, but can't make him drink""?

"I reallydon't believe in them wanting to vote in a ""Moderate"" really, I believe that they have the mindset of believing that Republicans/Conservatives are literally ""nAziS!1!"" from watching too much Leftist media, So they have the ""Vote Blue No Matter Who!"" outlook. 

And quite frankly a lot of them don't realize WHY Democrats are bad, A substantial amount of transplants say they left California due to the drugs, The high-cost of living, The homeless, Et Cetera. But they don't understand that those reasons are caused BY the Democrats.",0
"Again, as someone who has never been a drug user, I'll appeal to your expertise. Are you saying that the general portrayal of drugs being highly addictive and causing social and financial hardship is overblown? That at the point where they are homeless, at any point, they could easily put the drugs down and fix all their problems by their own willpower?

I'm not trying to sound snide and I realize I might come off that way, but on one hand you're saying these people simply need to want it while on the other hand that they are addicted to substances that are known to ruin lives.",0
"I replied above with more information regarding the Austin situation, and yeah, I don't got an answer either. Hell, I remember first visiting here in 2019, and the homeless population had a camp below i-35 and 6th street roughly, just lining the highway. That encampment area was removed, and all that happened was the homeless moved more south and southwest towards the Southpark Meadows area and Menchaca area. Gave the area names in case you want to look up x)

And it's hard. Lots don't want help as you said, and I rmember one guy I met l, he was given an uber ride from the south area towards a small hostel/motel in downtown. Had a lot of shit luck, was trying to turn his life around, hadn't had a shower recently, and he kept apologizing for his looks and smell and you could just hear it in his voice that he was trying  to do what he could, but life, and addictions, are batshit insanely difficult at times, especially without a support net. It's. Life is hard.",0
"Yeah, I agree that it will take time, but homelessness isn't a NEW problem. So in my mind, these laws are at best trying to subvert the issue and history tells me this is where the buck stops. Because they almost never result in dramatic efforts to correct the overall issue and make meaningful change. 

Maybe I'm just cynical.",0

"I'm saying our whole attitude towards drugs as a whole is under-blown. We don't take them serious enough as a culture and it is ruining lives. 

But the main point I'm getting to is throwing tax dollars at it does nothing. There obviously needs to be treatment centers and access to care. But there already is.

Funny, but what really did it for me was jail. As well as many others.  Maybe if ide been caught or sentenced earlier in my life I wouldn't have suffered so needlessly. Again the current trend of catch and release that is ramrodding our justice system is only increasing the issues we are seeing with drugs and homelessness",0

I think he felt like it was a perfect opportunity to show some kind of compromise and show that he played it down the middle. Problem is Biden's handlers have hated Blue Dog Democrats since the Obamacare negotiation fiasco which led to Democrats leaving the Blue Dogs out to dry during the midterms.

"Don't know much about him, but I didn't know much about Ben Carson either. After I heard Ben speak and carry himself, I ended up voting for him in the primaries in '16. 

Should be interesting to learn more about him, in any case",0
"I like him.  Need to see more of him, and make sure he isn't a con artist, but I like what he says and claims to be for.  I'd be between him and DeSantis...I want a younger candidate who is smart and can debate with logic.  Both seem pretty good, though I think Vivek is more charismatic.",0
He‚Äôs terrific.,0
"The more flooded the field gets, the better chance we have at a candidate winning with well under 50% support (again).

I have heard Vivek in interviews and I think he has great ideas. I like him. But the reality is he has next-to no name recognition and is just not a viable candidate. If he stays in the race during the primaries, he is only getting in the way.",0

What is Ben Carson up to these days anyways? If he fully out of politics?,0
"I think the problem is he will take votes from DeSantis in the primary, meaning if he gets big enough that Trump will easily win....which right now I'm not sure is the worst thing.  I want DeSantis or Vivek over Trump, but I'm not sure either would do better than Trump in the general election against the Dems.  Trump voters might not show up for DeSantis or Vivek, but I think most republicans would go out and vote Trump over any D candidate.",0

"I disagree with the notion that a more sensible, down-to-Earth candidate would do worse nationally. And we really can't do worse than we did in 2020 since 2020 was a loss.",0
More to the point the left will create a shitshow proportionate to the popularity of a Republican candidate no matter who.,0
"No. I take issue with your phrasing that any Republican nominee ""creates"" anything that the Left chooses to do. The Left is solely responsible for what they do. 

My point is that whether or not GOP candidates inspire Left Wing plots and insanity, the GOP cannot be bullied or otherwise influenced over who it nominates in order to placate Leftist temper tantrums. Doing so only gives the temper tantrums antidemocratic power.",0

"Yes, that is more accurate.",0
"Rule of Law is the simple principle that no one is above the law. That includes Supreme Court Justices. The problem is the left has slowly but surely shifted into nihilism, and the elites do feel they are above the law. That the laws are for the ""little people"".",0

Absolutely wrong. The Republican party paid Glenn Simpson to look for dirt on Trump. Glenn Simpson hired Steele months after Clinton picked up the contract. [source](https://archive.ph/qlmsB).",0
"Which is why it is nonsense when anyone points to bipartisan support for assisting an anti conservative agenda since the Trump years. 

The Uniparty is not partisan nor bipartisan. Which is a bad thing for democracy.",0
The initial dossier looked nothing like what it morphed into when Clinton took it over.  Prior to that it was very benign and without all the salacious garbage.,0
"This comment is misleading.  The problem wasn‚Äôt that she paid for the dossier, but that she miss reported the payments as legal fees.  The difference is that it was obviously campaign related for her, but not for Trump.  Also, the fact that she was fined and not indicted on criminal charges.",0
"Its absolutely a ""good move"". A bad move is allowing the opposition's and the State's actions to win in determining who can be a leading candidate and who can't.",0
The initial dossier didn't even involve Steele. He was added after Fusion GPS started working for Clinton.,0
"It went from ""see if he did anything illegal, we don't want him."" To ""make it sound like he's an asset of the soviet union.""",0

"For context for non-Canadians, when the carbon tax was introduced, people rightfully called out that it would increase the cost of living.

Our government claimed that people would get rebates after filing taxes and the rebates would on average equal more than what they paid in carbon taxes, thus only financially punishing businesses who pollute.

This was BS, as what they sited for how they determined how much people should receive didn‚Äôt in fact take into account all aspects of what the carbon tax would hit.  Which was basically everything.

The government watch dog office that is appointed by the Prime Minister (in this case Trudeau) came out with a report that stated actually over 60% of Canadians would not benefit from the rebate because they ‚Äúmake too much‚Äù, the amount of rebate is based on your income, with the lowest income earners getting the most.

Now with inflation (that they caused) ontop of a crumbling economy (that they caused), the latest increase to our carbon tax now puts majority of the Canadians now paying more than even the rebate can supposedly offset.  So far it‚Äôs at best 20% of Canadians see any benefit from the rebate.

This from our PM who had a private jet fly from one city to another so he didn‚Äôt have to drive an hour in traffic to catch said private jet.  Cause living by example is for the poor.

Edit: Missed some info that was needed.",0
This peice of shit is a full on eco terrorists,0
Thank you for the breakdown. Much appreciated.,0
"The amount received is not based on your income. You can find this on Canada's official government website or by reading the instructions while filing your taxes this year.

The amount taxed at the pump is about a 7-9% increase. The amount rebated annually pays for ~35%(minor variations per province) of the average Canadians fuel usage per year at ~3l/ per capita per day.(including all gasoline used for the entire country of Canada including both buisness and personal use.)

Any other metrics addressed would need to be proven as directly tied to the carbon tax with few significant external factors to be even remotely arguable in context, which they are not.

I agree but I‚Äôd also be ok if they ran on a ticket together - Trump as President and DeSantis as VP. Trump would get all the MAGA people and DeSantis would get the moderates.

"DeSantis has no chance at becoming the nominee, especially now. He shouldn't even declare to avoid getting scuffed up in 2024. But if he does, that;s fine too. It's his career.

Trump has a better chance than DeSantis at winning the General. For all of the bitter Never Trumpers with TDS who threaten to not vote for Trump if DeSantis doesn't get the nomination, all the while claiming that MAGA is dividing the party, there are multitudes more Trump voters who now feel the same way.

This indictment is nothing but a win at the polls for Trump, in what was already going to be a very close general election.",0

If someone is willing to steal someone‚Äôs vehicle they‚Äôll probably do it again or do other criminal acts. Also stealing someone vehicle in Texas of all states is the dumbest thing you could do other than breaking into someone‚Äôs house.

"Um, I dunno.  trump put his kids in charge of the middle east, and stole top secret documents.  Lindsey Graham, Ted Cruz and Lauren Boebert are just weasels.

Getting all worked up about someone's sexual orientation.  At least implying that you would throw Ukraine to the wolves and perhaps abandon NATO. Massive government debt accrued under Republican leadership.  The list goes on.

I'm an actual conservative.  And I have no love for Nancy Pelosi; but trumpism has made it damn hard to vote R in many cases.  Look at a candidate like Hickenlooper from Colorado.  A pro business guy who is sane, and he is a Dem.  And if the Dems keep the senate it checks the massive problems associated w/ trump getting a second term (if it had happened).  Hick is an easy pick.

The Republicans need sane candidates.  trump, Walker, Oz et al don't fit that bill.  So they lose.  And similar candidates will lose next time.  People vote party, until the clown show shows up.",0
I didn't say our side was composed of Angels.  Ted Cruz is an alright guy.  I've met him and he seems pretty genuine.  MTG and Boebhert are kinda wacky though.

I‚Äôve been screaming this from the rooftops since he announced he thought he was going to be indicted. It is so plainly obvious that this is being done to help him win the primaries because everyone including democrats) knew this would happen. For some reason his loyalists just can‚Äôt see it as they all lineup to defend him harder than they ever have.,0
Nice flair lol,0
No he isn‚Äôt. By 2028 he will have been out of politics for 2 years and an afterthought just like Jeb was in 2016. Jeb waited to long to run.,0
"If he doesn't run then it's over for him. You don't get momentum like this whenever you want it, and you don't 'wait your turn'. By 2028 he'll be out of office doing nothing for 2 years, the Electoral College map could be beyond Republicans and after Trump loses again, what's to say he won't run again in 2028? 

If not him then what about a Kari lake? DeSantis would have the same issues going against her, where of course she'd go on to be absolutely crippled in the general but the base don't think like that.",0
"> he is the automatic front runner for 2028.

After being out of office for a year and out of the spotlight?  Remember, he's not Trump, he won't get free nonstop media coverage every day.  He'll be memory holed.",0
That‚Äôs because his loyalists don‚Äôt care about winning or advancing conservatism.,0
Thanks üòé,0
"Jeb was out of office for like 10 years, not 2.  A better analogy would be Clinton or Biden.  A short time out of office (would be less than 1 year by the time he would announce).",0
"Not holding office for 2 years before running for president?  Sounds like Hillary, Biden, and Jeb Bush.  They were all out of government for years before running for president.  

DeSantis could strike a deal for the Trump endorsement in 2028 by not running in 2024.  That would clear the path for him in 2028.  It‚Äôs his choice though so we will see‚Ä¶",0
"Trump ran and won by force of will, when he wanted to. Your model isn't valid. It is more like an excuse for milquetoast candidates when they lose, which allows them to evade confronting the truth of the matter.

If DeSantis is viable, then he can create his own momentum in 2028. That might actually prove that he is more than beltway anti-Trump hype. And that he actually has the political backbone and creativity to lead, rather than merely riding Trump's coat-tails.

DeSantis is about to be severely starved of attention, due to the indictment. For better or worse, he doesn't have a chance in 2024. I'd advise him to avoid your terrible advice and to wait until 2028.

But unlike DeSantis supporters in regard to Trump, it doesn't matter at all to Trump supporters if DeSantis runs. It's his career. He can scuff it up as he likes.

What I see is that Never Trumpers hate Trump so badly that they want to force DeSantis to run, regardless of his chances and without regard for the man's career.",0
So same as Biden and Clinton before they got their nominations?,0
"100% correct. They don‚Äôt even care about Trump‚Äôs policies. They like him as a person. Their vote is purely emotional. They‚Äôre much like democrats in that regard. If Trump loses the primary and he told them not to vote for whoever beat him, they wouldn‚Äôt. They don‚Äôt care that policy wise, Desantis or whoever, and Trump, agree on 90% of policy. They don‚Äôt care that democrats overturned just about everything Trump did, from the border to the economy. They would happily hand 2024 to the democrats if Trump lost the primary because their feelings would be hurt, just like Trumps.",0
But I doubt trump would care to endorse him if he lost again in 2024.,0
"One lost a primary, one lost to Trump, and the last only barely beat Trump‚Ä¶ not exactly a ringing endorsement of waiting.",0
"> DeSantis could strike a deal for the Trump endorsement in 2028 by not running in 2024. That would clear the path for him in 2028.

Hahahahahahahaha there is 0 chance Trump will honor that. 

Especially when he loses and cries fraud again. DeSantis knows that shit is unelectable so couldn't go into it too hard and Trump would hold him against it and endorse some loon instead, and the GOP has two more general election losses.",0
So what you‚Äôre saying is that it‚Äôs a cult.,0
I‚Äôve seen trumpists on Twitter saying that Trump being indicted means he 100% needs to be the nominee even if he is guaranteed to lose because of the message it says to the ‚Äòswamp‚Äô‚Ä¶,0
Imagine DeSantis being so weak he couldn‚Äôt convince his own party to vote for him on the national stage rofl.,0
Was that English?,0
Yes,0
They‚Äôre being played like a fiddle by the left.,0
Imagine being so weak that you're incapable of admitting you lost and spend four years crying stolen elections all before running again knowing darn well you have zero chance of winning the general.,0
"The Republican primary voters are much further to the right than the November voters are, so to win them you need to support policy that makes you much more likely to lose in November. 

Quite the conundrum. And the base increasingly don't care about electability and just say the result was fraudulent or stolen if they lose so there's never any introspection.",0
"The populist wing of the GOP are a bunch of cultist RINOs who would vote for a democrat if Trump told them to. 

Also, isn‚Äôt that exactly what happened to Trump with the whole never Trump movement? I mean the suburbs have basically abandoned the GOP thanks to Trump, when the suburbs were the core of the GOP.",0
Is that not the kind of thing we should be trying to avoid?,0
Imagine being so weak that your only (not a) chance of gaining ground in support is desperate redditors literally begging people to vote for you every day.,0
"Ah yes, the ‚ÄòMitt Romney‚Äô argument.",0
"Is that like the lack of introspection from ""not fraud"" supporters when, to be able to make any semblance of a point, they have to ignore massively significant voting procedures changes toward less election security? Procedures changes that came in the context of DNC State lockdowns and year-long DNC ultra-violent election terrorism.",0
"Yes, we all remember how wildly successful Romney and McCain were running for president.  Please come back to the real world.",0
"Yes. I‚Äôm not voting for Trump in the primary. I hope he doesn‚Äôt win. I‚Äôm voting for Desantis and I like Vivek Ramaswamy a lot too. 

That said, if Trump does end up winning the primary I will vote for him in the general because the policies are far more important than the person. I‚Äôm all about voting for whoever has the best chance to end the open borders, the hostility towards the first and second amendments, and the economy killing policies that the democrats seem so fond of. Whether I like the person themselves or not does not make the list of my top 100 concerns.",0
"Trump has won 1 election and lost the GOP 3.

Not to mention he barely beat Hillary Clinton and lost to the walking corpse of Joe Biden.  McCain was screwed as soon as Lehman went under and Romney was facing a sitting President with approval ratings above 50%. No president loses that scenario. Trump would have lost both of those elections.

Funny enough Trumpists love to hate on Bush when he won 3 out of 4 elections and was the last GOP nominee to win a majority of the popular vote. 

People like you who think Trump is a winner need to come back to the real world.",0
That's fair. I do think the most important quality of a leader is the ability to unify a people and I'd say we would agree that Trump is a divisive leader. This political war has seeped so much into the everyday life that no one's happy at all. It's rough.,0
"Bush brought us the Patriot Act and 2 failed wars causing the deaths of millions.  He is correctly remembered as a horrible president.  That is why no one is trying to recreate his corporate neocon GOP.  Their time is passed and I find it funny that someone with a ‚ÄòLibertarian Conservative‚Äô tag is celebrating him.

The only election Trump lost was in the middle of a once in a century pandemic with no end in sight.  No one wins in that environment where everyone is mad and needs an outlet.",0
"So would you just not vote if Trump were to be the nominee, or would you vote for Biden? Or maybe someone who doesn‚Äôt really have a chance and runs as a 3rd party candidate?",0
"Lololol. You honestly believe Trump didn‚Äôt lose in 2018 and 2022?

PS: Afghanistan wasn‚Äôt failed until Trump surrendered to a bunch of terrorists and we are better off now in Iraq than we were in 2003.",0
It‚Äôs too early for me to speculate on that yet.,0
"Who did you vote for in 2020, if you don‚Äôt mind me asking? If anyone",0
"Key graf: ""They are geographically (and culturally) isolated from the vast majority of Americans. They are highly credentialed, prone to ""egotism and self-absorption,"" loath to admit mistakes and correct them.

They've been absorbed into The Establishment, grown too cozy and incestually involved with the powerful figures they're supposed to be scrutinizing, too aloof and even hostile toward the public they're supposed to serve.""",0
"Seriously. Can you believe that when one of these ""journalists"" was sued, he defended himself by saying that his program was intended as entertainment and that no reasonable person should believe what he says. Oh wait, that was Tucker Carlson. That is who you're talking about right? Since he is, somehow, the most watched ""news"" program in America that must, by definition, make him mainstream.",0
Sounds about right,0
This is a legal problem.   It is fault of the legislature which wrote law allowing this type of defense,0
"No, the problem is that millions of people still watch and believe someone who has admitted he is a fraud.",0
"If you're an adult and you want to pretend you're something you're not go for it we don't care and will leave you alone.

The problem comes with going after children trying to persuade them into something they are not and trying to force every one to affirm your fantasy.  

The push back is coming, and it's coming hard.",0

Thats not the comparison being made.  The idea that just because the federal troops are ""Americans"" does not mean that somehow prevents them from enforcing totalitarian laws on other Americans.  We are not where China was in the 80s at this point, but we are certain numbers of steps towards getting there.  DC being in charge of local law enforcement certainly pushes us in that direction.

It's important to consider the practical implications of such restrictions.

"Natural ‚â† healthy. Plenty of natural things are *very* unhealthy (like most viruses and diseases); plenty of lab-made foods and items are simply better than their ""natural"" counterparts.

Finally, the meat you eat today isn't anywhere close to natural. Just about every strain of farm animal has gone through literal centuries of selective breeding (ie deliberate and scientific genetic alteration) to be fatter and unhealthier than ever before. Many chickens, cows, etc today are so heavily mutated that their legs can't even support how fat we have bred them to be. They simply collapse from their weight and lie in their own waste.

99% of the meat people eat today comes from these heavily mutated animals.",0

"One well-studied part of evolution is antagonistic pleiotropy, which is a phenomenon where a genetic adaptation can have a positive short-term effect on reproductive success but negative long-term effects on health. If we have more adaptations to a given food, that increases the likelihood that one or more of those adaptations has this trade-off. Novel foods haven't been adapted to beyond the nutrients they are composed of. So, if an ancestral food and novel food had the same nutrients and had not been studied for long-term health outcomes, I'd wager on the novel food having better long-term health outcomes on average.",0

Im not advocating to replace the meat industry with lab grown meat at all, ultimately don't care much outside of potential use cases where actual meat isn't viable (space travel, for instance, would have a huge benefit from this), and don't advocate on any moralistic grounds. However the arguments posed against it are beyond silly and just utterly ignorant.

There is no reason to ban it outright, and banning insecta is even dumber (as they are *already* a staple food source through our the world). Require labeling? Sure, that's fine. I'm an advocate for people knowing what they are eating. Banning it is just ridiculous.",0

"This is just plain silly, and school-cbild level logic. Your body evolved mechanisms to break down and process proteins into amino acids, and create protein out of amino acids. That's it. Whatever form those proteins are in does not particularly matter, outside of certain forms of protein (plants, for instance) being more difficult to extract.  

Lab grown meat will have no real difference on a cellular, molecular, etc. Level as compared to real meat. Lab grown meat is literally just animal muscle protein cultured in a lab, given nutrients it needs to produce cell mitosis, and mechanisms in place to further encourage the development of this tissue. The end result is literally just a wad of animal muscle cell tissue of the constituent animal, largely no different than a chicken nugget.  There is no reason in the world your body would have a problem digesting it, as it is actual animal tissue.

This is like saying we can't digest pastes made from animal meat because we didn't evolve to eat meat paste. The actual digestive process doesn't give a crap about the physical form of the protein.",0

Doing so only manages to create an illusion of the connection, most especially to people of lesser intellect with a desire to project their negative viewpoint on the subject. It would largely be irresponsible to suggest it as relevant.

An example could be to single out another trait as if to suggest a connection to singular events of intense negative outcomes as though they were in some way relevant to the event:

‚ÄúThe perpetrator was a white male who was for years deprived of sex from his wife, being morbidly obese with club feet and erectile disfunction.‚Äù

It‚Äôs probably fair that none of the above has any connection between many persons causing mass shootings, so it‚Äôs probably fair that a person being transgender also has no connection, either; and is therefore irrelevant.

"I used to like Colbert's show when he first started to host his own program. He broke the fourth wall to share some frankly terrible opinions even then, but at least most of what he did was parody of the mainstream news, and it was pretty funny because they've always been easy to laugh at. And while he lampooned President Bush in ways that some people would say were deeply disrespectful to the office, let's face it, Dubya tried to hard to spin his public persona and was an eminently memeable figure.

Then Obama won the presidency in 2008 and Colbert did a 180, becoming just another attack dog faithfully serving the administration in power, every night savaging the enemy of the hour. And it's just been downhill since there. I've seen YouTube clips once or twice since 2020 and I don't think he even does any parody at all anymore. It's all just rants about how the party in power knows best and the opposition are all scum that ought to curl up and die.

The parallels between how they view courts and how the Nazis viewed courts are undeniable. 

[People‚Äôs Courts - Nazi Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Court_(Germany))

> The proceedings of the court were often even less than show trials in that some cases, such as that of Sophie Scholl and her brother Hans Scholl and fellow White Rose activists, trials were concluded in less than an hour without evidence being presented or arguments made by either side. The president of the court often acted as prosecutor, denouncing defendants, then pronouncing his verdict and sentence without objection from defense counsel, who usually remained silent throughout. The court almost always sided with the prosecution, to the point that, from 1943 on, being brought before it was tantamount to a death sentence. While Nazi Germany was not a rule of law state, the People's Court frequently dispensed with even the nominal laws and procedures of regular German trials and is therefore characterized as a kangaroo court.[2]

> **There was no presumption of innocence nor could the defendants adequately represent themselves or consult counsel. A proceeding at the People's Court would follow an initial indictment in which a state or city prosecutor would forward the names of the accused to the Volksgerichtshof for charges of a political nature**. Defendants were hardly ever allowed to speak to their attorneys beforehand and when they did the defense lawyer would usually simply answer questions about how the trial would proceed and refrain from any legal advice.

>The People's Court proceedings began when the accused were led to a prisoner's dock under armed police escort. The presiding judge would read the charges and then call the accused forward for ""examination"". Although the court had a prosecutor, it was usually the judge who asked the questions. **Defendants were often berated during the examination and never allowed to respond with any sort of lengthy reply.** After a barrage of insults and condemnation, the accused would be ordered back to the dock with the order ""examination concluded"".[citation needed]

>After examination, the defense attorney would be asked if they had any statements or questions. Defense lawyers were present simply as a formality and hardly ever rose to speak. The judge would then ask the defendants for a statement during which time more insults and berating comments would be shouted at the accused. The verdict, which was almost always ""guilty"", would then be announced and the sentence handed down at the same time. In all, an appearance before the People's Court could take as little as fifteen minutes.

"From the article:

>""You'll no doubt find that the Bible, under Utah Code Ann. ¬ß 76-10-1227, has 'no serious values for minors' because it's pornographic by our new definition.""

It looks like the parent was pointing out the hypocrisy of characterizing everything that had any ""adult"" elements as being ""porn,"" and not actually calling the bible pornographic.  Similar to the issues of the statue of David people are currently arguing about.

ETA:  Take a look at [https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title76/Chapter10/76-10-S1227.html?v=C76-10-S1227\_1800010118000101](https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title76/Chapter10/76-10-S1227.html?v=C76-10-S1227_1800010118000101) which clearly provides that (by definition) the description of ""sexual intercourse"" (as in the case of Lot's daughters in Genesis 19:30-36) renders a work as indecent and unable to have any serious value for minors.  At least David's statue escapes that *automatic* characterization by falling under section 1227(b)(i)(A).

A bible with prescribed reading for different ages isn‚Äôt bad. It‚Äôs something I did every morning for years. When I was older I had to read it front to back and it genuinely wasn‚Äôt that bad to do. Song of Solomon was insanely titillating for someone just entering puberty though!",0

I don't believe anyone would argue that outright porn should be available in schools, so obviously (I think) we all agree that a line needs to be drawn somewhere.

In desert storm we had thousands of M1A1 Abrams and Bradley IFVs backed up by the strongest air force in human history. And thats before we talk about our coalition allies. The Ukrainians have 0 western tanks on the battlefield and their air force air force is basically irrelevant at this stage.  They do not have an overall advantage in technology or numbers. Not a decisive one by any means.

&nbsp;

A war where neither side has an effective air force and neither side has an overwhelming advantage is not going to end in a week. The sides are too equally matched on the front. Look at how the Iran-Iraq war went instead of desert storm. That war went on for 8 years just so you know.",0
"So in 2023 no one has a jet? Okay.

Well if that‚Äôs the case then the rest of the world is truly backwards and you‚Äôd be right.

Guess so!",0
"They have Jets. The Russians also have a metric fuckton of SAMs and AAA(IADS). The Russian air force is having the same problem with Ukrainian IADS.  This is leading to neither side being able to impact the war in a major way from the air. 


&nbsp;

 In the gulf war the USAF and USN were able to overcome a similar situation with overwhelming airpower and airborne electronic warfare combined with drones, stealth aircraft and cruise missiles. Neither side in the Ukraine war is capable of that level of operations or has the advanced technology required in anywhere near the required amounts. The Ukrainians simply don't have the equipment and while the Russian air force has it on paper they have shown themselves to be rather incompetent in actually using their air power to any real effect.

&nbsp;

The USAF and USN are far and away the most powerful air forces in the world.  It isn't even a contest. No one else can do what they do on the scale they do it on.

&nbsp;

In one way you can sort of say this is what Desert Storm might have looked like if the coalition forces did not have the overwhelming air superiority that they did. Though that would also be discounting the coalition's superiority in land warfare equipment and training.",0

"Guessing you‚Äôre a man, and no real experience with obstetrics. What you‚Äôre talking about is an ectopic pregnancy which is dangerous to both mother & child. There‚Äôs a reason those pregnancies are always classified as life threatening and terminated. 

First, your GI tract can rupture, leading to massive hemorrhaging. The placenta plays a huge role, and if it becomes adhered to any of the other organs it‚Äôs life threatening. Normally a uterus expels the placenta; if left in the body it can lead to sepsis; and if you remove it when it‚Äôs adhered to other organs it normally causes severe blood loss. If attached to the intestines it can also cause bowel blockage. 

Babies of ectopic pregnancies are often deformed due to a lack of the uterine walls & being compressed in ways it should not be by the other organs. 

More than just implantation is necessary. You also need just the right balance of estrogen & progesterone to carry a pregnancy to term. 

There‚Äôs a reason those with XY chromosomes are not designed to have babies.",0

I'm just saying there are cases where a woman carried a child to birth that wasn't in her womb. Technically there isn't a reason a man couldn't do the same. It just couldn't happen naturally. Ectopic pregnancies are more common on the ovaries and you always need to be removed. The intestine is the only  place really large enough and with enough blood flow the fetus can survive.,0

But in a cold environment the waste heat of an incandescent bulb just heats the house instead, so it's not actually a waste.

The biggest benefit is actually their longer lifespan, if you buy a good quality LED. Unfortunately there are a lot of crap LEDs on the market that die long before they should due to faulty electronics, which will probably only increase due to legislation like this.",0

Most of the landlords had a thin margin between what they were covering for their fixed expenses and what they took in for rent.  Their wealth creation was from paying off the mortgage, not a monthly income stream.  When their monthly tax obligations went up by a couple hundred it was not possible to transfer the expense over.  When rents for your units are 550-600 a month (this was a couple decades ago), it's not possible to raise those rents over 800.  If it was, they would have been doing it already.

The idea there are a bunch of rich people who own properties and they can all afford to pass their wealth on because a tenant decides to quit their good paying job for something easier, or a tenant that went into credit card debt for new stuff is typical leftist bullshit. 

I'm sure there are rich landlords in the city, or Albany, or where ever.  I'm also sure there are tens of thousands of landlords who aren't rich and who are just getting by.  They put their life long saving into buy a couple homes to rent, or they put their mother-in-law property up for rent when she passed.  That's how the average guy gets ahead in life.

The responsible people I know who have these issues have developed skills and methods for compensating for or mitigating the tendencies that come with their disability, at least when it comes to their livelihood. The people who don't just want to be a victim and given a hand out. 

I'm not saying have zero empathy for someone who has a disability like those and is clearly trying and makes a mistake, ya know, like everyone else, but equality means holding everyone to equal standards. Equity is a joke. Some people do have it harder than others and need to work a little more to reach society's (or business) acceptable standards but if anything that just makes those people that much stronger for having overcome what they have.",0

Sometimes I don't act quite like normal people.  I'm not very friendly, I don't get jokes, I have a hard time with too much noise and disorganization.  But I think it's perfectly reasonable for an employer to expect me to show up on time, not cancel for no reason, and generally get my stuff done with a minimum of drama.

"I have autism and I find that offensive.

I struggle with keeping my emotions in check at work sometimes, but ignoring that, I can do everything asked of me at my job, and quite well. Do we have to work more than others? Yes, but the beauty of capitalism is if you're good at something and can monetize it and work at it, you will find a role and succeed.

Things like being understanding when I don't understand sarcasm, letting me wear earplugs in loud environments (although I wouldn't choose a job like that in the first place), and just generally understanding why I'm kind of... Awkward sometimes are all great things.  

But when we're talking about behaviors like these that would actually hold my coworkers back...  I don't want charity.  If I'm holding a place back by working there, due to my autism or anything else, I don't want to work there.  

Reasonable accommodations are great, things that cost little to nothing and don't negatively impact coworkers or change the very nature of the position.  But these accommodations are *unreasonable.*",0

They don't seem to understand that you're hiring someone to do a job, so that they can try and make money for your own family. They don't understand how hard it is to find good employees to make your business run, and that making good hiring decisions can be the defining factor in whether or not you're able to keep your doors open and avoid bankruptcy.

So sure, they think that you can hire an employee who is always late, cancels last minute, has emotional outbursts to customers and in front of customers, and none of that is going to affect your bottom line. They don't understand the realities of running a business.",0
"Wrong. I am autistic, medically tested. The reason why I am where I am in my job, is because I DO NOT come late, I DO NOT have meltdowns, I DO NOT b1tch around, I AM NOT disorganised, except at home ;P. Never did, never had.  I work as COO in a company, and the only reason I'm not CEO, is that I refused it, because I don't like taking care of 200+ people.  That ""person"" in the tweet or whatever it is, uses neurodiversity to fit lazy, anti-social and immature people into a place where they don't belong. As a autist I feel discriminated by this clearly uninformed or lying troll.",0
"Lateness - sorry, no, there is no excuse for not learning to compensate

Last-Minute cancellations - again, sorry but no. If you cannot learn to cover for your responsibilities you have no business having responsibilities. 

Rejection-sensitive dysphoria - I had to look this up - it just means do not be an asshole to people and you should be fine. If someone cannot take constructive criticism given in a manner appropriate to the situation they shouldn't have responsibilities that may require their performance to be criticised. Ironic since so many of these people are creatives who will deal with this for the entirety of their careers.

Understand Emotional Dysregulation - This one is valid. I managed someone on the spectrum. Brilliant, but easily agitated. This one employee made me a much better manager because I had to learn to approach them different. As a manager it was my job to get the best performance from everyone while maintaining a healthy work environment. I learned to pay attention to how this person responded to things and I changed my behavior enough to minimize this employees reactions to anything that might set them off. Mind you this person was actually on the spectrum, not just a sensitive person looking for excuses to be difficult. It took almost no effort once I figured it out and was more than worth the time figuring it out. 

Flexibility - this one is too open ended to respond. Some flexibility is always needed with every employee. 

Intensity - Again too open ended - if someone is aggressive and making the workplace feel on edge then sorry, no. If someone is excited and contributing positively to the goals then sure, I will be more than happy to help that person learn to temper their excitement in order to be a better communicator. 

Forgive disorganization - once more too open ended. Is your desk a little unorganized or are you missing goals and deadlines and affecting other teams from getting their jobs done. 

And finally, if any of these put others safety at risk it is a flat out no, you should not be doing that job.",0

1. Get on medicine and/or counseling.
2. Find a job where you can have a flexible schedule out of the house or at home, one that pays you for what you get done, no salary. That might be an incentive. 
3. If those don't work, try getting on disability. But that probably won't happen unless your doctor renders you untreatable or unable to work due to mental issues.

Absolutely you can come across people who understand you and get how you work‚Ä¶but sometimes you won‚Äôt. And that‚Äôs ok. It‚Äôs on YOU to navigate these challenges and become the best version of yourself that you can be.

I am an awesome leader in the work place. I make a great manager, I‚Äôm competent and the people below me respect me. But I am terrible at following other peoples directions‚Ä¶things just don‚Äôt stick when people tell me things. I forget what they said or I‚Äôll only hear parts of it. I‚Äôve been told all my life that I have ‚Äúno common sense‚Äù or I‚Äôm an idiot or whatever the case may be. I know these things aren‚Äôt true, and I do wish more people understood ADHD and how we are kind of all over the place and sometimes we have serious brain fog that we can‚Äôt seem to shake, but it doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre dumb or that we lack leadership skills or intellect. Everyone loves me as a manager because I have my own system and I get the job done. My whole life I‚Äôve been like ‚Äúif people would just give me a chance I can prove to them that I can do the job‚Äù, and then I get into a leadership position and everybody is eating their words. I really just can‚Äôt follow other peoples systems, I have a very hard time with that.

It‚Äôs all about looking at the positives of each individual and seeing what they offer the team and working with that. If someone has a particular system or way of working that suits them better, then I let them do their thing, because that‚Äôs how they work best. For the most part I let them play to their strengths, but I do challenge them sometimes to put them outside their comfort zone a little.

So yeah, like I said, I get what she‚Äôs saying, I do admit that life really isn‚Äôt very fair to people with ADHD. We don‚Äôt even have the benefit of having a condition that people take seriously, so we just get called lazy, but at the end of the day, you are dealt the cards that you are dealt and you gotta do the best you can in life.

In today's day and age lateness is less and less excusable than it was 20-30 years ago. Today everybody has a smartphone on them which can give you appointment alerts and notifications. I rely heavily on these as I can easily get sucked into a project and completely lose track of time. It's also one of the reasons why I have a cuckoo clock in my house. It's a subtle reminder that 30 minutes has gone by each time it goes off. I don't always cognitively recognize it but it's a subconscious poke more than anything.,0
"This is really it, here. Take responsibility for yourself. Just because you have neurodivergence doesn't mean people should condone bad behavior. And most of these neurodivergencies also come along with benefits as well, not just challenges. I know that I'm just not very effective in a role that requires tons of multi-tasking. However, I blow most people out of the water if I am responsible for 1 major task (it helps if I find that task interesting). So I went to work in an industry that I find interesting, and that greatly rewards people with long attention spans for doing 1 thing. In the event that I need to multi-task, I know I need to make a list or I will just go in circles getting 5% of each thing done. With the list to tell me what to do, I can crank it out. I also set alarms like you. Take responsibility for yourself and be a good team mate and your boss/team won't give a shit the times that you fail.

That's the level they and everyone else ""accept"" others at when they're not really interested.  Civility is literally what *civil*ization is built on.

""Accept neurodivergent realities""  I already do this, I accept reality.  Singular.  There is only one.  Delusion does not create some splinter or alternate reality.

No one gets a seat at the table, respect, or ""acceptation"" by default.  These things are typically earned, not granted out of hand.

I use that variation because it is precisely what they mean.  Approval, validation, positive reaction

It is a narcissistic manipulation at root.

That's the thought process.

They're *not* actually neurodivergent enough to say that out-loud, apparently they are capable of seeing it as bad...but they want to express it anyways, so they run it through the PR filter to try to sneak it past.

>""If you're not inclusive, that is... *problematic*.""

Nevermind that it is clearly a double standard, inherently not even equitable, much less equality minded.  The woke null state, their default scenario, is that some people are more deserving than others, almost as if they were born into it, like they are aristocrats.",0

"Most employers or organizations have Policies and Processes to follow,. such as (a loose generic example):

* a pattern of employee behavior starts cropping up.. your Supervisor or Manager talks to you about it,. maybe gives you a verbal warning (assuming of course.. the pattern is an obvious thing.. such as ""you were late to work 7 days in a row"".. or some other unarguable violation)

* If the pattern continues (even after verbal warning). .you're given a written warning and given a time-scope to correct the behavior (maybe 30 days, 60 days, 90 days etc) 

* If you still don't correct the behavior.. multiple written warnings turn into HR action to put you on PIP (performance improvement plan) or maybe just flat terminated (depending on the severity of the violation,. say for example you are sexually harrassing other employees,. that could be severe enough to just get you immediately terminated).. or other safety related examples like drunk-driving. 

This is less of a ""hard policy"" thing.. and more of a ""how (ethically) do you treat your employees?""

* If you know an Employee is going through a hard time (depression, death of a significan other, house burned down ,. etc).. your Organization may not have any policy around that,. but it is the correct and ethical thing to give them a bit more understanding and flexibility 

* You can't discriminate against specific individual employees. So whatever Policy or allowances have to be fair and equitable across all your employees. if an Employee wants to be on a modified schedule for religious reasons (Muslim, Catholic during Lent, etc).. or if a Pregnant woman evolves through her pregnancy,. or if a specific Employee is neuro-divergent (autistic, diagnosed with ADHD, diagnosed with some specific Depressive condition, etc).. you may be legally obligated to use good judgement to shape some accommodations around them. 

How an organization treats it's people.. is more about just ""good human ethical behavior"".. than it is ""what you're legally obligated to do"".",0

"In a professional environment you're okay with lateness, last minute cancelations and emotional disregulation? How does that work for coworkers forced to pick up the slack or deal with emotionally charged coworkers?",0
"Context: I'm a neuropsychologist (focus on brain injuries, strokes, general cognitive functioning)

I'm with you, and of course there's more latitude to be given when it's more severe. 

The reality is autism traits fall on a spectrum, at it's core is social cognition. Some people are very socially adept and might be called social butterflies, charismatic, etc. On the other end we have very severe autism where the person can grasp that others have their own mind and will. We all fall somewhere in between. Where the demarcation point is for a _disorder_ comes down to functional impairment. There's more to it but that's a core truth and it's the same for things like intelligent deficits, ADHD, etc. 

The issue is there's a trend to get diagnosed from Dr. Social media. There are people who overly embrace the neurodivergent term when they aren't, or it's very mild.  They identify some traits that by definition _we all have some times_ (even a social butterfly occasionally fails to read the room, or make a poorly timed comment) and call it a disorder then demand acceptance and equity in results. 

They aren't many. And I've seen more online it seems, but I have worked with some people that fall into category and it can be very grating telling them they don't have a disorder, that they're cognitively healthy.",0

HR got into some trouble with how they had people classified as hourly or salaried, a 3rd party interviewed a bunch of us about are job and made recommendations. Most of the salaried with no over time people got 15-20% raises too. 

I frequently stayed late at least once a week to help out a team. Never cared if I had to stay as it was usually known about I‚Äôm advanced and I liked the over time.",0

It leaves the rest of us covering our ass because we will get fired.",0
"Eh, I dunno, constant tardiness, calling out, cancelling plans etc, I consider those negative.",0

Combination presenting- a mix of the two. Though there are many variations on this, like a sliding scale, sometimes one side overpowers the other.

"Unfortunately it's not popular to brain anymore. All science (and evidence in general) is invalid because ""woke"", or it doesn't agree with so-called common sense. Unless of course it aligns with something we want. Unfortunately this isn't a new development in this space. 

There *is* inherently a *prosocial* bias in the social sciences - the study of human behavior is motivated by the desire to help people and improve. For example, a clinical psychologist is next to useless if they just sit there and observe - it's the dialogue that helps to drive the patient to a conclusion. It's also not acceptable to promote machiavellianism - because that's bad. So the bias is always towards ""good"". 

That bias is fine, in and of itself, but where it slams into reality and makes waves is where it's not handled well.

If that tweet/LinkedIn post/whatever said: don't be a micromanager and a Nazi about aspects of the working environment that don't really matter, there'd probably be less controversy. There are plenty of shitty, petty AF bosses - especially at entry level - and these fiefdom lords need intro to leadership and anger management courses. The way this post is phrased, weaponizing science, that message pisses people off, particularly those who are easily triggered by ""woke"". Even if the message is correct, or at least its intentions are good. For jobs that don't actually require ass in chair (to interact with customers, operate machinery on a line, etc) , there's little benefit to being a dick about *occasional* lateness, for example. Traffic sucks, trains run late, etc etc. *Chronic* lateness is a separate issue. 

Historically, conservatives have been the ones going on moral crusades. Usually, those crusades do more harm in the long run than good (war on drugs, etc). The ""woke"" movement is simply progressives doing the same shit for a change. It's the logical conclusion to the prior SJW/microaggression/safe space arc. The smart move would be to inject some well-reasoned sanity into the conversation instead of reflexively clutching pearls about ""woke"", but that would be bad for ratings.",0

Yes, you didnt make it but your still shilling it out. If you disagreed with it in anyway you should of prefaced that instead of spreading this garbage.

An hourly employee who wanted to be scheduled to be at work a bit later because of obligations to their family should discuss that with their boss so that they make up for the time on the clock (or don't, just be scheduled appropriately).

The Democrats **want** Trump as their opponent in 2024. They don‚Äôt want DeSantis. They don‚Äôt want Haley. They don‚Äôt want Pompeo or Pence or Scott or Noem. They want Trump because they know Trump gives them the best chance of winning.

Why is this apparently hard for everyone except Barr and a number of conservatives to understand?",0
That‚Äôs what we thought about the political impeachment hoaxes but it only happens when the other party gets the majorities.,0
The Clinton‚Äôs and Bidens should have been jailed decades ago not for revenge but because they‚Äôre both career grifters,0

If its all morally relative and the *only* thing that matters is winning, then its nothing but red team blue team and who gets power?  I'm not saying do nothing, and actions have to have consequences, BUT its a hell of a tightrope to walk, and if it becomes a fight of principles-be-damned then that throws out the people where principles are what drive them and weaken your own alliance in the name of a cathartic release.",0

Gop lacks a supermajority to remove Biden and would just end up with Harris. Impeachment is a good pr stunt for the Left because they control the media.,0

"I‚Äôm in law enforcement in NYC and have significant knowledge and experience in this exact topic. It‚Äôs not the DA‚Äôs, ADAs and judges so much as it is the legislature, which enacted a trio of laws recently, that are making it extremely difficult to effectively prosecute criminals and keep the community safe.

1. ‚ÄúRaise the Age‚Äù brought the age of criminal liability from 16 to 18, pushing the majority of 16 and 17 year old criminals into the juvenile delinquency system. Those matters are prosecuted by the City prosecutors in Family Court, rather than by ADAs in Criminal Court and they are not exposed to adult sentencing and there is no bail. Since plenty of violent crime in the City is committed by 16 and 17 year olds, this had pretty obvious negative effects. It‚Äôs not to say the prosecutors and judges aren‚Äôt trying, but the legislature tied their hands.

2. Bail reform. The Legislature made it difficult or impossible to set bail on criminal defendants in most cases. This allows criminal defendants to offend and reoffend without being held on bail. Trust me, the judges and ADAs don‚Äôt like it any more than you do. But again, the legislature‚Ä¶.

3. The new discovery law. Prosecutors need to disclose certain material to the defense within a certain amount of time under NY and Constitutional law. That‚Äôs been the rule forever and it‚Äôs been doable. However, In 2020, the Legislature significantly increased that timeframe to an impossibly fast one that causes lots of cases to be dismissed because ADAs just cannot keep up. This also caused a huge amount of attrition in all the prosecutors‚Äô offices because the job became essentially impossibly and pointless to many attorneys. They left for less stressful and higher paid work in the private sector. There has been a lot of press on that point recently in NYC.

I hope that gives you guys some honest context of the reality here in NYC.",0
"Judges and prosecutors have judicial and prosecutorial immunity. It's far more absolute than the qualified immunity that leftists complain about cops having. A prosecutor can knowingly and maliciously withhold evidence to get a wrongful conviction and not be held personally liable.

It's a system that only works if all judges and prosecutors are moral and righteous people. But this country has such a shortage or moral and righteous people these days.",0

Lets look at the Florida law. It merely demands that materials in classrooms and school libraries be age appropriate. The books would still be available at bookstores. It would still be printed and distributed. It could even be found in local non-school libraries. 

It's quite telling that parents [aren't allowed to read passages of these books in school board meetings](https://news.yahoo.com/speaker-kicked-florida-school-board-013558337.html), but those same boards insist that same book is appropriate for a classroom. ü§î",0

Combat vets have very real PTSD, and they may want to just step out for some fresh air if a modern history class is going to show war footage. The footage can be good to educate, but the combat vet with PTSD already has that part of the education.

If it's some sort of healthcare class, and the topic of the day is discussing rape, someone whose been brutally raped or suffered sexual abuse as a child might appreciate stepping out for that part of the class with a little heads up. 

Over the top trigger warnings for any little thing are obviously problematic, but for those who have suffered awful experiences in their past, a courteous heads up shouldn't be a controversial thing.",0
"The problem is that there is no evidence that these sorts of trigger warnings do any good for people with trauma. Triggers are complex and highly personalized, and almost never if ever as simple as ""discussing subject matter related to a trauma in a classroom is triggering"". Actual triggers can be things like sights, sounds, or smells that are associated with the trauma, often in non-obvious ways.

So veterans may be triggered by the sound and smell of fireworks, which trigger traumatic memories of combat due to their similarity to gunfire. But they are unlikely to be triggered by a classroom discussion of war.",0

"For sure, yeah. 

The big question is: who gets to decide what constitutes ""graphic content""? Do we leave it up to individual professors to exercise common sense? Or does it need to be regulated at a higher level of management within the university?

Obviously war footage and discussion of rape are sensitive topics, and deserve Consideration. That much should be obvious. But who knows who might get triggered by what. For example... .. Oh, I dunno... People having a ham sandwich? (eating meat). Some people get triggered by that. Do we provide trigger warnings for that? I posit that's absurd. But who am I to say? I'm just some jackass on reddit.

People would have you believe that the choice is binary: either let profs exercise common sense, or we delegate the decision to management. Frankly, I'm more middle-of-the-road: I suggest having the university publish a blanket guidance (a policy that's unenforceabable) *suggesting* that as a best-practicd certain content be prefaced with a content warning. List the sorts of content that some people might be troubled by, the reason why it's best practice to provide a content warning, and publish it in an annual issue of guidance to all university teaching staff - then let them decide in their own classrooms how to conduct things. If someone gets butt hurt, it then becomes an issue between the student and the professor.",0

"You have to be 18-21 to go into strip clubs depending on the jurisdiction - drag shows are literally the same thing. They try to claim it isn‚Äôt, but it is a very sexualized performance. Idc the gender, children should not be subjected to ‚Äúshows‚Äù like these

Edit: If straight men/women did what drag performers & pride Parades did in public streets they would be arrested so quickly and would be labeled sex offenders. It‚Äôs so insane what they are able to get away with because of how they label it. Specifically in Atlanta during Pride Parades men are literally naked and whipping each other, giving each other blowjobs in public etc. But if you criticize it, you‚Äôre a bigot that should be cancelled. Also there are so many small children there with their parents - the parents should be arrested as well",0

"What is ""vague"" about doing a sexually charged performance featuring cross dressing in front of children? Seems really specific actually.",0
"Because this is being argued as a free speech issue, the law falls under strict scrutiny, the highest level of scrutiny. That means there has to be great compelling interest by the state and the law has to be narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. Basically asserting the law has to be the best solution. To me it appears the judge is saying that to achieve this governmental interest, the law is too vague and overly-broad. It is very difficult for laws to pass the strict scrutiny muster.",0
Vague laws are bad no matter who introduces them. Particularly when those laws restrict freedoms granted by the first amendment.,0
It's very telling that banning sexually explicit material shown to children is seen as an attack on trans people. Makes you think.,0
You mean how children are exposed to places like hooters and even child pageants? Yet I see nobody trying to ban those.,0
To be fair this article is intentional with its wording. The ban would ban all the shows regardless of if the venue is responsible and not letting kids show up,0
Where are all these trans shows kids are being exposed to?,0
"We passed the inflection point pretty recently IMO. This most recent big push left in the culture war has been the step too far for pretty much every intelligent millennial I know.

No one is showing their junk smashed behind a thong. There's zero nudity. 

I'm pretty sure a lot of people here are confusing drag shows with burlesque shows. Drag shows have been innocently existing for generations. Clutch pearls over something that matters.",0

there's stuff i don't agree with in some of the things said but i mean you can learn so much about that world from hearing those peeps talk and this specific interview was incredible. i watched all 6 hours of it. this country has had/has some bad ass warriors man and getting to hear from them now through these sit downs has been awesome.",0

No-one would agree that pornography or extreme violence, or even religious books, should be forced or totally acceptable upon young children of the general population. So there's a widespread understanding that there is a limit. Well that limit is determined by the parents who send their kids to the schools, and the limit is different for every community the school serves.",0

"That depends entirely on what is being repressed.  Repressing at least some natural behavior and impulses is necessary in order to have a civil society.  You can see what happens, in say, San Francisco, when this breaks down.  Repressing the desire to commit violet acts is absolutely necessary.   Repressing children from eating all the candy they want and doing harmful things, like running out into a busy street is necessary.  I do not consider it repression to NOT expose young children to drag shows and other sexualized activities and material, even if you do.",0
Why are you defending the practice of grown men practicing their sexual fetish in front of kids often grinding their genitals inches from a kid's face? This used to be a very simple non-partisan issue: don't sexualize young kids. It is absurd that the left has championed behavior that should rightly get you thrown in jail.,0

"Yep, this judge is a dope. And from videos I've seen, these drag performances are almost always involving taking money from the audience, the same element every stripper literally employs in their shows.

""Someone showed me highly inflammatory videos to convince me that something I've never experienced is terrible and it worked!""  Good for you. 

These have been around since your grandpa was a lad. Your not curious at all how this became a HUGE threat to our children.... All of a sudden.... Even though no children have been hurt by this ever? The Catholic Church spent 60 million dollars in 2018 defending child rapists they had been protecting for decades..... But THIS, this is the actual threat. Give me a break.",0
"I‚Äôve met a kid that decidedly presents as trans. I‚Äôm talking 2-3 years old. This wasn‚Äôt the parents influence - the toys and clothes they had tried were enough evidence for me that this wasn‚Äôt them pushing it on the child. After a year of a child psychologist, they enrolled him into a pre school as a girl, psychologist talking to the caretakers and everything. Not the richest family around so this would have been not cheap for them.

It‚Äôs actually really scary how parents not ready for this suffer too. Trying your best doesn‚Äôt work when you‚Äôre trying in completely the wrong direction for what the child is interested in! I hope they continue to stick to their guns of letting the child grow up naturally rather than letting their kid get put on hormones at 7-8 years old. The kid was 4 when it was first brought up ffs.

The parents pushing it on their kids and the people doing it for clout seriously frustrate me as the reality of it is not as easygoing as its made out to be. ‚ÄúAccepting‚Äù it and actually doing what‚Äôs right are two separate things and its serious stress for a new family! Is encouraging it better or is being neutral about it better or should you push for more masculine traits slowly over time?

Watching this from the side gave me an easy set of views on ‚Äúis this really the case or is this the parent‚Äù - is it being celebrated or is it seen as an insane challenge? I‚Äôm not denying anyone not loving their children but stressing about the right thing isn‚Äôt needed when its under your guidance.",0
This is no different than not allowing children to do any other adult activity.,0
"Yes, which is why they chose to attack basic morality first.  There's no agreed basis on morality anymore because being moral, apparently, is having religion ""shoved down throats"".  This judge's ruling is basically suggesting that banning drag shows at schools is infringing on someone's rights.  Question is....whose?",0
"Which is fine for what they are!

I‚Äôm not against drag shows. Just against letting kids watch or be part of them.",0
"> Your not curious at all how this became a HUGE threat to our children.... All of a sudden....

I actually am curious why adults want to get their rocks off in front of children now.  My hypothesis is simple.  Because they feel emboldened by the left to keep pushing because the ""woke"" crowd is too scared to say anything and be cancelled.  

Have you seen the ""Desmond is amazing"" videos?  Do you also support female child beauty pageants?",0
"There are boys that are more into more traditionally girly toys at some point in their development.  That doesn't mean they aren't a boy.  Psychologically, it may be important for boys to have a doll at some point as we the importance it does have to girls, kids discover how they interact through play.

The psychologists probably have these parents scared to death, all they have to do is utter the phrase ""better a trans kid than a dead kid"", for which there is absolutely no proof that refusing to allow transition causes suicidal ideation, and the parents decided to start calling their son a girl.

There are masculine girls.  There are feminine boys.  There always have been.  Are we now to subject them all to brutal regimens of psychological treatment, and systematic mutilation through ""surgery"" and pharmaceutical compounds they must take for the rest of their life?  That's insanity. 

Further, opposing obvious sophistry is to become a villain in the eyes of the establishment.  The US government is trying to make it illegal to not ""affirm gender"", which is to say that the US government is requiring bad psychological and medical be the norm.",0
"Growing up, my dad brought me to the bar with him because we couldn't afford a babysitter. Whether or not you approve isn't the point, but that he made a parental decision. Same with rated R movies.

Exactly. I lived in Chicago near Andersonville where drag bars were a staple of the neighborhood there. Never cared to go to one and couldn't have cared less what those performances were doing. But then they had to involve kids and that was the defining line in speaking up against this overreach. I now live in TN and commend the actions they've taken to go against this perversion.,0
"This reply smacks of concern trolling. You are literally arguing that a parent should be able to expose young kids to sexual material in spite of the evidence that this is literally harmful to them. Here is a link to one such paper.

The state has a role in protecting children from basic harm such as sexual abuse, expose to drugs, and physical abuse.",0
Those laws already exist though. If a drag show is sexual and violates those laws then it should be reported like anything else. Making a new law that says all drag is sexual means people can be arrested based on what clothes they wear. New laws are not needed to keep kids away from sexual performances.,0

3) Finding ways to stop funding a radical left-wing agenda in our educational system.

He hit a nerve when he asked Bernie to be honest. That is absolutely not standard operating proceedure for Liberals.,0
Bernie Sander attacks all hardworking Americans just trying to make a living. He rather prefers distributing all resources like a communist.,0
"And that's the problems with a lot of Liberals these days. They only look at the bottom line of what these CEOs are making and are simply jealous of the wealth that they have. But they don't look at the fact that most of these people make that much because of the revenue that the company is bringing in under their leadership. If a company brings in millions of dollars, then the CEO should be compensated accordingly. And it is purely up to the company's leadership to say what compensation is appropriate for that position. It isn't up to the government, it isn't up to the public, or even the workers of the company.

There is absolutely no reason for anyone to dictate to a private company how much a CEO (or any position for that matter) makes or what their bonuses are.

I am proud to say that Mullin actually represents me in Congress. Unfortunately I can't say the same about the other Senator from my State of Oklahoma.",0
"That‚Äôs a crazy take. The entertainment industry and revenue generated from it have very little to do with creating jobs - that‚Äôs not the purpose of entertainment. On the other hand though, if you‚Äôre in the position of a CEO it is your responsibility to run your company in a way that makes money. That also creates jobs, but these jobs and companies are often exploring and extorting domestic people, and those over seas. Bernie‚Äôs take isn‚Äôt hypocritical. He made his money in office, honestly.",0

"Found the troll.

"I would rather be paid fairly for what I work for and then to actually keep what it is that I am paid for said work.

If I make a choice to be charitable, that is my own prerogative. But there's no reason at all to force someone to do that.",0

"We could invest in having actual trams and other public transportation, like other nations. I guess traffic is too important of an American tradition",0

"No thanks, the public transportation near me has constant robberies, assaults, and crazy homeless people urinating in it.",0
We don‚Äôt need cities anymore. That‚Äôs what we should *really* be talking about.,0
"Well, it really depends on where you are. If you‚Äôre in NYC or Chicago, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to own a car. Public transit there makes economic sense (I‚Äôm not even talking about the environment here). If you‚Äôre in a suburb that has like one bus every hour and then you have to walk a mile to even get to the bus stop, then of course you need a car.      

One‚Äôs decision of using a car or a train to go to work is independent of whether one‚Äôs a leftist or not. It does depend on where one lives though.",0
"You're completely ignoring the issue of safety, I dare anyone to ride Chicago public transit at night and then say its safe.",0
"Yeah it ain‚Äôt, but just like you‚Äôre likely to get mugged while waiting for your train, you could also get carjacked as you walk into a parking lot at night.    

Chicago is unsafe but that doesn‚Äôt mean the concept of public transit in a high population density city sucks. In New York City, London, Paris, Mumbai, Shanghai, Madrid etc we have a million plus commuters who want to leave their homes and go a few miles away to their offices. If they all drove their own cars, it won‚Äôt make sense. Again, ignore the environmental impact but what about congestion on the road? You‚Äôd spend hours in standstill traffic.    

Public transit makes sense where it is needed. Chicago is a poorly governed city of late but that is a reflection on the DAs, the mayor, the justice system etc, not on the concept of public transit.     

Of course, similarly, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to spend money on building train tracks for commuter transit in rural Pennsylvania for the tiny population that wants to go from point A to point B daily. They can drive.",0

Is the suggestion that the federal government should provide this security?  Then I‚Äôd say no,0
I don‚Äôt understand why this hasn‚Äôt been done long ago‚Ä¶ oh wait it‚Äôs an actual solution that‚Äôs why.,0
"Hey, why not every school? Have a vet stand guard. Have them go through a background and mental health check before and have them act as an extra SRO",0
"My church has armed guards and a uniformed officer on site on Sundays.  Our local public school has single-point entry w/ reinforced glass doors.  I wish the school had an armed resource officer.

Armed security and basic building security is actually quite attainable.  The schools front doors look very similar to regular glass doors.  They're slightly heavier and always want to latch closed on their own.  But I guess they can resist sustained rifle fire for a few minutes.  The school has two sets, doubling the protection.  Our town police department has dedicated patrol for the schools during their hours, and I guess their typical response time is like 90 to 120 seconds.

I feel like that needs to be the benchmark.
1. Single-point entry w/ all other doors securely locked during school hours.  
2. All doors capable of resisting rifle fire for a few minutes.
3. Armed resource officers, or at least dedicated police less than two minutes away.
4. Video monitored, dedicated security controlling access during school hours.

I'm open to other suggestions.  The above security hardly makes schools into ""prisons"".",0
I agree.  Private schools should be able to secure themselves as they seem fit.  Government to be honest shouldn‚Äôt even set guidelines as that will just give an excuse to govern them.,0
"Optics. Generally you want to send your kids to places that don't need security. 

Security guards increase perception of the lack of safety, for parents and kids alike.",0
"That makes no sense. Why would someone not want their kid to go to somewhere secure? This just proves my point, no one wants an actual solution because anyone with a functioning brain knows banning specific guns won‚Äôt do shit to fix the problem. And now we got people worried about ‚Äúoptics‚Äù of simply adding extra security. So the cycle of shooting occurs -> blame the other side -> do nothing until next shooting will repeat endlessly.",0
Well that‚Äôs the difference between feeling safe and being safe,0
"They do want their kid to go somewhere secure. A security guard says ""not secure"" to them. A security guard says ""bad enough shit has happened here before"". It's a psychological thing. And let's face it, police and security guards don't have a great reputation in many places in the U.S. right now, either. School shootings have also occurred despite security guards being present.

While it's possible they would make schools more secure overall, the optics make the politics an obstacle. That's why it hasn't been done(on a broader scale). If it gets done successfully at a school that could help, but the problem is success is pretty much invisible until a security guard happens to stop a potential school shooter.",0
"His record was good until march 2020? See, I don‚Äôt necessarily disagree or agree, but these articles are absurd. There‚Äôs no primary happening right now. Why so many can‚Äôt seem to see through what this is is startling. This is another team‚Äôs playbook.",0

I remember finding a letter from an ex-cult member who was upset about contracting an incurable STD after escaping the cult because she had managed to stay clean after all those years of having sex with different men in the cult.

Postmodernism doesn't put a lot of value in Rules and Systems after all, and are a lot more The Ends Justify The Means.  And once power is acquired, do whatever is necessary to maintain it, which seems like a total reversal but is actually very in keeping with the philosophical underpinnings.

> ‚ÄúWhen I am Weaker Than You, I ask you for Freedom because that is according to your principles; when I am Stronger than you, I take away your Freedom Because that is according to my principles.‚Äù

> - Frank Herbert

Classical liberals (aka conservatives....well some conservatives) put a lot more value on Systems themselves and so grit their teeth and grumbled a lot but accepted the legal losses and tried to work out a compromise (for all the good that did them), leading to the slow march towards we see now.  Its a conflict between philosophies that view rules as a tool to an end vs viewing rules as the end themselves.

Also the old censorship wasn't monolithcally conservative as you were lead to believe, such as some of the leading voices against the violence in rap music in the 90s were......Tipper Gore and Hillary Clinton.  Joe Lieberman was one of the loudest gavel-thumpers about violent video games.  And Janet Reno rose to fame prosecuting the 'daycare satanists' in the 80s.  Historical revisionism is handy when you control the institutions of popular memory.",0
"Free speech is always more important to those with minority or dissenting opinions.  Right now the Left strongly controls public discourse and heavily push their preferred narratives.

Because those in power always want to limit it.",0
Dunno; why do leftists keep shutting down those that disagree with them?,0
"Technically speaking, the political compass does a pretty good job of explaining; the vast majority of conservatives in Canada and the USA are quite libertarian (more freedom/less regulation, smaller government, liberty, freedom of thought/speech/expression, less censorship, etc) which has been quite prosperous, as opposed to the left which seems to be shifting more and more towards authoritarianism as they continue to try and *force* their beliefs upon other people and ultimately want to control you (example: Canada, my home and native land). This has led to nothing but failure as you‚Äôre giving way too much power to people who can‚Äôt be trusted with it. 

American conservatives seem to strongly value the Constitution that founded the nation and made it successful, and the Constitution was written by people that clearly had libertarian values (after all, they were trying to form their own nation and make it significantly different than Britain who they separated from.

The ‚Äúliberals‚Äù and ‚Äúleftists‚Äù are in the authoritarian-left category of the political compass whereas conservatives are in the libertarian-right.

"It was not some sort of collective intentional decision, more of cultural shifts. Free speech also means different things to different left and different right

Oversimplifying a bunch of things in the mix for some degree of brevity, and I'll attempt some order but it won't be a neat timeline due to so many things overlapping -

* Libertarian right tends to think marketplace dynamics lead the best outcomes, and freedom of speech as analogous to a marketplace of ideas. 
* Socialist and progressive left does not consider marketplace dynamics conducive to generating the best outcomes. 
* Liberal left is closer to libertarians, but with more reservations.
* Left is generally more sensitive to speech purportedly demonizing minority groups, broadly considering more forms of speech harmful of this category.

--
* What kinds of contexts freedom of speech ought to apply to, and to what extent, is broadly disputed.
* Freedom to manage private associations depends on capacity of communities to police members speech, and reject members on basis of it.
* Anti-discrimination tends to conflict with freedom of association in many contexts, and certain kinds of speech can be a basis for discrimination.
* Religious right was considerably more interesting in censorship of certain forms of publicly available content.
* The left tended to include people who were inclined to express speech contents the religious right found objectionable.

--
* 80s happened, and the religiosity of the right declined significantly while libertarian ideologies mixed more with other forms of conservatism. 
* The internet happened, and political discourse began moving increasingly online, despite much of it being technically in private spaces it was effectively public.
* Online content was a gray area regards companies being responsible for content put on their sites by users, which would become a liability.
* Online content was generally not very regulated, and was curated more by algorithms than people, those algorithms favoring content that was provocative.
* Political vitriol was generally increasing in politics, online and off, and political advertisement and propaganda online expanded into many big forum spaces.

--
* Socialist and progressive left had begun to dominate youth culture more than ever before, which ended up influencing the way companies navigated this.
* A handful of major conservative figures had found ways to appeal to youth online, while facebook was relatively good in terms of reaching older people.
* MAGA events lead to a dramatic increase in scrutiny of online content and censorship, undermining to some extent conservative online movements.
* Generally speaking, more right wing political content producers ended up attracting negative attention, on top of fears of foreign propaganda growing.
* Big tech companies found themselves at the center of these political tensions and catching the attention of the government and public, siding with the left/youth.

--
* Younger generations were very frustrated with politics, with relatively little power over traditional political institutions.
* MeToo movement made one form of power youth had clear - to affect cultural instead of institutional change by assassinating people's character online.
* Freedom to not associate with the right, and the ability to affect politics by online movements becomes a key part of their toolkit.
* Younger left are now far less positive toward free speech, and view cancel culture more as consequence culture.
* The right is aware they're failing in terms of youth appeal, hence the culture war dynamics moving toward education issues as well as the internet.




All these dynamics and more contributed to changes in different right and left leaning groups of people over time. I don't think you can narrow it down to single factor, and if you lump all the right and all the left into two big camps they will each seem to have contradictory views, but they really each break down into several smaller camps, even beyond the bigger ones I mentioned.",0

"They're only considered more of a right-wing thing to the right wing. As is the case with many terms in politics, the right and the left argue about the same term using different definitions.

The right lumps all issues related to ""I can't say X"" into free speech. This means they consider things like getting banned on social media or ""canceled"" by a business as things that have to do with free speech.

The left specifically refers to the constitutional right to free speech. If the \*government\* punishes you for your speech, that's a violation of free speech.

Both sides believe they are better for free speech. Both sides are probably right based on their definitions.",0
Well said,0
That reallybl sucks. I hope once conservatives get back in power we champion free speech as much as we do right now.,0
Well said and unfortunately true. We have become what they claimed they used to be.,0

If by some unlikely scenario he wins the nomination I'd probably vote for him over Biden, but I feel like Desantis and Trump are the two main competitors, and the fact that Vivek is a Hindu is probably going to stir up the evangelical vote a bit while they probably wouldn't otherwise be concerned with him. Plus his biotech background is probably ripe for controversy.

That being said I do think an asian republican president would probably do really well if Trump retired from politics, especially if they can connect with a rural vote in a way that the democrats couldn't.",0

Overall though, I don't think he's offering much other than platitudes, not really impressed when I look into the guy beyond the PR stuff.",0
"Yeah.  While I don't think Presidents need to be lifetime politicians, I'd like some sort of government experience out of the leader of the most powerful country on the planet.  Its the hardest job there is.  Go be governor or even be in Congress for a term.  Something.",0
"I think he's a great choice now, I feel he has something to offer, that no one else can. He understands the source of the corruption goes beyond the deep state and in order to rein in the government, you first have to rein in the asset managers that own our congressmen. BlackRock alone has 2 trillion in assets, they have complete control over corporate America and DC. Vivek is a bright guy and it's going to take intelligence and determination to dismantle the corrupt bureaucracies that are harming America.",0
Got a quality list?,0
"I do like DeSantis, he's very likeable with a solid track record as Chief Executive; however, Ron would be my second choice after Vivek. I just feel like we're at a crucial time and there are deep problems that haven't been addressed and I feel like they're so deeply imbedded in our system, it's going to take a person like Vivek to correct them, because they're very complex issues. We have to not only save our Republic from these people, we have to save capitalism, because the left is corrupting it and weaponizing it against our conservative values.",0
No Thx. He is back by the Bush family. I like him where he‚Äôs at,0
"I know for many people, Vivek Ramaswamy is someone that just popped up, but for those of us that have followed him for years, first as an entrepreneur, then as an author, we know that he's a genuine guy and his crusade against the woke Left and the destructive ideology that's tearing our country apart, is very much a personal crusade for him. In my opinion he has unique qualifications that make him a very interesting candidate.

This Jordan Peterson interview is a [fantastic interview](https://youtu.be/JX9B5tnj-xI)

Everything he's now talking about, he's been talking about for years, none of it just popped up, he's been preaching these ideas for some time now and many of his ideas have been parroted by both Trump and DeSantis.

"The three running, plus at least 3 governors (Abbot, Noem and Youngkin) plus Pompeo, heck I'd even through Kayleigh McEnany in the hat for a VP spot.

"Good point. The thing is Desantis has actually put a lot of things into action which a lot of other people envy when associating their own politicians. We will see when election season comes along. What we need is a coherent front runner for once, left and right included, with real leadership qualities who can speak intelligently. Trump, Biden, Hillary were all just brainless mouthpieces.",0
And he's just as bad. He looses everytime there is pushback. It's all show.,0

"What process? ESGs? He wrote WSJ opinion that all that needs to be done is make their ESG commitments transparent, admitting this is already occurring through regulatory and investor pressures. A far cry from his campaign rhetoric. 

Wokeness in general? What is his grand plan to stop it, really? Going after ESG corporations? They mostly DNGAF but are responding to cultural pressures that aren't going to be ended by technocratic changes.

There's a lot of grandiose promises but I'm not finding much concrete information that shows a path to achieving anything significant. His campaign site is remarkably barren of policy. 

Preaching the standard culture war stuff is not enough, the republican party's actual voters, despite their electoral college advantages, are in decline. Riling up a shrinking base with the same story with new actors isn't going to cut it for much longer.",0

"You're right about that, DeSantis has implemented some great policies and believe it or not, most of them originated with Vivek. If you've ever read ""Woke, inc"" or ""Nation of Victims"" you would see, Vivek was talking about this stuff long before it was on anyone else's radar.

"When Vivek was 25 he won a scholarship that was funded by Paul Soros. Vivek literally has no connection with George Soros or his family.

The Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans is a merit-based scholarship program for immigrants and the children of immigrants who are pursuing graduate or professional degrees in the United States.

Pre-hrt, I definitely had a physical advantage over the average woman. Yet after not even all too long on it, that advantage was more than gone as my Testosterone levels dropped slightly below healthy cisfem range. I'm 5'7"", 110lbs, and hauling around a ton of extra volume as body fat instead of muscle now, so there is absolutely no discernible advantage remaining. I'm probably even at a slight disadvantage to a similarly built cis woman because I haven't had nearly a full lifetime to get used to a drastically different body, and it's going to take a lot of reacclimation to be able push it to the same levels I did when playing various sports when younger. 

People try to cheat in sports frequently enough that it always has to be a concern, as fairness is essential to proper competition. Nobody's going to essentially chemically castrate themselves with hrt just to get into the women's league, but they sure as hell can just lie about their identity like this guy did to prove a point. Just can't start forming regulations around such necessities while also subsequently making it needlessly difficult to get on hrt for those who know what they're signing up for. Transgender sports leagues just aren't feasible either as there are very very few trans people (some people outright thinking it's like 20% of people when it's barely 1%) and outside of maybe some dense population centers, there wouldn't be the minimum population necessary to maintain enough membership.

That is why the Olympics, which has allowed transgender athletes since 2003, has rules for transgender athletes.

I'm asking for the definition of the word, not for the physical markers that people use to identify those who fit the definition. Certainly there is sometimes physical ambiguity that might result in what they would call mislabelling, but most people around the world are, in fact, concerned about the biological accuracy of the label.

More specifically, the overwhelming majority of cultures around the world are *highly* concerned with the biological implications of sex, specifically 1) the ability to produce offspring, and 2) the physical strengths and weaknesses that correspond to each sex.

The social roles that most cultures have adopted are almost entirely dependent on those biological capabilities, to the point that, whether for good or bad, the failure to meet those expectations is often met with negative social judgement.

So the definition that I've given you is, in fact, both incredibly practical *and* incredibly important in the overwhelming majority of cultures around the world.

This is exactly what will happen. The Dems set the precedent that it's fine to go after an ex president because you dislike them or their party and that becomes the new tradition.

That is something you cannot do with street drugs since every dose is different and non dependable.
  
I personally know a handful of people who got clean and are still clean after quitting street drugs and using medicinal drugs to finally get clean.

The increases in drug use, OD and homelessness has been increasing since before decriminalization, decriminalization just let people stop hiding. Maybe you should be asking yourself why people choose drugs over having a normal life and what could society have done better to change this.",0

Decriminalizing yes, but there still needs to be a consequence so society has a tool to affect change in it's addict population.",0

I get where you're coming from, and I agree that it's important for people to take responsibility for their own lives. But the reality is that not everyone has the same opportunities and resources to do that.

That's where government programs like the federal welfare system and federal school system come in.

"> Shouldn't it be the goal of every American to ensure the youth all get a fair and equitable start in life regardless of their zipcode?

No. It should be the goal of the parents of the child to instill in that child the work ethic and principles needed for that child to suceed at their goals.

That is a risk worth having since the reward for doing it right can be so great.",0

That's always been the case, throughout history.

>Some people are born into poverty and face systemic barriers that prevent them from succeeding, no matter how hard they work.

There *used* to be systemic barriers. Those ended in 1964 in America. How hard - and smart - you work can pay rewards. The three things every person needs to do prevent permanent poverty in America is (1) graduate high school, (2) don't have kids out of wedlock, (3) get a job and fight to keep it.   If you do these three things you are almost guaranteed not to remain in poverty all your life.
 
> That's where government programs like the federal welfare system and federal school system come in. They're designed to help level the playing field and give people a chance to succeed, regardless of their background. 

Except that this never happens. The government has been fighting a ""war on poverty"" since the 1960s and there are more poor people than ever. 

>It's not about handouts or entitlement, it's about creating a fair and just society where everyone has a shot at success. That's the American dream right?
 
It is 100% an entitlement. When multiple generations grow up in government housing projects subsisting on food stamps and welfare checks, you have no shot at anything. That is whole-heartedly NOT the American dream. Capt John Smith showed us this in the very beginnings of this country, how socialism and socialist programs don't work.

They are mostly run by government and unions. They don't have to be as long as government subsidies keep coming in. Also note the number of school boards fighting to have concerned parents labeled as ""terrorists"" so that they don't interfere with the poor schooling and indoctrination.

>Some schools in poor neighborhoods don't have the resources to provide a quality education, and that's not the fault of the parents or the kids.

No it is the fault of the national teacher's unions and the DoE. DoE and federal oversight should end and oversight/funding of schools should be returned to the states.

>By investing in the federal school system, we can ensure that every child, regardless of their zip code, has access to a quality education that will prepare them for success in life.

Alright, this will probably blow your mind, but here goes: Your child's education doesn't directly affect me or make my life better. When *I* go to school, then education directly benefits me. Someone else's education only benefits me or my neighbor in a vaugely tertiary degree, but it doesn't directly make my life better. That is why it is up to the family to instill the desire to learn and a work ethic so that a person will be bound and determined to improve *their own life*. The best schools in the world will not compel a lazy and unmotivated generation to bother to crack a book. Parents do that. Education happens in the home. School is just where the curriculm is presented and tested. Look no further than home-schooling to see how this works. I know several people that were home-schooled and they turned out to be fine, hard-working adults.
 
> I know you value hard work and self-reliance, and I do too. But we also have to acknowledge that sometimes people need a little help to get ahead, and that's where government programs can make a real difference. 

No, that's where private industry and religious groups and churches come in, just like they did before the welfare state. Yes there will be less welfare when private organizations do it. But that means they will prioritize the weak, sick and infirm first. If able-bodied people are left out because there is nothing left, well, too bad. Able bodied people should be working.

>We all benefit when everyone has a chance to succeed, and that's something we should all be able to agree on.

" 
I understand where you're coming from, and I agree that hard work and self-reliance are important values. But we also have to acknowledge that not everyone has the same opportunities and resources to succeed, especially if they were born into poverty or face systemic barriers. It's not about making excuses, it's just the reality for some people.

While it's true that systemic barriers were officially abolished in 1964 with the Civil Rights Act, the effects of centuries of discrimination and inequality are still present today. That's where government programs like the federal welfare system and federal school system come in. They're designed to help level the playing field and give people a chance to succeed, regardless of their background. It's not about handouts or entitlement, it's about creating a fair and just society where everyone has a shot at success. That's what the American dream is all about, right?

I understand your concerns about the government's effectiveness in fighting poverty, but poverty is a complex issue that can't be solved overnight. it's true that there are still many people living in poverty, it's also true that government programs have helped millions of people get out of poverty and improve their lives.

Regarding schools, I agree that not all schools are created equal and that's a problem. But I don't think the solution is to simply leave it up to the states or private organizations. Investing in the federal school system is important because it ensures that every child, regardless of their zip code, has access to a quality education that will prepare them for success in life. And while a child's education may not directly affect you, we all benefit when everyone has the opportunity to succeed. When we have a well-educated workforce, we have a stronger economy and a better society for everyone. We also have less crime, less teen pregnancy, and lower poverty rates.

Ultimately, I think we all want the same thing: a fair and just society where everyone has a chance to succeed. While private industry and religious groups can certainly play a role in helping people in need, I don't think we can rely solely on them to solve these complex issues. Government programs have an important role to play in creating a safety net for those who need it, and in investing in the future of our country through education and other programs",0

Not that that means we should have vandalism,  just that each generation sees things differently, and should not be forced to continue to praise or idolise people just because the previous generations did.

There are exactly zero universally loved people. There is not a historical figure who didn't wrong other people or have some kind of character flaws or do something bad.

That's a broad generalisation, almost every man bar none previous to the last few generations were raging sexists and I'm not suggesting we tare down every statue of every man that died pre 1900s.

Yes, and virtually no one focuses on those kinds of flaws for historical figures because 1) there's no novelty or notoriety to it and 2) there's no benefit to focusing on it. History books don't say ""George Washington was pivotal to creating today's successful western hemisphere /*

We don't put an asterisk on MLK's speeches warning that he did some sketchy stuff. We don't put an asterisk on Da Vinci warning that was super whatever-ism and whatever-phobic.",0
">letting them form their own opinion.

Opinion about *what*...? 

Do you think history books are gossip rags? We learned about Gandhi because of the influence he had on human history, not to tout him as a hero. Saying, ""Yeah, he was great, but remember he was also a vegetarian so eeehhh."" Is bizarre.

There are billions of pedos and vegetarians throughout history you can point to and mock, but we don't make a habit of it because that isn't what learning history is about.",0
">It's called the statue destruction you previously agreed was a good point. That is evidence of the direct consequences of focusing on grievances every American saw with their own eyes. 

As I mentioned previously, we have no idea what the motivation was for the person who destroyed that atatue. It could have been a white leftist 20yo, it could have me a 30yo Indian immigrant with grievances against him, it could have been an arsehole teenager who thought it was funny. You have no evidence that connects the destruction of this statue to the teaching of history in this way.

I'm asking for academic papers that show the teaching of the bad side of historical figures leads to what you claim. I would be very interested to read them.

>Who cares? We're not arguing about whether or not Indians have conflicted opinions of ghandi, we're arguing about whether it's beneficial or not to focus on the flaws of historical figures rather that their accomplishments.

See my point above, the reason I mentioned some Indians disliking him was to point out it may have been Indians who destroyed the statue. Probably not, but it could have been.


>And now that I think of it, what is the point of teaching that? It seems as pointless as teaching that every man before 2000 was a sexist. We don't put an asterisk on MLK's speeches warning that he did some sketchy stuff. We don't put an asterisk on Da Vinci warning that was super whatever-ism and whatever-phobic.

Teaching children about the founding fathers' ownership of slaves is not meant to discredit their contributions to American history, but rather to provide a more complete and accurate understanding of the past. If you DONT teach it, you are lying by omission to the children you are teaching. Similarly, acknowledging Gandhi's flaws does not negate the positive impact he had on India's independence movement, but rather adds depth and complexity to his legacy.

if we only focus on the positive aspects of historical figures, we risk perpetuating harmful myths and ideologies. For example, if we only teach children about the founding fathers' accomplishments and ignore their ownership of slaves, we perpetuate the idea that slavery was not a major part of American history, when in fact it was a central pillar of the nation's economy for centuries. By ignoring this aspect of history, we risk perpetuating racism and other forms of discrimination.",0
"Take Washington as an example. Someone i was arguing with today on this subreddit questioned WHY exactly we teach that Washington had slaves. We teach that because he was a man that called for freedom for all, who founded this country on that principle yet owned hundreds of his fellow human beings. 

In ghandis case, he was a man who we teach as a principled and just person, whos integrity, dignity and his refusal to fight bought the largest empire the world had ever seen to its knees. His principles, the same ones we place him on a pedestal for, also included sleeping with little girls. When you look at it as part of the whole, its all important.",0

"Reminds me of one of my business classes where we talked about work place values.  Some people believe respect is earned where some people believe respect is given.

I‚Äôll treat everyone kindly but until you‚Äôve proven yourself to be useful, at least in a workplace setting, you‚Äôre essentially a warm body at that point in my world.  The LGTB community wants everyone to love them unconditionally but they haven‚Äôt proven to anyone as to why we should.  As far as I‚Äôm concerned they‚Äôre the kids in high school that no one wanted anything to do with because they served no value outside of creating problems for everyone and it‚Äôs transcended into adulthood except now they‚Äôve taken over the media portion of our country and everyone is just supposed to accept the circus lifestyle they‚Äôve created for themselves.",0

"That‚Äôs one of the biggest problems with this world rate now and what I believe is a major reason why so many kids are depressed, anxious etc 

And why some go down a path of isolation and radicalization.

People are taught from a young age that the world is all loving treat others how you wanna be treated, always treat people with respect.

Children think that respect is something that is passively given which it is in terms of basic passive human respect.

Like respecting someone‚Äôs space, right to privacy all that stuff just being a decent human.

Then there‚Äôs actual respect such as people wanting to be around you, people wanting to learn more about your ideals and so on.

There‚Äôs a difference between respect we‚Äôd all give one another as curtesy for being part of the same species, then there‚Äôs respecting somebody as a person by the conduct of there character.

We gotta stop teaching kids that everybody in this world is gonna care about them and respect them because it almost guarantees disappointment.

You have a whole generation of kids who think there always gonna have all the good stuff in life from people then they leave high school/ college lose most of there friends and become depressed.

Aside from kids knowing there family will always love an respect them, they should be taught everybody else in society doesn‚Äôt have to like or respect them.

Only through hard work and proving you‚Äôre a good reliable person will you then get the respect from society you want. 

Gotta teach them to build themselves up from what they are so they have a goal on who they wanna be

If you‚Äôre goal driven and focused on improving yourself the respect you crave comes from within and not from other people most of the time",0

Know your biases rather so that you can give people a fair chance. There‚Äôs never gong to be anyone without biases.

"I think generally the old phrase ""respect is given, trust is earned"" meant that common decency ""respect"" was given first, but if you abuse it nobody will trust you enough to even do that.  That trust is earned by also being decent and upstanding toward others.

Today respect seems to be taken as ""acceptance"", which isn't what common decency is.  Common decency being treated as a human with dignity, but that all hinges on you to an extent.  If people don't know you they should generally be courteous and treat you with a modicum of respect.

If you show yourself to be unworthy of such decency by your rancid behavior...well that's on you and I have no sympathy for what befalls you.",0

"No.

I think you may be confusing respect with politeness, and even still neither are owed.

Let me be very clear. Despite the fact that I may be a healthier person if I am polite before knowing you it is not an obligation. I would encourage people to be polite, but I will never demand it.

But respect is completely different. True, you may be wise to respect people upon first meeting them the same way you would respect a snake even before you know it is venomous, but that seems more like caution to me so I don't think ""respect"" is a fitting word. No you may have respect for a hero, or for authority, or for people who have done great things. You may have respect for your friends because you know who they are in their hearts, but these things are earned with the experience we have with the person.",0
Yeah the concept of basic respect is lost on these people. Why should I even have to be in the same room as a trans person. They make me uncomfortable! All this other bullshit so they can make up excuses to get rid of us and demonify us.,0
"I think you are confused on the words being used.

You may ""respect"" a person before you meet them the same way you would ""respect"" a snake before you know if it is venomous, but that is more like caution than respect.

Or rather you may feel obligated to be polite to someone simply because being impolite is considered a moral pitfall, but that's subjective and is a rule you've made for yourself, despite how wise it may be. Regardless, respectfulness and politeness are not the same thing.

It is difficult to define specifically but I think a good starting place is to say that respect is something that leaders have. If you respect someone you would follow them, and I hope you wouldn't follow people blindly.",0
Jesus may disagree,0
You mean your ideas of perversion and wickedness right? Because your beliefs are correct haha!,0

"On the contrary, I think you‚Äôre confused on those words.

I don‚Äôt use the word respect to mean fear, which would be a more appropriate word for your snake example.

I also don‚Äôt use respect to mean admire, which would be more appropriate for your leadership example.

When I say that human beings are deserving of basic respect and dignity, I am saying that I recognize and believe that all human beings are of equal innate value. The key operative word there is innate.

Sure, not everyone on the soccer team is equally skilled or contributes equally to the win or loss, but on a fundamental level, that doesn‚Äôt matter. Fundamentally, human beings are not to be valued for their instrumental utility, but for essentially being human.

No, this doesn‚Äôt mean everyone gets a trophy. In practical day to day worldly matters, we evaluate people based on outcomes, effort, growth, etc. All of those factors contribute to the added level of respect or dignity we place *on top* of the basic levels with which we already ought to treat everyone.

And no, I do not mean mere politeness, which is superficial, often insincere, and sometimes condescending.

I respect other people in part because they all have lives as rich and complex as my own, and I humbly accept that I do not have the capacity to fully and completely understand anyone. Yet, by striving to deepen my understanding, and accepting that life is about discovering truth, not mandating it, my appreciation and respect for people regardless of their station in life or particular attributes grows.",0
Respect used to be used more generally as a phrase that meant to give a certain amount of politeness and decency to a person you have never met because that is the mature way to act.  Mature people don't run around with paranoia or just trusting everyone willy nilly.

Declaring that people who have concerns over gender affirming care for kids (such as the effects of puberty blockers on kids, look up the case of Jazz Jennings, who is experiencing depression after transitioning for years because they did the surgeries way too soon) as hateful is not only hateful for you or others to do but it also makes people immediately discredit your arguments. 

Concern over the education and safety of kids should be more highlighted. Kids shouldn‚Äôt be coerced by radical activists masquerading as teachers to accept their ideologies. These ‚Äúteachers‚Äù need to stop pushing ideologies and either actually do their jobs or quit being a teacher.

Most people who are narcissists operate in conspiracy theories.  Everything is a scam.  Everything is an angle.  There are no honest people only people scamming other scammers.  Narcissism is about threat detection.  If a person disagrees with a narcissist, the narc immediately goes into hypervigilance about seeing how they might be attacked or diminished, and they immediately respond with attacks to delegitimize the other party -- like calling Hogg a ""shark"".

If you have no respect for other people's views and can't meet an opposing person on the merits of their facts, evidence, and reasoned opinions, then maybe it isn't that your arguments and views are wrong.  It's that you can't accept that people have motives that aren't the same as a scam or an ulterior motive.  A narcissist can't argue the facts/viewpoints, so as a defense mechanism to defend their ego, they just assassinate the messenger.

A person who lives through a 35 person assault and massacre is entitled to grieve on their terms and respond to a tragedy on their terms, \*not yours\*.

He's entitled to his viewpoints.  If you can't disagree with another person on the merits, the problem is you, not him and it has nothing to do with guns or the 2nd amendment.  It's that you can't accept someone has a different viewpoint.  And that's what some people might call cancel culture.",0

"There are many paths to follow when it comes to a criminal indictment of Biden: The Ashley Biden diary's salacious allegations, the influence peddling in foreign countries, the tax fraud... and that's just the start.

Unlike with Trump, it wouldn't take years of investigations to come up with anything, and there'd be no need to redefine terms of law or rely on criminal witnesses to bring him to court.",0

Trump never even took a payday as President. But here they are fretting over which pocket he took the money out of to pay a harlot.,0

I find it very difficult to believe, that over Trumps long career, with all those businesses, in all those countries, and all those contacts, that this instance is the only time he's done something illegal. How does he develop all that land without kickbacks to mobs, cartels, or foreign governments? More accurately, that this single instance to a porn star matters. What's next, a jaywalking charge?

But, if this is the direction we're going to go now, microscoping every transaction, would you actually believe that the current swamp of politician in service aren't dirty? Those extreme powers of observation seem to be used, only in certain situations when it's convenient.",0
"Sure, if they're criminals like the Bidens and Hillary lock them up. Lock up criminals in either party for that matter, they don't get to live off our tax dollars when they should be in prison.  I don't think Trump is one of those criminals and they indicted him because they've been going after him relentlessly for years and also so that any charges brought against actual criminal leftists will result in ""retaliation"" cries like I mentioned.",0

After he was voted out of office he tried to get the military to seize voting machines and they told him no. He tried to get the military to pull every American serviceman from Korea and Western Europe and was also told no. He tried to appoint a flunky as head of the FBI and was told the entire White House staff would resign. He tried to send VP Pence to Alaska so he wouldn't vote to certify the election.

">In some ways slow walking that isn‚Äôt the worst thing. 

I don't think they will be slow walking it.

Rather, they need to get these testimonies on record. Then they'll use whatever they collect from that to put some pressure on a couple of his minions to flip. Then they'll get them to testify again. Then they'll put more pressure on some of the minions. It is a recursive cycle.

They use mental gymnastics and gaslighting as a motivational tactic,1
They have nothing left and have gone this far in the cult so they are using manipulative rhetoric,1
"Because they all have a persecution complex, and believe this makes him more popular. If they cared about winning, they would find someone independents would vote for.",1
"If you see this (or want to see this) as a politically motivated attack, it becomes a galvanizing moment - your supporters are going to work harder to fight back against a corrupt, politically motivated DA and his persecution of your movement, while you can try to spin the ""Democrats use political power to silence opposition"" line to win over independents.  It's the same reason why they set up a house committee to investigate ""weaponization of big government,"" the line is that Republicans are a part of freedom, while Democrats are a party of corruption and abuse of power.  

And to be fair, there's a bit of a point there - there aren't too many people who were Trump supporters earlier this week who are just now thinking ""ooh, maybe this guy isn't too savory.""  The amount of support lost because of this is going to be much less than the fact that there's now a rallying point.  Even Desantis is supporting Trump on this by saying he won't go along with attempts to arrest him in Florida.",1
Because they think being a criminal and a disgusting human being are actually traits to strive for and considered leadership quality.,1
"I believe we don't know the full ramifications yet. Not many people rioting maybe too early.  The weekend is coming.  One thing I can say is NYC is the perfect place for the first indictment.

""The settlement was public record and was recognized by the appeals court that was handling the case at the time. So it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúhush money,‚Äù as a social media post claimed. Rather, the settlement didn‚Äôt prohibit Jones from talking publicly about the alleged incident, at all.""

Yup. at no point did Obama order his military to bomb civilians.,1
"I have to agree with you up to a point.  Yes, since the Korean War we haven't been in any justifiable ""police actions"" around the world. The Iran- Contra was a vile CIA operation.  We fought in the Kuwait war against Iraq as paid mercenaries for Kuwait, a supposed ""free"" country. And well you know we just kept the beat up until now.
At least Biden prefers to send money not soldiers.  That's OK for me.",1

"A) Cohen said that in TV interviews ‚Ä¶ under oath he said he did it on his own. 

That ruins his credibility and is perfectly reasonable, reasonable doubt. 

 B) I wasn‚Äôt even talking about flowers, I was talking about Lewinsky..

Morally that is worse than an affair years back.

He was a bad dude.,1
"And that was the end of Clinton, so what's your point? What just happened to Cuomo in NY? Why do you think I'm defending the immoral behavior of Clinton? I'm not, my point was it was different legally. There are now 34 charges against Trump. The jury will decide if they're legit. So be it. But given what we already know about Trump, defending him at all, regardless of conviction, is pathetic.",1

">In a ruling still under seal, the judge said Mike Pence must appear before a grand jury over conversations he had with Trump leading up to January 6, 2021.

Yep. This is a big deal. Now that the grand jury will be hearing from Trump's top advisors, Pence, and Trump's attorney, there is significant advantage for any of them who feel like they have exposure in the January 6th events to make a deal with DoJ.  

And with a large conspiracy like this, I'm sure their lawyers are telling them, the first ones to make a deal get the best deals.

From what little we've heard, it really does seem like Pence always resisted the notion of stealing the election with Trump's various coup schemes. So Pence won't have any reason to take the fifth. That has to scare the crap out of some of them.

That all being said, we are still likely months away from any indictments.",1
Treason investigations should be the biggest of his problems.,1
"I'm so - what is the word I'm looking for here? - grateful?

Disgraced one term former President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice)__ has been indicted. 

March 30, 2023 is a monumental day for many reasons.

Hallelujah!",1
"The narcissistic sociopath, __unhinged insurrectionist,__ and grifter (with a pronounced case of logorrhea) known as disgraced one term twice impeached former President Trump will get his comeuppance.

It's a long time coming, IMO.


>*For all the frenzy over a possible indictment of Donald Trump in a New York hush money case, the ex-president‚Äôs gravest legal issues, which are deepening by the day, may lie elsewhere.*


And? VP Pence has been avoiding his responsibilities - hearings, depositions and testimony - trying to stay out of it.

But he can't.

He __wrote a book!__

Part of the public domain - and consciousness!

So he *will be testifying.*


>*In an extraordinary development revealed on Tuesday, a federal judge opened the way to a former vice president testifying against the president he served. In a ruling still under seal, the judge said Mike Pence must appear before a grand jury over conversations he had with Trump leading up to January 6, 2021. Such an appearance would allow prosecutors to seek potentially damning evidence, under oath, about fierce pressure Trump imposed on Pence to thwart the transfer of power to President Joe Biden.*

Frankly? I don't care.

Any of disgraced one term twice impeached former President Trump's many crimes will do!

>*Three crushing legal blows against Trump and his lawyers in investigations conducted by special counsel Jack Smith threaten to expose with fresh clarity his conduct in the run up to the US Capitol insurrection and his hoarding of classified documents.*

The wheels of justice do turn slowly. But they are starting to turn.

IMO?

That's a wonderful thing for the USA and the planet.",1

"It's not cognitive dissonance. It's all part of an actual plan. The SBC and think-tanks have gamed it out and we are falling for it hook, line, and sinker.

"they did it within literal hours of it happening.   
From what I can gather, via BS I am seeing on the mainstream media posts on FB, gay/trans people are now behind every mass shooting that has ever happened and we must STOP THEM NOW!!!",1
One narrative I see from right wing outlets is he/they were suffering mental illnessüôÑ. This narrative of blaming the individual instead of the gun is common among right wing ploy. I also noticed the news uses the dead name of the shooter.  It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if something bad happened to the shooter at that school.,1
The left always brings up white shooters. Everytime there is a poc as the shooter silence. Why is that okay. Also I have been a paramedic for a major city in the northeast. There is at least one shooting and or stabbing a day,1
They're pro-gun control...specifically for minorities. I wonder why.,1
"It's not necessarily gun reform. It is deeper-seated than that. It's our culture that glamorizes and fetishizes firearms of all sorts. It also has roots in the way our culture isolates and marginalizes those who are different, and how that isolation can lead to social media echo chambers which trends toward extremist views, culminating in violent, suicidal actions.",1

"I live in Thailand.  The lion share of people give absolutely zero fucks on how a person identifies or who they love.  Everyone is busy with their own life so it's not much of an issue which is great because all the crazy shit going down in America just doesn't  relate here too much. One point in resolution is marriage rights which will be solved at some point in the near future. 

Here's an interesting rub. Recently there has been a western influenced push (and quickly kicked to the curb) that drag shows are demeaning to trans people. Keep in mind these are actually tourist family friendly shows and such that have been around many many years. Many are next level talent as well.

Idk, found it interesting that some in the western movement would take this route given it's a society that is pretty open to things. Seems the push was from angry woke tourists which isn't new, maybe culturally adapting was a challenge or they missed the fight in a place that really doesn't have one.  Some folks just don't want to be happy was my take away.",1

A simple question to ask yourself is ""who is doing the speech suppression?"" If it's a business or a group of volunteers suppressing speech of the speaker where they're voluntarily participating by choice, it's editing. If it's the government suppressing speech where the speaker has a right to speak, it's censorship. It's a simplification, but it will get you there 95% of the time.",1

I'm going to vote for clarity, transparency not someone who tries to froth potential voters into an irrational biased frenzy.

The spread of trump flags, thin blue line tshirts and Black Rifle coffee hoodies is just an outward sign of the tribalism that is taking hold of these people. The KKK is alive & thriving here, I hear the N word and other dehumanizing terms on a regular basis. Guns are at the top of most people's minds, it is nigh impossible to have a conversation without it soon becoming the topic. I deliver for  living, and the number of  Confederate flag stickers I see on people's cars as I drive around is just mind boggling! This is recent, like in the past year or so.  Don't get me started on the everyday homo- & trans- phobia & as the mother of a trans person I live in terror for her every time she leaves the house.

However, the issue with that is that republicans already want to get rid of Medicare anyways. Defunding their medicare programs would just give them an excuse to leave them in squalor, effectively eliminating them without having to face the political backlash of doing so, since they could just point to the federal government as the bad guy.

But beyond that, it'd require congress to pass a budget that changes the allocation of those funds or puts those stipulations into place. With the current republican House, I don't see something like that happening.",1

Edit: I feel I should add, though, that in terms of danger to society, the right is far far worse, as it results in actual death, poverty, and chaos; the primary cause of death for children in the USA is gun violence.

"I‚Äôm not sure how any reasonable person cannot understand exactly what she meant without putting almost any effort into thinking about it.

The right is much more toxic and insane. We all know that. But the left has people insane enough to believe that it‚Äôs acceptable for biological males to compete against biological females in organized athletics, despite the fact that biological females do not want this and that most people recognize it as absurdly unfair. Any reasonable person knows this without giving it much thought, yet there are leftists who will outrageously and idiotically accuse you of being transphobic or hateful if you write this fact in a public online space such as Reddit.

You also have catch-phrases like ‚Äúall cops are bad‚Äù that don‚Äôt do the left any favors. I‚Äôm not sure how closed-minded one has to be not to recognize the toxicity on both sides, but it definitely disturbs me when I see people *who aren‚Äôt right wing nut jobs* failing to grasp this basic truth.

It‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ some people are afraid to admit that there are insane, toxic people who are ruining society on both sides, as if that will lead to a false equivalency. No. Don‚Äôt worry about that. Everybody knows that the right is the side of absolute batshit insanity and stupidity and overwhelming hatred. But to pretend that the left doesn‚Äôt have some really psychotic shit going on at the same time‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs just ridiculous.

All that said, blurting out ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù is still a stupid thing to say, and it‚Äôs most often (but not always) misleading when someone says it.

"Let me ChatGPT that for you.  But watch.. when presented with facts and evidence, you will stick to your guns  and do exactly what i described‚Ä¶ In New York, the Reproductive Health Act (RHA) was signed into law on January 22, 2019. This law updated New York's previous abortion law, which had been in effect since 1970. Under the RHA, women have the right to access abortion up to 24 weeks of pregnancy for any reason, as long as the procedure is performed by a licensed healthcare provider.

After 24 weeks, abortions are only legal in New York if they are necessary to protect the woman's life or health or if the fetus is not viable. This is based on Section 2599-bb of the New York Public Health Law, which states:

""An abortion may be performed by a licensed, certified, or authorized practitioner within 24 weeks from the commencement of pregnancy, or there is an absence of fetal viability, or at any time when necessary to protect a patient's life or health.""

The law defines ""absence of fetal viability"" as a condition where ""an attending physician, after examining the patient and upon reasonable medical judgment, determines that the fetus is not viable."" This determination must be made in accordance with accepted medical standards and practices.

It's important to note that abortions after 24 weeks are rare and are only performed in cases where the woman's life or health is at risk or the fetus has a severe abnormality. Additionally, the RHA requires that such abortions be performed by licensed, qualified healthcare providers in a hospital, or a licensed and regulated outpatient clinic.

In summary, under New York law, women have the right to access abortion up to 24 weeks of pregnancy for any reason. After 24 weeks, abortions are only legal if they are necessary to protect the woman's life or health or if the fetus is not viable, and must be performed by licensed healthcare providers in accordance with accepted medical standards and practices.",1

If you or I had committed just one of the crimes that he's being accused of? We would be in handcuffs in front of a judge  with a lawyer, and we would have to answer for our crimes.

Do they need to re-write laws about Presidents or ex-Presidents who commit crimes?

Once he left the Presidency he became a *private citizen* and must be treated as such.

I've had some hope for DA Bragg and the NY charges, but now *that* seems to have gone cold, and I have not heard much to speak of about Georgia.

He has never been held accountable in his life. He has bribed, scared and just pushed his way through everything, *because he knows he can get away with it*.

If I sound alarmed and scared to death, it is because I am alarmed and scared to death.

All I can say is I really, really hope you are correct and I am wrong.",1

"They are actually trying to change the laws around the country so that DAs can be controlled and / or fired if they try to prosecute cases that the Republicans don't approve of.

The State of Georgia is right up there.

SB 92, which passed the Georgia Senate 32-24 on Thursday, would create a Prosecuting Attorneys Qualifications Commission composed of gubernatorial and legislative appointees empowered to ‚Äúdiscipline, remove, and cause involuntary retirement of appointed or elected district attorneys or solicitors-general‚Äù for ‚Äúmental or physical incapacity,‚Äù ‚Äúwillful misconduct in office,‚Äù or ‚Äúwillful and persistent failure to carry out duties.‚Äù*

That's just...

Unimaginable.

That it is actually happening.

All because disgraced one term former President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice)__ is a criminal.

And he is afraid.

Absolutely in the long run you are correct. I don't know if it will happen quite as soon as you think it will.

Your post is pretty spot on. Honestly the only way they can win is either through gerrymandering or having rulings done through the Supreme Court. I‚Äôd keep an eye on Republicans because their push with religious beliefs seem to be in overdrive.,1

Dec 20.‚ÄîAdolph Hitler, once the demigod of the reactionary extremists, was released on parole from imprisonment at Fortress Landsberg, Bavaria, today and immediately left in an auto for Munich. He looked a much sadder and wiser man today than last Spring when he, with Ludendorff and other radical extremists, appeared before a Munich court charged with conspiracy to overthrow the Goverment.

>His behavior during imprisonment convinced the authorities that, like his political organization, known as the V√∂lkischer, was no longer to be feared. It is believed he will retire to private life and return to Austria, the country of his birth.

The moment student debt became non-dischargeable debt in a bankruptcy, it magically went from ‚Äúrisk investing in no collateral borrowers on the basis of their future earnings‚Äù to ‚Äúsuper safe, investment grade debt‚Äù.

This magically meant I could bundle student loans into AAA+ rated debt instruments and use them as ‚Äúsafe as treasury bonds‚Äù collateral for riskier investments, like options or short positions.

People start thinking about maybe removing that discharge provision and all of a sudden the entire financial sector gets a margin call as the certainty on student debt disappears.

I think the Stormy Daniel case would be an easy case to pursue.

>*A Manhattan grand jury is deliberating if Trump should be charged over hush money payments he and his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, made to adult film star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. Daniels alleges she and Trump had an affair before he ran for president. Cohen has said the $130,000 payment to Daniels was an effort to block her from speaking out about it during Trump's campaign.*

I hate that anyone has to spend a single breath talking about twice impeached disgraced former President Trump. There are so many things that are hurting our communities, and there are so many beautifully esquisite things to celebrate. 

His negativity sucks up all of the oxygen wherever he goes.

>*Pence's early response suggests that despite the obvious rupture in his relationship with the former president, he will continue to pick and choose his fights. The strategy is also emblematic of the reality that any nominee that wants to usurp Trump will eventually have to woo away some of the former president's base.*

> I'd be interested in finding out who funds Claremont.

Me, too. If they‚Äôre nonprofit/501(c)4, they deserve to lose their tax exemption, big time. 

Claremont is sketchy af.

From the article: 

> The claims come from a database posted earlier this week by the Center for the American Way of Life, a project of the Claremont Institute. As Claremont put it in a Newsweek article introducing the database, ‚ÄúAmericans deserve to know who funded the BLM riots.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

> Ground zero for this is the allegation that SVB had donated over $73 million to the ‚ÄúBLM Movement & Related Causes.‚Äù 

> That struck me as quite a lot of money for a single company, even a large and profitable one, to give to any cause or even all causes. So I tried to find out where this factoid came from **and rapidly found my way to a Trumpist think tank**. 

> Perhaps not surprisingly, it‚Äôs a complete lie.

‚Ä¶

> But **I scanned through each one of them and found no reference to anything remotely backing up the claim**. The closest thing I found that bore any relationship to this number was a company newsletter which discusses ‚Äúreinvesting in low- and moderate-income (‚ÄòLMI‚Äô) communities‚Äù in California and Massachusetts.

‚Ä¶

> Yet another newsletter said that $1.2 million in the company‚Äôs charitable contributions in 2019 went to ‚Äúsupporting opportunities for diverse, emerging talent in innovation.‚Äù Since presumably that giving had something to do with Black people, let‚Äôs assume for the sake of conversation, as Claremont clearly does, that that‚Äôs ‚ÄúBLM.‚Äù Even if that‚Äôs true, **it still suggests a level of giving to anything related to diversity issues that is only a tiny fraction of the claimed $73 million number**.

> It‚Äôs hard to prove a negative. **I didn‚Äôt find anything to back up Claremont‚Äôs claim in any of the cited documents.**

‚Ä¶

> Then there‚Äôs Boeing‚Äôs $15.6 million to ‚ÄúBLM.‚Äù

> You can see the cited list of recipients here. The largest recipients include the **Seattle Children‚Äôs Hospital**, United Negro College Fund, **Chicago Urban League**, D.C. College Access Program and the Forum to Advance Minorities in Engineering, Inc. Again, you can see the full list here.

> Rather unbelievably **Claremont lists Bank of America as giving more than $18 billion to ‚ÄúBLM.‚Äù**

> Yes, billion.

> The cited documents appear to report **only $1.25 billion** and that appears to be almost entirely going to financing for housing and business development in minority communities. So this money **may** be targeting minority advancement, but its in the form of **loans** that BOA will get paid back for. **An apparently tiny fraction of that total (no specific numbers are cited) goes in grants to organizations like Asian Americans Advancing Justice, National Coalition for Asian Pacific American Community Development and The Leadership Conference Education Fund.**",1

Do you have an example?,1
"I didn‚Äôt say doesn‚Äôt want to.. I said doesn‚Äôt have control of platforms big enough to matter..

Banning books from grade school libraries is totally meaningless and a performative trap to get liberals to look like groomers.. and we are stupid enough to play along. 

A) No one uses libraries anymore lol, not even kids. Everyone has a phone and the internet. 

B) limiting information until your an adult is not the same thing as canceling adults.",1
20 years ago‚Ä¶ that is a fair example though,1
"Republicans have latched on to those fallacies and are making sure they stay relevant with the Lia Thomas stuff, drag story hour, medically transitioning kids, exc and making sure they stay front and center, specifically because they know that is one of the only area as where public opinion is on their side. 

In most liberal Internet forums you will be flamed for showing even Luke warm  support for Rowling, hell there was a big movement to boycott a video game based on the series.. no matter how little she actually had to do with the game.. 

For sure that is not mainstream liberals.. it is a fringe thing, which is exactly my point.",1
"That is not true‚Ä¶ 

In multiple different ways..

A) look up Rowling beliefs and the tweets that lead to the pushback.. the entire controversy is totally ridiculous and a witch hunt‚Ä¶ and the same goes for anyone else considered a terf as far as I have seen.. 

They do not oppose calling people the name or pronouns they want and are against discrimination in the workplace, classroom or courtroom, but they have spoken out against the concept that just identifying as a woman with zero attempt to actually medically transition is enough to allow people in women‚Äôs shelters, prisons, locker rooms and women‚Äôs sports..

Which I guarantee you is probably a hair left of the average American, and almost certainly where the average liberal is at. 

B) mention her online in any liberal spaces it is is likely to be a flame war .. people considered TERFs are literally getting death threats and being told they are not ‚Äúreal feminists ‚Äú by influencers all across the left.. when I would bet my paycheck almost no one has done any research into the controversy.",1
"I‚Äôm not talking about the right.. I could care less about the right in most cases..

"Agreed, and yet every liberal media source and lots 
 of politicians will go to bat for ‚Äúdrag story hour‚Äù , kids at drag shows and other fringe issues that probably won‚Äôt help anyone, but help the right cast us as groomers‚Ä¶ 

For sure the average democrat/liberal could care less, but they don‚Äôt get the press.",1
"JK Rowling and the vast majority of terfs s I understand it are not against trans people.. which is the fringe left wing claim‚Ä¶

The things terfs oppose are things the majority of Americans for sure but I would be the majority of liberals oppose as well‚Ä¶ 

So yes I do not expect canceling people for having the mainstream opinion to play well nationally. Lol


TERFs oppose trans women in women‚Äôs sports, transitioning kids and the full fledged considering them 100% real women.  

They do not oppose calling people the name and pronoun they present as and such..

That is almost certainly the mainstream position.",1
The OP seems to be obsessed with JK Rowling and public libraries.,1

"I see, so the victims of cancel culture aren‚Äôt necessarily the targets of cancellation but those who talk about them in any way besides critically. That‚Äôs a completely separate, but I suppose fair, point.

Vocal minorities sure are vocal, I‚Äôll give you that. Outside of the tumblrina blogosphere war zone, I can only give you anecdotally that Rowling‚Äôs products and franchise remain massively popular and profitable. Nobody in my real life has bitten my head off for buying the Hogwarts legacy videogame and my friends are pretty far left. Most people still separate art from artist, which is why people still listen to Michael Jackson songs.

But back to the point I made, the right can point to the left all day and yell ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù but it‚Äôs a massive case of pots describing kettles as black.",1

"What percentage of Americans still use libraries for books?? 

What percentage have walked into a library in the past year??

All of that stuff is a scam to get liberals to fight for drag story hour and such so they can better cast us as groomers, and we instantly take the bait with zero tangible win,",1
You could get the same book in 60 seconds on those phone‚Ä¶,1
"Oh no she has absolutely been targeted for cancellation, it just hasn‚Äôt worked.. 

You yourself are proof of that as you totally misrepresented the controversy because that is what you had heard, because it is that commonplace. 

Would the right cancel things if they had the ability?? 

ABSOLUTELY, historically 99% of all cancellations have been right wing, but not the last decade. They don‚Äôt run any relevant platform.",1
Am I incorrect?,1

"And canceling people rarely works. Hollywood is still putting Mel Gibson in movies despite his drunken antisemitic rant. And back to my comedian examples ‚Äî you get the loud ones screaming for deplatforming and they rarely get what they want. 

Conservatives have ONE big example to point at and that‚Äôs when Twitter deplatformed Trump (temporarily) because he was a public official spreading falsehoods that were actively threatening democracy. Otherwise it‚Äôs just bloggers and commenters getting mad, but the public figures they want to cancel for speech remain largely untouched.

So conservatives might not run most of the relevant media platforms, but the liberal-run ones are mostly loathe to use the power they have to deplatform.

So ultimately you‚Äôve got vocal minorities of two parties who wanna do a lot of shutting people down for saying stuff they find objectionable, and they‚Äôre both mostly unsuccessful.",1
"Absolutely‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not obsessed with anything. I‚Äôm a realist who doesn‚Äôt like losing over fringe nonsense by virtue signalers.

It is very easy math.. if conservatives want us to do something, it probably is not in our best interests. Duh. 

Conservatives want us to go to bat for kids at drag shows and Lia Thomas type nonsense specifically because they want to cast us as groomers, and we take the bait every single time.",1
ThT is not my question‚Ä¶ what percentage of Americans use them? Just roughly?,1
"Conservatives doing dumb stuff is a win for the left because it chases moderates left. Just like liberals doing dumb stuff chases moderates right. 

Trump was a win for us‚Ä¶ because he was constantly doing dumb stuff, and those who stuttered and made up ridiculous defenses also pushed moderates left..

Which is exactly what politicians and professionals stumbling and stuttering when asked ‚Äúwhat is a woman‚Äù are doing..

That is exactly what all the ‚Äúcis gender‚Äù stuff is doing , like there is any scenario where the average American swaps from saying male/female to saying ‚Äúcis gender male/female‚Ä¶ 

It shows a total lack of understanding how language works. 

A) people do not adopt something that is harder to say.. language evolves to have less syllables and things that are easier to say get adopted. 

B) the new word gets the modifier not the old word.. 

In Britain it is just the post office while in the US it is the US post office because the British post office came first.

I stand by my position that conservatives can claim ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù is a grave threat, and perhaps voters will believe them, but a) the threat they perceive has not manifested in any meaningful way, and b) its flagrantly hypocritical.",1

We do the exact opposite.. we highlight the BS half of us are not even on board with and don‚Äôt even mention the stuff where everyone agrees with us.  

But more fundamentally, imho we became the numerical majority because we were the logic and science faction while the conservatives were creationists, nor because of inclusivity. 

That said inclusivity is fine, unless it conflicts with reality logic or science. Then inclusivity loses..

"I cannot argue that things like that have been overdone.

I think one failing that both the left and right have is too much focus on peripheral issues, and I would call it *overcorrecting*.

I think, and I could be wrong, but I think what is going on with what I would call, for want of a better term, the cultural left, is that they have, with justification, seen how much people of colour, LGBTQ+, etc *have* been beaten down, and they want to make it right *yesterday*.",1

Not believing the principal‚Äôs reasons for their child‚Äôs failing grades, the parent stood up, and took a swing at the principal across the desk separating them.  The parent was the child‚Äôs mother.  Our daughter is no longer in the public education system.  Ask around‚Ä¶violence against teachers, principals, and other educational staff is escalating.  It‚Äôs one reason educational staff is leaving in droves.",1
"I think this post begs the question....what is the point of school?

At this point, it feels like school has nothing to do with an education needed to function in the real world as an adult. Instead schools are being used as a proxy for a culture war between parents who believe they have the right to raise their children with a certain worldview versus educators who believe it's their right to raise the children with their worldview. 

I dunno if I ever knew the point of school when I was in it. Looking at it from the outside now, I see the point even less.",1

i would think yes - - - https://www.usccr.gov/files/pubs/docs/08-17-Wisconsin-hate-crimes.pdf,1
"I haven't been following these incidents so I will speak generally about what I know regarding hate crimes. 

It's not just as clear cut as the public outcry stating it's a hate crime. Each state has different laws surrounding what is considered a hate crime. Federally there are laws that were passed, but, ultimately it comes down to two things:
1. Is it a ""hate crime"" as determined by that states specific law?
2. If the state decides it isn't a hate crime, will the FBI choose to investigate/take over the case?

Using the two items above:
1. WI does not recognize gender identity as a basis for a hate crime. It only covers sexual orientation.
2. As far I can tell from very limited research, the FBI has not yet decided to do anything on these incidents. However, there may be something happening that the public isn't aware of, or that I wasn't able to find in a cursory search.

Here are three good resources for researching the basics:
[Southern Poverty Law Center Hate Crime Laws Explained ](https://www.splcenter.org/news/2022/09/07/hate-crime-laws-timeline)

[US DOJ Learn about hate crimes](https://www.justice.gov/hatecrimes/learn-about-hate-crimes)

Edit for spelling and to separate links.",1
Exactly.,1
"Their point, I think, was more closer to because a person kills a man, doesn't mean they were misandrist. 

So here, maybe the fact that three transgender women were killed over 9 months is more a reflection of them living in a dangerous area with high crimerates, rather than transphobia specifically.",1
"It‚Äôs hard to tell how big an issue it is because of how small the population pool is. 

I just read that the number of homicides towards trans gender people ‚Äúdoubled in 4 years‚Äù from 2017-2021. But that was a jump from 27 to 56. 

I hear people in public discourse use words like ‚Äúgenocide‚Äù and ‚Äúholocaust,‚Äù which is at the very least misleading.",1
"It is important to note though that gender is not considered a factor in a hate crime. We could use those statistics to get a clearer view of this problem. If gender identity isn‚Äôt recorded in a homicide, and since there‚Äôs ultimately a low population of transgender people, it‚Äôs difficult to demonstrate with a number how bad the problem actually is.",1
"I used to consider Taibbi was an iconoclast, speaking truth to power. I followed him a lot during the Iraq War and all the boondoggles therein, one after another. 

But he's kind of now in the Glenn Greenwald mold where they thought tearing down toxic institutions meant they should assign equal amount of malfeasance to some on left. I'm certainly not saying there's nothing worthy of criticism on the left. There's plenty to go around. But he kind of went off the deep end.",1
The Twitter files are nothing burgers.,1
"The guy sounds like a bought off a-hole looking to sell controversy at the expense of his integrity. I think this sums it up nicely...

""At another point, Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) asked whether Taibbi had been provided records of the Trump White House asking Twitter to remove a tweet by model Chrissy Teigen, in which she called then-President Donald Trump a ‚Äúpussy ass bitch.‚Äù  
Taibbi began, ‚ÄúNo, but that‚Äôs probably because ... ‚Äù  
Connolly jumped in: ‚ÄúProbably because it didn‚Äôt confirm the bias that this is all about ... ‚Äòthe left‚Äô attempting to control content when in fact the evidence is the Trump White House most certainly attempted to control content on Twitter.‚Äù""",1
It‚Äôs all just another attempt for the right wing to get their base all riled up over nothing,1
"They guy that harangued the Biden campaign for requesting nude photos of his son be removed from Twitter as ‚Äúgovernment interference‚Äù (though, how? Biden held no position), while simultaneously not batting an eye that the actual POTUS requested and received removal of certain other posts? That guy?",1
"I wouldn't say he panders to the right, but he panders to the anti-left, which the right wing loves to throw their dark money propaganda dollars behind to prop up. This way, he has plausible deniability when the left accuses him of selling out.

Tim Pool

It's exhausting to see these people get so much undeserved attention when their grift is so transparent. It's almost becoming a parody of itself.",1
"""We"" generally try to avoid groupthink. I think that Taibbi loved the attention that muskrat gave him, said files are nothingburgers and Taibbi statement that he didnt believe there was government interference gets drownded out. At the hearing what we learned was that it was trump and admin censoring media, which we kind of knew already. I mean he had cell phones of Dem mocs children wiretapped and was always calling for censorship of tv shows he didnt like re SNL",1
Taibbi has been a Russian Asset all along.He speaks fluent Russuan.,1
Lot of right-wingers trolling today huh,1
The reps questioning him and the other one were painfully dumb as well. Wow,1
How did he go off the deepend? He is just reporting on things he thinks is in the public interest. Why does it matter which political party he exposes?,1
Exactly. They said they had so much stuff and they didn't look at it all.,1
"Well no, it's not about the party it's about the action being sanctioned by the government in general. Taibbi was exposing government requested, and bought, censorship involving true facts about the covid 19 vaccines. The pandemic may have started under Trump, but he was out of office before the vaccines became public.

I am a liberal, I am for free healthcare for all, living wages, unions, you name it. But these are facts about medicine being censored at the request of the government for money*. Flat out undeniable, I don't understand why my friends and fellow peers are defending this.

If thus was done by Trump I know all my friends would agree with me.

* Because you may not know the specifics if you didn't watch the hearing, I will provide you the context of the money given to Twitter. Government offered money to Twitter for their time to censor speech. Twitter initially denied the money because they knew, ""the money is a conflict of interest"". Those are Twitter's words. Twitter eventually accepted the money knowing that it was wrong to censor stories for money. This is literally the government paying Twitter to censor TRUE information about negative vaccine information. Their goal was to minimize vaccine hesitancy, but it's TRUE information they requested to be censored.",1
"Matt Taibbi is a liberal journalist. I understand that Republicans wanting to throw punches at democrats, but I don't understand why Democrat politicians were treating Taibbi so awfully and why people are defending that behavior.",1
"I disagree. I'm not a fan of some of those people, but they do bring up a good point of how not-left the left party is in America. In some ways, the Democratic party is right of the Republican party. Pro-war in ukrain, against the railway unions, pro outsourcing jobs to other countries. The party just doesn't stand for the everyday working person. 

I hear people constantly complain about the two party system in America, but people still don't like their own party criticized. That sort of team spirit only divides the country and solidifies this system because they fail to act against a party that betrays them. I do agree with Russell Brand, Matt Taibbi, Jimmy Dore when they say we have a one party system in America.",1
And entirely too many people arestil comfortable blasting embarrassing private photos,1
Yeah but Republicans suck anyway.,1
Is it really not that evident from his recent writings?,1
"Why do you keep focusing on ""liberal"" status? It's irrelevant. The issue was that he cherry picked the stories he wanted to ""expose."" Prove that quote is objective fact.",1
Matt Taibbi is a ‚Äújournalist‚Äù whose whole schtick is attacking democrats to empower republicans.,1
"Why does it matter that he's a ""liberal"" journalist?",1
How would you describe the right wing position on the 3 issues you mentioned?,1
Yeah and then fascist Karen's whine about classic books for children while that stuff is all over social media,1
Because for some reason it seems like a conservative view point to support him and I'm not a conservative. I'm trying to understand why it's this way. What is he saying that makes his view non liberal?,1
Exactly.,1
"I'm not talking about right wing. I'm talking about the failed representation of the left wing in this country

And republican have been surprisingly antiwar with regards to Ukraine. Much more so than the Democrats in Congress. Unfortunately",1
Consider three things: 1)this argument is completely unrelated to liberal va nom-liberal. It's not a policy discuss. 2)no one gets a free pass from scrutiny because the carry a similar political label 3)He's full of shit.,1
"My point is to beware of false equivalencies, which these people love to peddle in, and the right wing loves to prop up. They would have you believe there is no difference in voting R vs D when in fact, there is a lot of difference.

I can give you a long list of progressive accomplishment in the past 2 years under this administration. These accomplishments far outweigh whatever failed representation you believe is occurring, or these people would have you believe.

The right wing, or at least Trump, is happy to let Putin take over a sovereign country through violent means as part of a corridor of other countries that would lead to a lot of blood shed. To say that this position is anti-war lacks context.",1
"Absolutely not. To justify US involvement in this war lacks context. 

1. US backed a coup in 2014 to establish an anrirussian government.

2. East Ukraine is still pro Russian and people were prosecuted pretty hard for beinge Russian sympathizers. 

3. A sort of civil war erupted in eastern provinces of Ukrain that resulted in Ukrain bombing their own people.

4. This gave an excuse for Russia to ""defend"" those people. They started bombing antirussian areas in the region and arming civilian to revolt.

5. Russia then demanded that Ukrain let those provinces be independent, or Russia would put troops on the ground

6.Ukrain didn't want to lose the land people or natural resources of those provinces, so they continued their military intervention in the area, trying to hold onto its claims of the land.

7. Russia invades Ukraine under the guise of ""freeing prosecuted people"" and ""fighting Nazis."" There are nazi battalions in the Ukrainian army that have a history of nazi refugees from ww2. Not prevalent, but they exist, Azov Battalion is the usual example. Russia has held this position against Ukrain since the 2014 coup.

8. Ukrain enters peace talks with Russia

9. US and UK intervene in peace talks telling Zelensky they will fund him. Zelensky is also threatened by far-right extremists in his own government if he makes peace with russia.

10. US wrote blank check to Ukraine and sent equipment. Arms originally sent to Ukraine for their war somehow end up in terrorist hand in Denmark and the Congo. Ukrainian officials recently were caught taking some of this money for themselves.

Please tell me what I missed that justifies the US supporting Ukraine. Looks to me like we're a catalyst to conflict in the region. It's a continuation of the forever wars in the middle east wake up. Why do we care that Ukraine is being harrased by Russia, but nobody says a goddammit thing about the US bombing Yemen to help Saudi Arabia's Genocide.",1
"If you think parroting Putin‚Äôs (unfounded) claims and justifications for a clear and hostile invasion of Ukraine somehow makes other countries pro-war, then I don‚Äôt see how we‚Äôre ever going to agree. It‚Äôs probably not worth the time or effort by both parties, sorry.",1
"I'm not parroting ""claims."" I'm stating facts. All of that, until the last statement, is observed and proven fact. Other countries and the US ARE actively pro war. This was known and accepted before the Ukraine War. That's why we went warring on the Middle East. Russia AND America can both be in the wrong, and they both are. If you're not antiwar, you're not liberal. This conflict has killed so many people, from soldiers to civilians. It is going to leave Ukraine in absolute ruin and disrepair. For what? So Ukraine can hold on to two provinces that just wanted some autonomy.",1

"She wasn't disbarred because she didn't lie in court; rather, she only lied to the public. However, what makes her an even bigger piece of crap is the fact that she did it for personal gain. To top it off, she now claims she didn't ""lie"" but simply failed her duty of candor to the public. It seems that supporters of MAGA just can't resist being deceived.",1
Does censoring her actually do anything? Why not just disbar her?,1
Can‚Äôt we shut all these trumpers up.,1

I think in the current political environment, it is safe to say any politician has a hard on China will get elected, or the opposite any politician that is soft on China will not get elected, whether it is R or D. Profit-wise, you have competing powers between MIC (L-M, Raytheon, Boeing) and tech and trade (Apple, Amazon, Walmart), one side will profit from war (not necessarily direct war, just increasing tension will get them profit), and the other side will profit from more trades. Currently MIC prevails so the relationship checked out.",1
"Co-opetition. If you are a true liberal you will automatically separate the average hard working Chinese citizen from their  authoritarian ruler. Most have no choice similar to when Trump won with a popular vote minority in the US. So, different systems, same result. From that perspective it is much better to see China in general as a competitor and partner b2b and not as an enemy.",1
China is run by an authoritarian regime increasingly becoming more autocratic with Xi in charge.

"No, although Trump has stated repeatedly that he admires Xi, even moreso now that he's appointed himself ruler for life.",1
We should not go to war with them. At some point Xi will die and changes will happen in China.,1

So a beauty pageant is not like a drag show?!? 

So a drag show is not an cartoon version of a beauty pageant?!?!",1
"Sure .. there is nothing inherently sexual about a stripper, who doesn‚Äôt take her clothes off reading a age appropriate book either.. 

You still would have outrage about that too, because the reason she is there is because she has a sexual occupation and people are specifically targeting a sexual occupation to have ‚Äústripper story hour.‚Äù

Obviously we do not all agree kids shouldn‚Äôt be at adult drag shows or ‚Äúthe left‚Äù would concede the point and we would move on to issues that matter where we win..",1
"Well, what's ridiculous about the story hour?  That ""drag show"" isn't the same show that's put on in bars and strip clubs.  It's just a man dressed as (with exaggerated features) a woman doing the same story reading anyone else could do.  

Beauty pageants are simply not drag shows. Idk what more there is to say on that.  

I'm not saying it's a ""societal good,""  and I would push back against that claim, but as far as a performance goes, America should lean towards the freedom of expression here.  The only reason there is liberal defenses of it is because of the hyperbole by conservatives about ""grooming.""  

I was involved in a drag story hour in my city where conservative activists came from out of state to protest it outside of our library.  I think some amount of defense against that is warranted if we are to be consistent and defend expression even when we don't like it.",1

"Um, not really.

Why is it I never hear you people complaining about child beauty pageants which actually sexualize kids?",1
You've clearly never seen either.,1

I don't know. I'm not trying to be a downer. There are WAY more men who support reproductive rights now than there were ten years ago!

"If being septic is ""normal"" to you, then you might be a republican",1
"Ignoring the other comments, are you saying you understand that pregnancy is dangerous but women should just die anyway?",1
"No, you walnut. From the Legal Brief that is located IN THE ARTICLE:
 
Amanda was forced to wait until she was septic to receive abortion care, causing one of her fallopian tubes to become permanently closed. 

When Lauren M. learned one of her twins was not viable, she was forced to travel out of state for the abortion she needed to save her and her other baby‚Äôs life, who is due in several weeks. 

Lauren H. received a devastating fetal diagnosis two weeks after Roe was overturned, and in the chaos that followed, she was forced to travel to Seattle for an abortion. 

Pregnant again now, Lauren H. fears that Texas is not safe for her or her family. 

Anna was forced to fly across multiple states after her water broke, risking that she would go into labor or septic shock on the journey. 

Ashley had to travel out of state to for an abortion to save the life of one of her twins, and afterwards, fearful of documenting Ashley‚Äôs abortion, her Texas physician instead described her condition as ‚Äúvanishing twin syndrome.‚Äù",1
"Normal pregnancy can be dangerous.
It's also considered ""disability"" for F sake.",1

"I went through this last year before roe was overturned (but I also live in CA so I don‚Äôt think it would have affected my ability to get a d&c). 

I had a twin pregnancy that was not viable and the natural miscarriage didn‚Äôt complete so I continued bleeding (a lot) and cramping for 3 weeks. When I went to the doctor they said it was urgent to do a d&c that day because I was at risk of hemorrhaging or sepsis, so they canceled other people‚Äôs appointments in order to fit my d&c into their schedule that afternoon. 

I would not wish this on any person. The fact that these women had to wait, travel, and may suffer infertility due to this FUCKED reality these ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù nut jobs are forcing us all into is beyond words. These people are fucking sick. The GOP is a fucking cancer.",1
Hugs sister. I‚Äôm so thankful you had access to care. I hope you‚Äôre doing better now!,1

"So, McCarthy is colluding with Tucker Carlson (who was just exposed as lying to millions of his viewers in the Dominion voting machine case) to cover up the Jan 6th insurrection so the guy who started it, Trump, can win the presidency and try again...this includes downplaying attacks on the police during the riots...that's pretty fucked up.",1
Yeah because their farce is front page now. Cops escorted Jan 6th protesters. Whoops. Mistrials coming.,1
"If a cop helps you commit a crime, it‚Äôs still a crime. For example, if I decide to physically assault someone (without defense) and an on duty cop helps me, then I can still be charged with the crime. 

Spoiler alert: it‚Äôs been covered, many times, that some of the officers were helping the insurrectionists. This is not new to those of us that aren‚Äôt obsessed with YouTube, Parler, Fox News, newsmax, OAN. 

Trump did not pardon a single person that was charged with a Jan 6 crime, and he could have before leaving office. Why do you think that is? He pardoned 116 in January of 2021, and Inauguration Day was January 20th, he could have pardoned those that had been charged after Jan 6. He chose not to.",1
Dudes a trumper. He's lost on all of us.,1
"It‚Äôs not news to anyone paying attention. If you think Fox is one sided news but not MSNBC then there‚Äôs no point on having a conversation with you because you are already in the cult. You know nothing about me or what I watch.

"I read Fox News regularly, and I watch a variety of news outlets. I actually rarely watch msnbc. 

I don‚Äôt disagree with you that the cops should be charged too if they helped. I do disagree with you that they can‚Äôt be charged with trespassing if a cop helped. I‚Äôm an attorney, but what do I know? 

Also, again, if they didn‚Äôt do anything wrong why didn‚Äôt trump pardon them before he left office? He pardoned a lot of people in January.",1
"I didn‚Äôt say they can‚Äôt be charged, I said it makes a difference if cops escorted them. I am no fan of Trump and I don‚Äôt care what you do (I know smart and dumb attorneys, myself) or what you watch, I just don‚Äôt like people presuming I watch something that apparently you read‚Ä¶? Good for you, I guess?

I also didn‚Äôt say they did nothing wrong. I think they were dumb, but lead by police and I think they are also being held as political prisoners. I think a mistrial is coming when FBI and police were escorting and manipulating the crowd. The cops also killed someone Jan 6th.

I‚Äôm not going to go back and forth anymore. I just think the whole thing was a shame. When Antifa took over part of a town in Oregon, and killed many people, that was a ‚Äúsummer of love‚Äù but when some people were escorted by police around the capitol building, that was an ‚Äúinsurrection.‚Äù I just don‚Äôt understand that mentality.

interesting that AGs can't be sued for threatening anyone.  walgreens is just protecting their business interests.  and - well - the governor ought to not threaten either.,1
What is the real impact to Walgreens though?  I guess nobody really knows the scope of the state‚Äôs business dealings with Walgreens at this time.  The state will probably need to form a committee to review this and make a recommendation.,1
I‚Äôll still do business with them.,1
"Right, the market is there, only Walgreens refuses to serve it. If you don't believe in the free market, sell to the other states who also don't, like Florida.",1
"Either way, it's the right stance for the company.",1
We could probably get Michigan on board with that too!,1
"The state‚Äôs Medicaid and employee health insurance plans, for starters",1
"Interesting, that‚Äôs not a law. Free market implies that different entities can choose to do business with each other or not, so why would they have to do business? It‚Äôs not a threat, it‚Äôs a business decision, and Walgreens is not entitled to California‚Äôs business.",1
"Yeah freedom of association sure is interesting. It was so interesting that they put it in the first amendment of the bill of rights. Newsom is the chief executive of the state, he's governor, not AG.",1
Such is the danger of private enterprise getting in bed with governments in the first place.,1

Doesn't federal law supercede state law? Democrats should have passed some protections before the mercury brain mob took over,1
We are literally on a path with these pricks to tearing up the Constitution and returning to the resounding success we had under the Articles of Confederacy.,1
"From a strictly constitutional perspective, that is correct.",1
"So now we see why the Republicans want ""Small government""",1
Confederation* sorry,1
Prove it.,1
"‚ÄúArticle VI, Paragraph 2 of the U.S. Constitution is commonly referred to as the Supremacy Clause. It establishes that the federal constitution, and federal law generally, take precedence over state laws, and even state constitutions.‚Äù",1
"The federal government cannot commandeer the states. See the 10th amendment of the U.S. constitution (‚Äúthe powers not delegated to the US by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people‚Äù). 

The Supreme Court overturned roe which held abortion was an inalienable constitutional right. There is also no federal law (eg the ‚Äúto the people‚Äù part/elected members of congress have not passed a fed law stating abortion must be legal federally/in all states). 

Without a constitutional right or federal law, the states have the right to restrict access to this pill, regardless of fda approval. 

The federal government is allowed to dangle money to the states in exchange for the states doing what the feds want (like when they wanted the states to raise the drinking age to 21), but they cannot force the states to do thing unless there‚Äôs a federal law or constitutional right.

Personal take: overturning of roe was a fucking tragedy. Marijuana should be legal.",1
This is true but someone else pointed out to me that the statement is about the FDA not the FED. I could be wrong but I don‚Äôt think the FDA has that power.,1
"I see, the statement being about the FDA not the FED and the FDA doesn‚Äôt have that power.

The FED however can make it law which would supersede state law. 

Also I agree on Roe and Weed.",1
"The fda is a federal agency, within the department of health and human services. Fed agencies are under the executive branch. The executive branch can issue executive orders, but the legislature makes the laws. 

Congress (aka the legislature) passed a law that requires FDA approval of prescription drugs that are prescribed in the US. So, that‚Äôs where the FDA comes into play - without their approval, pharm companies can‚Äôt get their drugs on the mass market. 

So, you‚Äôre right. FDA approval does not mean the same thing as congress passing a law or a constitutional right.",1
"The FDA is established by the federal government and as such, is federal law. That‚Äôs how that works.",1
"Glad we can agree on something! :) I think we should learn more about this stuff in school. I did not know much about how government works until I went to law school. 

I know that‚Äôs the point of professional school, to learn more, but I went in with such little knowledge of how govt works that it was pathetic and I had a huge learning curve. 

I have to wonder if it‚Äôs on purpose they don‚Äôt teach us more about govt while we are in elementary school. The only class I remember that really delved into it was in high school, and it was only one course. Not enough imo.",1
The FDA isn‚Äôt law its an administration. The FDA by itself can‚Äôt override state law. Federal law can.,1

"You shouldn‚Äôt allow politics of any kind to affect your actual life. As long as a person is kind and considerate who they vote for doesn‚Äôt matter much to me, especially if it‚Äôs family.",1
"Yeah I mean, you pretty much have to disown anyone that doesn't sit on the same side of the aisle as you. Like, they need to know that your political views far outweight whatever relationship they've built with you over the course of however many years.",1
That's actually a great way to think of it!,1
"What's funny is even not knowing your reasons, it still is probably related. Fox News and other propaganda brainwash people regarding politics but it rarely stays just that, it always spills over. They   get people rage addicted and you'll see them become more like that in areas other than politics. The political brainwashing turns them into assholes, or brings out the asshole they were hiding.",1

So you would treat trans people the same as people suffering from schizophrenia and anorexia? You acknowledge this is a thing that exists, but don't believe they should be comforted. Do you think it is wrong for even adults to transition their gender? What do you think would be appropriate treatment to cure transgender people?

As it turns out, she was born intersex and the doctor removed the male organs thus turning the baby into a girl.

For people with gender dysphoria, they truly believe they are not their assigned gender. They don't just wake up one day and begin a gender transition program. They have to undergo considerable psychological & medical evaluations before any medical doctor will prescribe any treatment regimen. These are highly trained medical professionals evaluating each case performing the evaluations and subsequent treatment plan.

By turning gender dysphoria into a political issue, the harm to children with this disorder could possibly be self-inflicted harm that could result in death.

I wonder if you actually consider it a mental illness if people can just desist from it? People with gender dysphoria suffer from a high rate of suicide.

I think guns are fine, I personally love guns and would love to open carry. I definitely don‚Äôt think we should be allowed to open carry though.

The problem I and a lot of people actually have with guns is gun registration. For example a 13 year old buys a gun, who gets held as responsible? Only the 13 year old. 
Guns need to have a serial number, chip or some identifiers ideally on each part that can‚Äôt be removed so that someone could be held responsible if it ends up in the wrong hands. That‚Äôs all I really want.
For example Mexico has a major gun problem, well Mexico only has one gun store in the entire country. All their guns come from the USA illegally, and no one ever gets held responsible when those weapons are found used by criminals.

Also common sense is that more guns will equal more deaths and shootings, because verbal or physical altercations quickly lead to guns getting pulled and gets deadly when it would‚Äôve otherwise been a non lethal altercation. There are obviously countless examples of this and it‚Äôs common sense",1
"Good for you? I've lived in bad neighborhoods for a large part of my life and break-ins were very common. The world does not revolve around your curated bubble that will eventually pop. 

If you are not responsible enough to own a gun that is on YOU, not on everyone else. You don't have to take a gun with you, but you can use it to protect your home.",1
And hopefully the innocent person is the one committing the final violence.,1
Come on. This is about choice. I will not question someone‚Äôs personal choice to not own a gun. There can be many good personal and situational reasons not to. But I‚Äôll also not tolerate efforts to prevent those who do want to exercise the right from doing so.,1

DeSantis is playing a bigoted power move, but he isn‚Äôt turning Florida into an Eastern European questionable democracy. Not to defend him in any way, but Disney shouldn‚Äôt have been a self-governing district in the first place. The main reason they are anyway is to avoid taxation.

It's is true that some bills were removed from elementary schools and if that upsets you, do you actually know the content of the book and why they were removed?

It's actually the opposite. They needed to build giant infrastructure in a short span of time. If they didn't create their own area they would have bankrupt the surrounding communities. The people living around the park would have been on the hook for billions of dollars in bonding. Desantis realized this and totally changed his initial plan. When he was going to dissolve the district it would have landed giant costs on the surrounding communities - so instead he took over the board that runs the district.

"What you described is true for(a number) of conservative voters, but not current republican politicians. Theres a difference. Conservatives and republicans right now are not even close to being the same thing. Before 2020 there was still a couple conservative politicians left in the republican party who did genuinely want whats best for ppl and the country. Unfortunately since they had morals and a spine they spoke out against the big lie and after that ppl threatened their families until they decided to leave politics all together. There are still conservative voters who are good people and want whats best for the country and people but just have different ideas on how to get there vs liberals. These people have 0 representation in the current republican party today. Buut since we only have a 2 party system and they have voted R their whole life theyre just going with what they know, plus a lot of them arent aware of whats really going on due to the conservative media being captured by these same republican donors/elites/politicians. I think we all need to find a way to separate who were talking about when we talk about the dark turn the republican party has taken, because just because the party is trying to tear this country apart, theres a good amount of conservative voters left who just want whats best.

"I don‚Äôt live in a bubble, modern conservatism is more complicated than just ‚ÄúTrumpism.‚Äù In fact, a lot of the party voters prefer the policies of Trump, but not his personal actions. When I talk to conservative voters, they tend to talk about how they vote for a person right for the job, and when I talk to liberal voters they tend to talk about how much they like the person and who is the better perceived leader. They voted a half-dead person to office that called people fat, called people ‚Äúnot black‚Äù if they considered voting for Trump, shared a bank account with his son and bragged about getting people fired in other countries. Including his ties with Ukraine which may ignite WW3 if we aren‚Äôt careful, now that there‚Äôs rumors of Russia and China teaming up.

When Trump was President, I didn‚Äôt vote for him on 2016, but did in 2020. There was literal peace in the Middle East. No new wars. Economy was booming. Of course Trump was praised! His personal life and rhetoric is not always politically correct, but neither is it for most people in the actual country. While I think the President should be above that, I think you misunderstand if you think this is all about Trump. Conservatives were just as surprised when Trump got elected as Liberals were.",1

The increase was only meant to be temporary to build a cushion for the bulge of retiring Boomers. This increase ended a 'private savings function' for too many households.

That could mean the end of low tax rates for the Uber-Rich who have been reaching into the Treasury to take out money since Reagan.

 We should ALSO raise the income cap for how much income is subject to FICA withholding. This will make up for some of the reduced rates...$500K or a $1M of income should be paying in. My own druthers would be a cap based on multiples of the median household income. Thus, the cap would not need new legislation or regulation to change with the times.  


Also, we should eliminate the matching contribution for the self-employed (and only the self-employed) at 3X or 5X of the median income.  


Lastly, any changes should be 'stepped in' over 5-7 years so as not to shock the economy into recession and to permit assessment and re-evaluation of effectiveness.

"401k contributions get a tax break but 401k distributions are taxed as regular income.  In other words, you pay the tax later instead of now.

> Hello, I'm Aaron, a 16 y/o moderate conservative. I've not been into politics very long but I like to debate people with different views.

 Debate less given your nascent interest in politics and young age. Wisdom and understanding comes from *listening*, not from talking. You'd be better served to hear others and take in as many vantages as you can, as opposed to debating. Hear people out as opposed to trying to create a response; especially some sort of ""gotcha"" question. 

> ~~basic things I support are things like racial~~ equality, ~~same-sex marriages, and improvements to education and social security networks.~~

Those are all the same thing if we consider an approach to equality that is truly equitable for all. Consider your core beliefs, not individual nuances there of. You either accept that equality should be a core aspiration or you don't. Don't allow subsets of equality to be removed due to other forces. 

> On the other hand, I believe the second amendment shouldn't be repealed 

Good thing no one is attempting to do that, then. 

The better point is to understand the concept of the constitution as a *living document.* The second amendment was added at a later date upon considering contemporary realities and motivations. 

The best part about the constitution is this ability to change with the times. No one living in the 1700s could anticipate what life would be like in 2023. However, they could understand the need for self governance and changes in objective reality. 

Contemporarily there is an obvious and clear gun violence issue - from both individuals and the state. What should be done to address it is not a black and white answer. The point I'd drive home here is that amendments to the constitution are it's greatest feature and we should be open-minded and willing to consider the abilities to construct our laws to align with contemporary realities as opposed to considering them inflexible and infallible. 


> and things like illegal immigration should be looked at more seriously. 

No person is illegal. 

> I am pro-choice until a few weeks into pregnancy once the embryo begins to properly develope, which then I turn pro-life. 

Women may not even know they're pregnant at this point. 

We also must consider the rights of those women. 

We must also balance that with the religious freedoms you previously stated you endorse protection for carte blanche. As a member of the Satanic Temple, this religion states that ""One‚Äôs body is inviolable, subject to one‚Äôs own will alone."" Additionally TST does not endorse that life begins at conception, and further provided for a religious based abortion ritual. 

You either support religious freedom or you support religious freedoms for only those religions you subjectivelt approve of. 


> The most controversial opinion I have would probably be that I am against trans peoples, as the entire concept doesn't make sense in my eyes. 

Just because it doesn't make sense in your eyes doesn't mean that it should be allowed for people to have freedom and autonomy to make what choices they see best fit for their lives. Your opinion literally does not matter in restricting their freedoms to live as they choose to do. Believing that you have any right to interject, interfere with, or to even have your opinion considered as a part of controlling how they live is incredibly myopic and frankly arrogant. 

We do not govern, vote, or create laws for the purpose of making people live like we want them to or to force the world to align with how it ""makes sense in our eyes.""  We strive to Legilsate in a manner that provides for protection of freedoms of individuals to have autonomy over how they live.

If it doesn't make sense to you, that doesn't matter. That's an issue of you not being educated enough about the situation. You can be ignorant of it. You can not understand it. You can dislike it. But to state that you're *against* it as in supporting legislation to. Limit the freedom of transgendered individuals goes against your previous comments stating you support equality.  

We cannot support making individuals second class citizens just people we don't like what they're doing.

> Economically I lean further right than in most things. I believe federal spending should be cut down (See the United States massive debt issue) and in lowering taxes (Or at the very least, putting that money into something useful).

This is a much more complicated issue. It's not a left or right issue. Both sides in contemporary America encourage massive spending and engage in graft and corruption. 

> The biggest issue I believe in politics is the massive hypocrisies both sides make, and just how much hatred there is in the system. 

You literally said you're against trans people. That's pretty hateful. 

> A compromise is not a bad thing, no matter how hard radicals try to make it seem. 

There is no compromising on considering humans illegal or subject to limitation on their bodily autonomy. 

You have a lot of growing to do. 
Again, I'd suggest listening more and understanding your limitations given that you're so young. Critically think. Appraise underlying motives and the veracity of statements. Identity core beliefs and integrate your understanding of the world based upon those.

Similar thing with gun control in that it's probably the loudest of you all talking. I do agree with better regulation of firearms, but we don't exactly have access to military firearms. A gun sold at a gun shop is actually tuned back a bit.

Economic stuff, I agree. Taxes are inevitable but it's seeming more and more rare that it's put towards something useful. With how little the US really has to offer today you'd think tax wouldn't be so high.

It's one reddit post. You can't expect to figure out your conceptualization of the world and governance in one reddit post. Nor can you expect anyone to have to provide you compelling arguments. 

My comment was a blend of general overall recommendations to best serve you on this journey as well as some pushback against some of your more disturbing positions. 

My recommendation for listening isn't meant to be taken expressly literally. Listening also means considering a variety of modes for that input. Reading exposing yourself to new and different cultures. Conversations with people and I guess even yeah this Reddit post.

"Over and over again? Private individuals and numerous groups have filed lawsuits to protect voting rights. 

>*For decades, private individuals and groups, who did not represent the federal government, have filed the majority of Section 2 lawsuits that have stopped state and local governments from minimizing the political power of people of color through the redrawing of voting maps and other steps in the elections process. But that longstanding practice may be coming to an end.*

Why are private individuals not being allowed to protest and sue to fight for their rights like anyone else?

*""It keeps me up at night,"" says Doug Spencer, an associate professor of law at the University of Colorado, who tracks voting rights lawsuits and is concerned about the argument not to allow private individuals to sue under Section 2. ""If that process is taken off the table, then the protection of minority voting rights will be much weaker after that case than it was before,"" Spencer adds. ""This is one important thread that could unravel what remains of the Voting Rights Act.""*

One piece at a time? Voting rights are being destroyed all across America.

>*In the lawsuit, groups representing Black voters in Arkansas claim that Republican politicians on Arkansas' apportionment board had drawn a map of state House districts that dilutes the voting power of Black people, denying Black communities meaningful opportunities to elect representatives of their choice.*

Why is  SPOTUS seemingly supporting the dismanyling of viter rights?

>*Pam Karlan - a professor at Stanford University Law School who, before stepping down last year, helped lead the department's Civil Rights Division as the principal deputy assistant attorney general appointed by President Biden - says beyond limited resources, there's also the challenge of the ""sheer volume of jurisdictions in the United States that might face a Section 2 case.# ""There are states, counties, school boards, water districts, city councils. I mean, there are just so many different governmental bodies that are subject to Section 2 that the idea that you'd have one body in the Justice Department as the sole enforcement mechanism makes no sense at all,"" says Karlan, who declined to comment on why the DOJ decided not to take on the Arkansas case.*

How many districts (that have been redrawn) will need to file law suits to ensure their voting rights are protected?

And why deny the individuals (whose rights are being destroyed) the ability to pursue legal remedies to retain their voting rights?

>*""I think it's an open question only in the sense that no court has ever felt compelled to expressly say that people whose voting rights have been violated can sue under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act because everyone - and I do mean everyone - understood that that's what Congress meant,"" says Dan Tokaji, dean of the University of Wisconsin Law School, who has written about private individuals suing for violations of federal election laws.*

If we don't stand up now? And fight for the voting rights of all of us? Then they will be lost for all of us.

>*If the Arkansas lawsuit ultimately reaches the U.S. Supreme Court, it may join a list of cases that have resulted in a steady chipping away of Voting Rights Act protections by the conservative-majority court under Chief Justice John Roberts.*

If I‚Äôm incorrect, allow me to educate you a little. For starters, children aren‚Äôt getting any sort of ‚Äúmutilation‚Äù surgeries. They just aren‚Äôt. Regardless of whether that‚Äôs our business, anyway, it‚Äôs a non issue. The most common form of gender affirming care for children is social transitioning, where they do things like change their attire, take on a different name, assume different pronouns, get a different haircut, etc. That‚Äôs generally done before anything else at all. It‚Äôs a good way to test out and ensure they feel as comfortable in that new identity as they think they will.

The second step can be puberty blockers, which the effects, if you stop taking them, are almost always reversible. Normal puberty commences and everything adjusts as it would in any other child. 

In some extreme cases, the next step is hormonal treatment, where they start on the hormone that they want to transition to. However, this is never the first step, and there is always plenty of time to back out and ‚Äúdecide‚Äù if this is right for them. 

So stop using the word ‚Äúmutilation‚Äù‚Ä¶ at all. Those surgeries are legitimate gender affirming care and shouldn‚Äôt be called that in the first place, but additionally, it‚Äôs just not happening to children.",1
"As a liberal, I can say with 100 certainty that you do NOT understand transitioning.",1
"""I'm not against trans adults, I just think they're drastically and permanently mutilated""

Sure, bud",1
"As a liberal I‚Äôm sorry but I don‚Äôt care what your opinion is about someone else‚Äôs choices.  I‚Äôm sorry it makes you feel icky, but please kindly keep your opinions to yourself.  It‚Äôs not your place to criticize, and you‚Äôre functionally identical to a trump supporter in this moment.  Hope this helps!",1
I agree with you. Children need to be protected.,1
That sounds extremely rational. I wish you the best of luck with everything. Truly. I can‚Äôt imagine how difficult it must be to look in the mirror and see a different reflection then what you feel like.,1
"Thanks, I'm not suffering too badly right now as my family is eventually planning on letting me atleast socially transition soon (cutting my hair, going by a different name and pronouns, etc.)",1
Nowhere near enough to be in control.,1
Nonsense! All of us on Reddit are here to express our opinions. If you think people should be silenced then you‚Äôre as bad as DeSantis.,1

Trump's trip to Ohio was nothing more than his entire M.O.: A commercial for how great he is. -And Faux Nooz played it up. (at least he didn't throw any paper towels at them.),1

‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ but‚Ä¶ Trump flew to Ohio and then he took some people to McDonalds and handed out feee hats.‚Äù -village idiot.,1
Polls. Mean. Nothing.,1
"Biden is the current president, his standing is relevant to me. Trump is nobody, why are we still keeping tabs of his standing, unless anyone believe he has a snowballs chance in hell of winning in 2024?",1
His literal standing isn‚Äôt so good after his walk up the stairs the other day ;),1
I think it's worth following. Trump sliding in polls still has implications. It could mean that a more moderate Republican ends up winning the primary and actually ends up challenging Democrats.,1
"I think Biden should retire. He is getting to the point where his age could spoil the election. All it takes is one bad event, and Republicans win. I hate to sound ageist, and I truly think Biden has done a fantastic job in an office, but politics is a nasty game. It's all about winning at any cost, and our fundamental rights and freedoms are at stake.

Also, I am fully confident that, if given the chance, the party can coalesce around a young candidate with new and progressive ideas. Nobody was talking about Obama in early 2006, but then look what happened.",1
That's great. Tell the news media to stop covering him.,1
"He still has a big following and it doesn't matter if he doesn't gain any votes. If he's the presidential nominee for the GOP all it takes is for democrats to not show up to vote for him to win.

I don't understand how people don't understand how he's still a threat",1
"People need to start ignoring MTG, not posting her absurd, publicity-seeking garbage statements. She's trying to gain recognition as Trump did, by outrageous blather.",1
I think we all thought this in 2016 though,1
It would be nice if we could just ignore him and he would just go away like the monster under bed but that‚Äôs not gonna happen. Hopefully a Big Mac or a bucket or KFC will make him go away.,1
"Lets say that the Vegas odds matter more than actual polls, since those betting odds are literally people putting their money where there mouth is.

According to Vegas odds at this exact moment both Trump and DeSantis have better odds than Biden.

So yea I'd say Trump still matters.",1
"The fact that he still occupies so much head space in so many people still boggles my mind. Can we let the dude fade away already, over it.",1
Amen. If we‚Äôd only been allowed to ignore his grift in 2015 we‚Äôd have been better off.,1
"thats a fair point that Trumps fan base is as big as it can get in fact its only going to get smaller as older Republicans die out and young people become 18 (young people being more likely to be liberal and old people being more likely conservative) unfortunately the republican party needs trumps zealots in order to just remain on the surface if they lost them their support would be so small the democrats would start skipping away with national level elections, which is why media especially right wing media won't shut up whenever he farts",1
Research will indicate otherwise.,1
Free wall-to-wall news coverage every time he cuts a fart. He‚Äôs a goddamn media ecosystem. And they‚Äôre gonna shove him down our throats and up our asses until he‚Äôs dead.,1
"Ok sounds good, thanks",1
You'll eat these words. Sounds like wishful thinking to me. Trump is like a hemorrhoid that never goes away.,1
"I am over 18 and voted for Trump in 2020. I think the country would have been better off than it was with Biden.

If anyone would like me to go into detail, I can. Any subject I can tell you, as an independent, I was impressed with him (though I will admit I don‚Äôt get my news from MSNBC or Fox‚Ä¶ I watch biased sources from the left and right so I know what the source prefers, and don‚Äôt rush to judgement easily).",1
"Where did you get your data from? Trump supporters are like zealots, they don‚Äôt waver. Unfortunately, my best friend is one and I know firsthand.",1
We were all saying that in 2016.  He‚Äôs an idiot. Ignore him. Focus on the real possible candidates and the threats they pose.,1
"OP.  Serious question.  Why do you even bring him up?   You're literally making people pay attention to him.    Like the South Park joke on Harry and Megan... ""We Want Our Privacy"" World Tour.  

That's you with Trump.  Waving a big ol' Trump sign around.  Why?",1
If trump didn‚Äôt matter you wouldn‚Äôt be making a post about him .,1
"71 million people voted for him in 2020 and if they did it then, they'll do it again. Every last one.",1
"Trump is their money maker. Trump gets them clicks and eyeballs. They will never stop covering him. This goes for all news networks liberal, conservative, whatever.",1
"Right, like the person who posted.",1
I agree.  71 million voted for POS.  What's scary is how many more million that didn't vote think like he does.,1
"Yeah but even Republicans are giving her side eye these days. Ranting about Jewish space lasers is a bad look. It's not like Republicans will ever hold their side accountable, though.",1
"And 2020, I couldn't imagine how anybody who didn't vote for him in 2016 would in 2020. Plenty of places where he gained vote share and he received millions more total votes.",1
My point is totally different from this argument.,1
"This is what GOP leaders are saying privately as well, reportedly.",1
Because he‚Äôs fat and unhealthy! Am I right? I get it! We should fat shame him!,1

I do agree with you that what Trump does still matters, as he is shooting himself in the face constantly, and he faces multiple lawsuits and investigations. That's all still news.",1
We can get over it when fewer than 71 million people decide to vote for him.,1
I'm not saying he doesn't have his own voter base. What I'm saying is every voter already knows whether they're going to vote for him or against him. All these stories about him and what he does doesn't change the number of people that are going to vote for him.,1
"As a foreigner looking in, I have to ask, how can you stomach voting for this embarrassing little gobshite? He is a joke.",1
How do you deal with your best friend bring a trump supporter.,1
"If he gets primaried next year, then they will stop talking about him.",1
"Yeah but DeSantis voters would vote Trump if Trump was the choice, and visa versa.",1
"Uhmmm so you‚Äôll never be over it? I get what you meant by the comment bud but take my advice, you‚Äôll be a lot happier when you stop worrying about what everyone else is doing and just focus on you and now. Don‚Äôt worry about some guy who is literally at the end of his life and is probably no where near ever being elected president again. Have a beer, take in the sun/ or rain. You got this!",1
"Biden and Trump are jokes, in my opinion. But I looked at the policies and I picked Trump. And I don‚Äôt regret it, if I‚Äôm honest. In 2016, I was worried about WW3, but with no ears and foreign affairs actually going surprisingly well with a big peace treaty in the Middle East and no new wars, I was delightfully surprised.

I‚Äôm anti-war, and I think Ukraine is a corrupt country, cutting off water to Crimea, and I don‚Äôt like Russia either. I don‚Äôt get a support for war on either side. Biden can‚Äôt clean our house at home. This chemical disaster in Ohio, for example, I think Trump handled it better than Biden or his team.

Call him names all you want to, but it doesn‚Äôt help anyone have a civil conversation.",1
We agreed to never talk about politics,1
"Trump voters wouldn't. That's the tiger the GOP is riding. 

That's why even now, the GOP officials are trying to get Trump to say publicly that should he not win the primary, he'll support the GOP candidate, and <shocker> he won't say that.

Trump will claim DeSantis (or whomever)  cheated, and would run 3rd party.

In 2016, Trump lost the Iowa Caucus to Ted Cruz of all people, and he said Ted Cruz cheated.",1
"Oh, believe me, I don't think there's a chance in hell that he could get elected, and I am hoping that he continues to destroy the GOP, so I'm not at all ""worrying"" about that. I'm just saying there are a lot of really fucking stupid people in this country to fall so hard for an obvious grifter, even after he sold them virtual trading cards and handed out campaign hats to people who had just suffered an unspeakable environmental tragedy in their backyard.",1
You're situation is more proof that he cannot gain a single vote regardless of what he does. This is my point.,1
Just taking a leaf from the Orange one‚Äôs book. I think gobshite sums him up perfectly. Every time he opens his mouth incoherent rambling lies and exaggerations spew forth. He is everything I abhor in a human.,1

"To sell books, that‚Äôs all. No one in their right would vote for her.",1
Yawn. She may actually get fewer votes than Kanye.,1
Is she gonna seek the Republican nomination too?,1
"I am not bothered by this. She was definitely the least qualified and craziest person on the stage last time, but even she managed some coherent and salient points. The person most seen as the most unqualified on the Democratic side is still better than Ted Cruz and leagues ahead of the MTG, Boebert ,Gosar caucus. She didn't go anywhere last time, and will do even less this time.",1
Orb mother,1
She wants a fox news job.  That's it.  That's why she's doing this.  She'll hit all the Republican talking points and try to poison the well.  Maybe she'll even announce Sinema as her running mate.,1

"I like Marianne, and I don‚Äôt think she deserves the ridicule she gets. That said, the democrats don‚Äôt need someone splitting the ticket if Biden decides to run again.",1
Sacrificial opposition so we feel good there is a primary.,1
"Fool me once, ok she didn't fool me last time.  I gave her half an hour of my attention and realized she was certifiable.   But still, Marianne, just stay home, it's not gonna happen for you.",1
She just a Trumpy MAGA Qanon Cult member and everyone knows it sitting with Gen Qanon and Putin tells you all you need to know about this attention seeking drama queen.  This weekend speaking at the Capitol for the RePUTINlicans along with Fox ‚ÄúNews‚Äù Tulsi .  Never gonna let that happen again.,1
I can‚Äôt believe they haven‚Äôt surfaced anyone to take the job.,1
Joe Biden would have to be insane not to step aside and let a younger person take the stage. I‚Äôm 100% voting for her.,1
"Good. Let's face it, the man has the mental acuity of a radish.",1
Don't blink.,1
She‚Äôs so annoying,1
For-Profit politics is an embarrassment too humanity.,1
I'm sure both of her supporters are excited.,1
lmao,1
I swear I despise this lady!,1
I'm going to check into her. I'm not voting for Biden again.,1
Again?  Are the three people who voted for her last time still interested?,1
Let‚Äôs go baby! I think she comes off as genuine. Which is better than most.,1
Omg this is a joke campaign‚Ä¶,1
Nothing in MSM. Sounds like The Hill trying to cause conflict on the left as they love to do.,1
Afrojack.,1
I feel like this is almost everyone's reaction when they read this.,1
"Nobody in their right minds would vote for Donald Trump or Ron DeSantis either, so there‚Äôs that.",1
"hey, second place isn't too bad...",1
"But they like MTG for some reason. 

Can we get like a psychologist and a sociologist to explain this phenomenon please?",1
"You're thinking tulsi, who's a good friend of putins. Maryanne is the crystals and strange energies woman.",1
"Actually she‚Äôs pretty far to the left, never a fox‚Äôer.   However this strikes me as an ego trip that will generate attention but go nowhere.",1
Why? He's doing a good job.,1
"I'm assuming you are joking, but the woman IS at 70, no millennial herself.",1
"Fair point with criticism towards The Hill in that regard. I'm a bit neutral with The Hill.

However for MSM, Fox News - as well as Yahoo, Business Insider and New York Post have all confirmed Marianne Williamson will be challenging Joe Biden. 

Also very recent Marianne's twitter feed heavily suggests she'll be challenging Joe Biden, announcement March 4th.",1
"But her spirit is young, she frequently renews it with crystal energy and pyramid power.  ü§°",1
"Any Democrat has a challenge since they have to win by a larger margin than Republicans and corporate media plays bothsideism softening the right-wing crazy train and playing up progressives as a similar extreme on the left. So, the election will always be razor thin no matter what, even if Trump wins the primary.",1
"Then start volunteering now. Turn your worry into action. DeSantis is an odd duck, so help define him early.",1
"Eh, the first step is realizing that it's not just DeSantis, but anybody who makes it out of the GOP Primary with the nomination will be like this. Likewise, for all the weaknesses Biden has, incumbency is one of the strongest political strengths out there. Focusing on the individual characters is what the opposition wants you to do, when in reality, it's vote Blue, no matter who.",1
"Desantis crumbles at any kind of debate. He falls apart when confronted by people so this makes him look extremely weak. Middle ground voters would not vote for someone willing to strip the rights away from them especially nationally. Some states would vote for him but I doubt enough states would to give him the presidency. We've seen him yell at kids and things like banning books. The ""woke war"" as he calls it is great for his state but nationally that will not work. Also restricting women's rights bit every Republican in the ass this midterm so it's definitely gonna come back harder in 2024 for the presidential race. If Republicans allow the US to default the entire nation (which is UNCONSTITUTIONAL btw) it will cause a huge revolt against Republicans as it will screw our economy for decades, hurt regular and rich citizens and cause inflation which they have been calling for being brought under control to skyrocket.",1
"If Trump doesn't get the nomination, it would be ideal if he ran as a 3rd party candidate and took along his wackos, dividing the party and making it easier for Biden to win.",1
"So many repubs are still trump supporters, don't know if they would vote for desantis. Of course they wouldn't vote for a dem either. Maybe they just won't vote?",1
But that is assuming trump bows out gracefully and doesn‚Äôt explode the party with his hissy fit when he loses.,1
It‚Äôs irrelevant because WHEN not if Trump runs as a third party he is going to split the Republican vote making it impossible for them to win the election.,1
"Best we can hope for is DeSantis wins the GOP Nom then we all help divide and conquer. Split them between Trump and DeSantis.  A few, but just enough, will NEVER leave Trump.  Let‚Äôs keep it that way.  Every chance we get we split DeSantis vs Trump.  Conservatives don‚Äôt turn on a dime.  They dig in.  2 camps of them and we win.",1
"Honestly, DeSantis is such a terrible communicator and public speaker that once he is on the nationsl stage he will not be generally accepted by the country like he is in Florida; the real risk is--yet again--another Trump v Biden ticket.",1
Kinda just depending on D.Sans and Big Orange to split the vote sufficiently with cat fighting so grandpa can win.,1
 They didn‚Äôt have the votes in 2020 they won‚Äôt have them in 2024.,1
"DeSantis has a record, not just bombast. That actually makes him easier to defeat.",1
"DeSantis will not be able to translate his Florida fascism and popularity outside of that state.
Biden will only get more popular as we see the benefits of sound leadership.",1
"As a Floridian, this is my nightmare.",1
"My hope is that if someone other than Trump wins the primary, Trump will run as an independent and split the vote.",1
"Dems need to find someone younger who will be more electable. I like Biden, but he already has a lot of baggage and he is no spring chicken.",1
Republicans consistently lose the popular vote in modern presidential elections. I don't see DeSantis' policies changing this in any way. It's just a matter of the Electoral College which I have no idea how to overcome,1
"I‚Äôve been kinda under the guise that even though Biden has an approval rating sub 13%, and Democrats want someone else to lead the party, Democrats will still vote Biden if it is him vs. the Republican nominee. We can not want an 80 year old man running as our nominee at the same time as voting the democratic nominee regardless of who it is. I think we can all agree that in the political scene right now, another Presidential win for Republicans is an end to democracy in the USA and the beginning of a true oligarchal dictatorship + fascism.",1
"Personally, I don't think DeSantis stands a chance with such a divided republican base. And I don't think Trump has enough support to beat Biden.",1
The best case scenario for dems in 24 is a desantis ticket because trump will run third party to punish republicans. He will siphon off millions of votes in a world where he lost by 7 million last time anyway. Republicans are fucked.,1
"Don't worry...If Trump is the nominee, Biden beats Trump **again**.  


If Trump is **not** the GOP nominee, his ego will require him to run third party, effectively kneecapping any other GOP nominee. It's the only good reason to be patient over the prosecutions that should put Trump in prison. Trump **not behind bars** leaves him free to f\*\*k up their sh\*t.  


Go Trump/Lake 2024 - The Suicide Vest Party",1
"If some gerrymandering had gone differently, we probably would still have the house. Namely, we lost seats in NY because their map was overturned and, in my home state of OH, we could have actually gained a couple seats had the Republicans in this state not gotten away with an illegal map. So while the midterms were disparaging, there was no red wave, and we narrowly lost the house because of the gerrymandering. 

While I understand your concern about DeSanctimonious, I don‚Äôt think he has national appeal. He is too extreme for the independent voters. Also, assuming he even enters the race, it‚Äôs going to be a long and bitter primary election because of Trump. They will be slinging mud at each other, and you can fully expect a divided Republican Party at the end of it all. Polls that place Biden and DeSanctimonious in a head to head show DeSanctimonious winning, but those polls are worthless when the campaign hasn‚Äôt even started, there have been no debates, and the polls haven‚Äôt been conducted in key battleground states.",1
"I don‚Äôt want to count my chickens before they hatch, but DeSantis is 0% charming and his biggest sell is owning the Libs. Florida is not the whole country and he‚Äôd have to come up with actual ideas to win.",1
WE THOUGHT TRUMP WAS A SURE THING UNTIL HE LOST. Put that same passion into the next election and FUCKING GET YOUR FRIENDS AND GEN Z TO VOTE!,1
"Nah, people see what a fascist as whole DeSantis is, Biden is doing a good job as president.",1
"Personally, I don't think Deathantis is going to run in 2024. I think he will wait till 2028...",1
"It's good to be concerned. However, there's no need to build the DeSantis myth. He's a whiny little schlub that won't attract people to his sideshow the way Trump does. Best we can hope is that Trump and DeStantis fight it out in Florida, leaving each other battered and their constituencies conflicted. There is a certain percentage of the Trump faithful that won't be converted to DeSantis. What that percentage is, we don't know yet.",1
"I'm sort of in the same camp. I remember how aged Bill Nelson didn't have enough fight in him in his race against Rick Scott and lost.

Personally, I think California Governor Gavin Newsome would be a better match against DeSantis. He's not afraid to go toe-to-toe with DeSantis and won't have any problem making DeSantis look like a fool!",1
"Keep in mind, the incumbent president always has an advantage over their challenger. DeSantis would be wise to let Trump lose again to Biden. I think a lot of folks--not just Democrats--are sick of Trump's election lies. Every time Trump claims the election was stolen he looks weak because he is clearly powerless to change anything. Nikky H. will split the field if DeSantis runs and she will end up being offered Vice President from Trump. I honestly think this is her true angle and it's fucking pathetic. She will knee-cap DeSantis; run for vice president; elevate her image for a 2028 run. But who knows ü§∑.....",1
"If Biden wants to prove he isn‚Äôt as insane as Trump or DeSantis, he won‚Äôt run a second time. He‚Äôs going to let a young person take the stage against these crazy a-holes.",1
"Not super worried about DeSantis as he is not a cult figure the way Trump was.  And Trump had a TV show that made him seem like he knew what he was doing (although that just turned out to be editing).  If Trump and DeSantis both run , they‚Äôll split the Republican vote and Trump is too much of an egomaniac to quit",1
Honestly I worry more about Trump. I don‚Äôt think Desantis would beat Trump in the primaries to be able to actually run against Biden. Trump people are crazy loyal to him and many people who voted for Biden over Trump are middle of the road people who a lot have been upset about the economy and inflation. I‚Äôve seen friends who I never thought in a million years would be supportive of Trump starting to show favoritism towards him.,1
"I think DeSantis will win as well. It‚Äôs horrible. He focuses on things that make no difference but make big headlines. Florida is bursting with homelessness, drugs, and poverty, but he is bullying librarians.  He‚Äôs revamping colleges, when his kids won‚Äôt go to a Florida college (Ivy League all the way). He is actual smart person like his lowlife brother, Ted Cruz, and spouts his bullshit for votes. There‚Äôs nothing real there except his quest for power.",1
I think you are right.,1
"I read an article today comparing DeSantis to Jesse Helms from the early 80s. Showing that like Helms, DeSantis is unlikely to get the nomination because of how extreme he is. Helms for instance, was also discriminatory against LGBTQ people, such as trying to get gay people barred from becoming school teachers. Obviously the label LGBTQ didn't exist yet but hatred for them was just as strong. 

The country as a whole is much more accepting than it was back in the 80s. If Helms couldn't get a foot hold, maybe there is hope that DeSantis won't be able to either.",1
"As a someone who lives in FL, when the rest of Murica meets DeathSantis and see how he really is I don‚Äôt think they will like him.",1
Speaking as a non party perspective im not sure desantis makes it out alive of the primary.,1
"I am hoping that Biden is not going to run. He did not intend to, and he will be tired and old. We should be looking for an Obama candidate. Someone qualified ofc, but ideally young and smart, and I'm willing to lean hard into ""young and smart"" for the right person.",1
"I‚Äôm hoping DeSantis and Trump will take each other down. I wish there were a stronger democratic candidate. Biden is not popular, even among many democrats and he is looking frail.",1
"DeSantis is burying himself with constricting Floridians‚Äô constitutional rights. He thinks he‚Äôs doing something noble but he‚Äôs breaking his constituents. I expect to see a mass exodus from Florida at the end of the school year and a severe drop in university registrations for next year. When the kids leave their money making, tax paying parents go with them. This will be a melt down of a cancellation for Florida. 

The state can‚Äôt survive being run by militia-minded, meth-head, trailer trash.",1
"It‚Äôs very worrying. Please learn about ways you can help get out the vote. www.vote411.org is a good website from the League of Women voters. Please share. If you would like help finding a meaningful volunteer opportunity, let me know and I‚Äôll help. If not, just keep talking up voting to your like minded friends and family.",1
"I love you, Joe. Please don't run again.",1
Let's see how he does in Republican primary. DeSantis comes off as a Jeb! To me.,1
"No you can‚Äôt borrow my weapons and rations when your president gets us in a combination civil / world war. It‚Äôs time to forget the divisive 2 party system. If you truly think one person in the American government has that much power, you are my enemy.",1
"De Santis is almost like an Adolf Hitler. He is a fascist and people also adore him and admire him. Yes, Biden would lose to De Santis. De Santis will be (unfortunately) our next President.",1
"You are right to be worried.

Biden beats trump again but he will indeed lose to desantis.

Let's hope trump is the nominee.",1
"""I'm really a Trump supporter trolling. Wanted to know liberals thoughts""",1
Hey at least DeSantes is not Tr*mp,1
Apparently your party already lost if the incumbent drops out.  So D are likely running Biden if he can,1
"For about a year now I‚Äôve been foreseeing a DeSantis 2024 win, unfortunately. I‚Äôm also in Florida. I hope to God that Trump or Cheney runs independent.",1
"I wouldn't worry about that.  The agism thing would certainly come to play, but fundamentally it all depends upon whether Trump would run as independent.  I don't know those odds, but they seem significantly high.",1
"I don't know if it'll even get to that point.

A lot of high ranking and well known democratics stay mum when asked if they will support a second term for Biden. No one will support a run for Harris.

Democrats need to work fast on getting a replacement and it seems they're courting Gavin Newsom, the Governor of California. I hate the guy. A lot of people don't like him here, but it's a ""vote blue no matter who"" situation that he's coasted on. You need more than that during a presidential run.

He's shmarmy, hypocritical, and has a car salesman feel to him. He vacillates based on public opinion--science, numbers and facts will always lose out here. He will tank in all traditional red states. He will flounder in blue states with a strong blue collar back bone. He may be too west coast for east coast liberals. However, some democrats are courting him for a potential run and it is a bad fucking idea. Newsom was already running ads against DeSantis during the summer of 2022, which confused a lot of Californians and, in the end, was made fun of for jumping the gun.

Biden won't make it to another election, I don't think the party will allow it, but I don't see anyone viable as of yet and election season is closing in fast.",1
Eye don‚Äôt think DeSanti‚Äôs will loose.,1
High chance.,1
"Is there a chance that Democrats would nominate someone else, not Biden?",1
"If the election were today desantis would win 320 to 350 EV, and maybe close in the popular. I agree with the other commenters who said get involved now. Sign up people to vote now. Argue with people on social media so their voice is not the only one heard, getting burner accounts if your family or work can't know. Spread real news and good left memes. Memes are easy to read and tell a story than even idiots can understand.",1
Trump will destroy Desantis in the primaries. He still runs the GOP,1
"Lose.  The word is LOSE.

Loose means less tight.",1
Would Biden even run in 2024? There are other Dem options...,1
Because needs to promote his successes much better.,1
My mom as a conservative doesn‚Äôt like desantis. Feels he‚Äôs too far right...,1
"If DeSantis went further right, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôd harm his popularity with today‚Äôs Republican Party at all, and that‚Äôs what scares me. If it comes down to being between him and Trump, I imagine it will only encourage both of them to see who is the most anti-everything and who can do the most to serve the interests of ultra-conservative and evangelical voters who want nothing more than to throw the country backwards a hundred years. 

So, in other words, I couldn‚Äôt agree more that people should absolutely be talking more about this possibility, because it‚Äôs becoming more and more apparent that that‚Äôs the exact direction the country is taking.",1
"Maybe my point is a litle unpopular, but the best chance for democrats in my opinion is to replace Biden and do a primary as well.",1
Bc trump will negotiate a pardon in exchange for dropping out.,1
Facts,1
Left wing extreme and right wing extreme are both crazy though,1
What do you mean democrats have to win by a larger margin?  In the presidential election it's the rules of the electoral college.,1
And be the Stacy Abrams of your own community!,1
"So, what are the most impactful things to do as a volunteer? A friend of mine suggested in the last race to ‚Äúhelp do outreach phone calls‚Äù but I personally hate the amount of outreach that reaches me. 

What are other things that need done, in your opinion?",1
üíØ,1
As the control freak he is..,1
"I agree, but I think Biden's the favorite. DeSantis has a nasally voice and says he's 5'7"". 

That will cost him a fraction of Trump's machomen and he needs 100%, if not more due to Boomers dying.",1
üíôüíôüíô,1
I definitely plan on voting Democratic no matter who the nominee is.,1
The GOP increasingly refuses to host or participate in debates because of how their rhetoric comes across.,1
"About DeSantis being a terrible communicator, I've read this from several other people below. To be honest I haven't listened to him giving speeches of holding campaign events that much.

I think the powers-that-be at Fox are hyping him up because they think is more likely to win than Trump. But tt seems he is most well known for his high-profile fight with Disney, and flying immigrants to Martha's vineyard, rather than anything he has said.

It's completely possible that  I am worrying too much, or underestimating Biden (I've underestimated him before).",1
"I've seen some people suggest that Trump is aware of that possibility and is using it as leverage to get the nomination; he'd basically be saying ""pick me or I'll make sure our team loses"" to the GOP",1
"If that happens, they will do what daddy tells them to do, knowing what a revengeful bitch he is, he will make Rons life miserable. He possibly goes third party because he is delusional about his overall popularity.",1
"As much as this could be the likely scenario, I will not count on this happening. Republicans are smart enough to not tear each other apart in November.",1
"Also, let‚Äôs be honest. DeSantis is horrible and fascist, but I think he would be less destructive than Trump. I‚Äôm voting in the GOP primary for the most sane candidate possible but I may even vote for DeSantis (ü§Æ) because 4 more years of Trump would be a catastrophe.

But you know what would be worse? Trump losing another general election. They would riot.",1
"This. For Republicans, DeSantis is great on paper, but as soon as he starts talking, he exudes a lot of Jeb Bush ‚Äúplease clap‚Äù energy. 

There‚Äôs zero chance Trump supporters will get excited about him (or at least, not nearly as excited as they are about Trump). 

I predict Trump will win the nomination again, because he has the Republican Party by the balls. He‚Äôs holding them hostage and will burn everything and everyone to the ground if he doesn‚Äôt get the nomination.",1
Did you ever actually listen to trump speak?  Republicans don‚Äôt care how terrible and moronic a candidate is. If Fox News says to vote for him. That‚Äôs all that matters.,1
"The question isn't whether Republicans vote but whether Democrats come out and vote, the latter can be harder to persuade to show up at the polls.",1
never underestimate the Christian nationalists. they won overturning roe v wade with 70% of all Americans disagreeing,1
"as an American, the mere fact that he can win is a nightmare. at least trumps little insurrection was unplanned and ill conceived.  De Santis is actually intelligent enough to make it happen",1
Yes!!!,1
There needs to be an age limit. He's going to die in office if he wins another term.,1
"I agree. I will totally vote for Biden if he is the nominee, and I think most other Democrats will as well. My main concern is the tiny sliver of voters in swing states that can decide the outcome of the election.",1
"Trump would lose to Biden again. 

not sure we need Biden term 2, but he's exceeded my expectations for him. 

we need a younger more charismatic leader in 2024/ 28 to keep the WH.",1
"I also really like Newsom. He knows how to put up a fight, and to inspire people. I could see him running for President in 2028.",1
"Not that I‚Äôm necessarily disagreeing, but who do you think should run, in that case?",1
"Thanks. Volunteering in politics has been something I've wanted to do for a while now. Although I'm not exactly the best at communicating with strangers, so I don't know how effective I would be doing things like canvassing.",1
"I didn't get that impression from OP's post. They even mention the good job Biden has done, and that Biden isn't getting enough credit.

And I agree. Biden wasn't my first pick, but he has done a good job steering us out of a crisis. And unlike his orange predecessor he is quiet about it, just getting the work done without boasting about it every few seconds. It has been refreshing.",1
"I swear to god I'm not a Trump supporter trolling. I'd be just fine with Biden winning a second term. I'm just worried that he isn't the best person to defeat a Republican. I could be wrong.

EDIT: I don't blame you for being suspicious btw. The amount of anti-Biden concern trolling is high",1
"He‚Äôs worse.

Edit: In case anybody is wondering how DeSantis could possibly get elected look no farther than right here. There are a lot of Democrats that sit out elections because they don‚Äôt feel like voting is important and that the Republican candidate isn‚Äôt a threat to a normal way of life.",1
But the size of them and the outcomes from them are currently not equal,1
Do show us an example of left wing extreme in the U.S.,1
"Right, and because Democrats are concentrated in cities they can't afford to drop a single vote in rural areas or they'll lose. Meanwhile Republicans numbers can drop in rural areas and they still win. So, overall when Democrats are polling evenly with Republicans they will lose. Technically I guess it's polling margins I'm referring to.",1
Gerrymandering by the GOP,1
And the rules of the electoral college are what makes Democrats have to win by a larger margin.,1
"You need to make peace with the fact that we do have to contact people to remind them to vote. Believe it or not, most people aren‚Äôt signed up on campaign emails, etc. so the contact they get is minimal. 

You can sign up as a precinct chair in your county and volunteer to knock on doors, register voters, and yes, phone bank. Knocking on doors is one of the most effective ways to garner votes.

But if that makes you uncomfortable, there are several postcard and letter writing programs (Postcards to Swing States is one) and your county will likely have a series of text banks.

You can also volunteer in a more background way by organizing events, etc. Call your local Democratic Party and find out when they meet.

Be prepared to show up for a few meetings before anything starts to happen.",1
"Consider writing postcards! There are more of us than them, some people just need reminding/a gentle push.",1
"I have seen a few of his speeches and he just melts when confronted. He also yelled at children who were wearing masks near him and kinda bullied them into take them off during a press conference. Along with still hiding Covid death numbers, targeting a whistleblower who let the world know that he was hiding Covid numbers and under reporting by having her house raided and her computers seized along with many other things. 

So there's just a lot of ammo that can be used against him and his ""achievements"" are also turn offs for most of the middle ground undecided voters he would have to win over to have a chance. It's not impossible just very unlikely for Desatan to win even the primary as he has to go up against people who probably will have a cleaner look then him with all the things he is currently doing that are viewed by some as fascist.",1
Good point! There's nothing he loves more than having leverage over people!,1
"I never thought of it that way until now, but that is absolutely something that he seems like he'd be willing to do.",1
That's what I'm hoping for. Trump going third party will split the conservative vote and hand the Democrats an easy win.,1
Trump wants to be president again and he doesn‚Äôt care what anyone else wants and he still has enough loyal dumbasses that would vote for him that it will take electoral votes from the Republican states and make it easier for the Democrats to win.,1
"Don't discount Trump's vindictiveness. He isn't a Republican, he was just using them for his own benefit, and they were doing the same. If he doesn't get the nomination, they'll have to bribe him bigly to keep him out of the race as a 3rd party candidate. 

On the other hand, it's questionable if he can recruit anyone competent enough to file the papers properly.",1
Except they aren‚Äôt.,1
"no, no, no. DeSantis is far more dangerous than Trump. unlike Trump been in politics, knows the game. and is far more intelligent, meaning HIS INSURRECTION would likely succeed",1
It‚Äôs like picking between a snake and scorpion.  Neither is a good option.  As long as neither idiot sits in the WH I‚Äôm ok.,1
"DeSantis is literally building an army in Florida. He's waaaay more dangerous than trump.  
  
He's young, and competent.",1
DeSantis would be much more destructive.,1
"Florida resident here, there are a ton of DeSantis and Disney-ized DeSantisland stickers on cars. A lot. Conservatives here love him.",1
"Trump was a reality TV star, and as sad as it is to say this, he has a kind of cheap game show charisma that helped propel his political career. DeSantis on the other hand is about as charismatic as a 2 pack of saltines.",1
"A bigger thing to wait on is to see if Trump runs as an independent. Despite him losing some followers he would absolutely demolish any chance the Republicans would have to swing those states I think because he would split the vote of the republican base. Whether the politicians want that or not, it‚Äôs what they‚Äôre gonna get when they made Trump an outlet for racists and bigots to throw their votes to without question",1
"There are letter writing campaigns https://www.mobilize.us/mobilize/event/413655/ and postcard writing campaigns https://postcardstovoters.org/ , texting opportunities, voter ID assistance https://www.voteriders.org/.  Also contact your local Democratic or progressive party and get on their mailing lists. LMK if I can help further.",1
"Yes, he is much worse.  All these policies and laws in FL that DeSantis has pulled off is nothing that Trump could have done.  He‚Äôs insanely popular here in FL. Not sure how it‚Äôs playing nationwide.",1
"Love it, you don‚Äôt think it exists.",1
"This is a big issue in Los Angeles County, which is primarily Democrat. It's so ugly as they Gerrymander across **racial lines**. The issue most recently came up in Los Angeles during the last city council scandle late last year. 

That shit needs to stop **everywhere**, all around.",1
"Gerrymandering is a huge problem but it does not impact presidential elections.

Civics lesson time!  Electoral college is the paradigm used for presidential elections.",1
"This statement is misleading. In the electoral college system whichever party gets the greatest number of electoral college votes is the winner.

Democrats do not have to win by a greater margin of electoral college votes, all they need is one more electoral college vote than the republicans",1
Knocking on doors is def the best way,1
I agreed with you on that. I just won't bet on them doing it. Republicans are 100% all in on trying to get all three branches or keeping enough power to obstruct.,1
Republican voters will fall in line and will vote against their own interests because they're scared of anything that's not Aryan. Throw in independent voters and I discount nothing.,1
"Well, fuck. Why can‚Äôt he just be normal?",1
Can you provide an example?,1
"Human psychology time! Gerrymandering has the effect of dampening turnout because people hear 'its gerrymandered' and they don't stop and think: ""well this only affects House races, I'll still go an cast my vote for all the other races"". No, they hear its gerrymandered and think ""my vote doesn't count, I won't bother going""",1
"Reality Time, Hillary Clinton had three million more votes than Trump.",1
"You're absolutely right. Gerrymandering impacts representation in the House, but it has no bearing on Presidential elections.",1
"Who ever has 270 electoral votes is who wins. Since there are 538 total votes, 270 is the least amount you can have and be in the majority. Unless a state (or DC) gets disqualified for some reason then the total number of votes are recalculated.",1
Are you talking the Republican Party or the voters?  Because the voters that support him are so blinded by Trump and the way he is that they won‚Äôt care if it sabotages the rest of the party especially if he tells his voters that all the people against him are RINOS,1
"95-98 percent of voters falling line is enough. 2% voting third party can sway the election. Elections in this country are won on the margins. Even if Trump runs again, Cheney will tun third party to fuck him. She gets 2-3 million votes and thats the whole ball game. I‚Äôm not too worried.",1
"dunno, but sadly he is gen X too. though I deny he belongs in Gen X. definitely acts more like a boomer",1
https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2122593119,1
"You are completely correct about gerrmandering's negative effects! 

The original comment that I was replying to stated that democrats have to win presidential elections ""by a larger margin"" which I still maintain is misleading.

op clarified that they meant polls not actual votes, but that seems to be getting lost here.",1
I'm thinking 80/20 party more than voters. They've made it clear that they want power.,1
"The only person running third party would be Trump or maybe DeSantis. Everyone else in that party has no spine to run a third party at the expense of their political career. Cheney could, but she'll have been out of politics for too long.",1
">Ideology.

>Our primary predictor was a mutually exclusive categorical variable and included individuals who were identified as committed to Islamist, right-wing, or left-wing causes. Examples of groups supporting Islamist ideology included al-Qaeda and Hezbollah; examples of groups supporting right-wing ideology included the Ku Klux Klan and the National Alliance; and examples of groups supporting left-wing ideology included the Animal Liberation Front and the Weather Underground. Right-wing supporters represented 59%, left-wing 23%, and Islamist 18% of the sample. We created two dummy-coded variables with far-right ideology as the reference category.

Yep, the [Animal Liberation Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Liberation_Front) and the [Weather Underground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_Underground) are definitely big players in US liberal politics (I say this as a 'radical' environmentalist.)


>The findings from two studies, characterized by very different scopes and units of analysis, provide substantial support for conclusions about the relationship between ideology and the use of politically motivated violence. **First, data on extremists in the United States showed that left-wing radicals were less likely to use violence than right-wing and Islamist radicals**. Second, using worldwide data we found that in comparison to right-wing and Islamist groups, attacks motivated by left-wing groups were less deadly. These substantive conclusions were not affected by the inclusion of a set of control variables. Thus, the main findings appear to be robust across levels of analysis (i.e., individuals, groups) and geographical scope of the data.

>**Our results are in line with past research showing that conservative ideology‚Äîrepresented in our datasets by both right-wing and Islamist causes‚Äîis positively related to violent political behavior. These results support the view that left-wing and right-wing extremists are not equivalent when it comes to the use of violence** (48; see also [49] for related findings on the victims of hate crimes in the United States). Whereas our findings are not inconsistent with the idea that individuals espousing different ideologies may feel equally negative toward worldview-threatening others (50), they suggest that the social consequences of extreme right-wing hostility may be more harmful than those caused by the far left (see [50] for a similar point).",1

That's not favoritism or discrimination. That's called equality. What Republicans are trying to do is reverse equal rights to counter change that has resulted in minorities and other affected communities having equal rights and a voice. That's not favoritism.

It's not that you're ranking too red It's just that you're making definitive statements that are untrue. Like calling Michigan blue in this comment.  Michigan went blue in only 7 of the last 12 elections and voted the same as Wisconsin in the last 8 elections. So to call one red and one blue doesn't make any sense.,1

"They've been in a historic drought for over a decade, and we aren't seeing any innovation.

"The real problem is that gasoline is a legacy aviation fuel, and the average age of the GA fleet is almost 40 years. 

100LL is already more expensive than Jet-A; switching to 100UL will increase operating costs even more. The best, long-term solution is to adopt diesel-cycle piston engines that allow piston-powered GA fleet to operate on Jet-A. Such engines have been available since 2007, and are rapidly gaining in popularity. As a spark-ignition gasoline aircraft is retired, it is just as likely to be be replaced with a compression-ignition diesel aircraft as another a gasoline aircraft. 

The market for AVGAS has likely peaked, which is good news and bad news for lead issues.  The good news is that there will be fewer and fewer aircraft needing lead. The bad news is that potential producers of unleaded fuel will be entering a rapidly declining market, so have little incentive to try.",1

So, I am in no way trying to defend DeSantis or let him off the hook by saying this, but calling someone with Italian ancestry a meatball has (perhaps unintentional) racist overtones.

"Prepare for R'wingnut attempts to trash Carter and make his administration seem horrible.

However, high inflation and high unemployment were here during Nixon - Remember his attempt at 'Wage and Price Controls'? or Ford's ""WIN"" buttons? The poorly financed Vietnam War and the OPEC embargoes were the main drivers. The stagflation and 'malaise' under Carter set the stage for Reagan's BAD POLICY of borrowing in the name of all and cutting taxes appreciably for a lucky few AKA 'trickle down' - a fancy name for stealing from all to give to a few. The nation's tax policy has been stuck in that groove for 43 years. It's up to us to end it by only voting in politicians who are willing to end it.

Before Reagan, this raid on the Treasury would have been UNTHINKABLE and was the first step in the immiseration of the middle class. $30 trillion borrowed over 43 years is the same as borrowing $50 per week from EVERY AMERICAN alive for or born since the Reagan Inauguration...approx 11.6 billion person years. $112,000 from each American alive for the entire 43 years.

I think that the historical consensus is that it was not initially written as a means to protect individual use of firearms but rather the existence of a ‚Äúwell-regulated militia‚Äù composed of citizens that made a standing army unnecessary. This was because of the initial paranoia of tyranny that followed the Revolutionary War.

Unfortunately, subsequent judicial review does declare that most restrictions on individual gun ownership is unconstitutional, especially in relatively recent court cases such as NYSRPA v. Bruen, even though this is probably historically misinformed. Not that treating the Constitution as some sort of dogma is historically accurate or an intelligent thing to do in itself.",1

"The 2A is an anachronism, just like our Electoral College. Possibly useful at the time it was written, out of date for today's world. If the nation were not bound by divided politics both of these features would be amended. 

Remember that our Constitution was written in the 18th century by a group of men who established the first republic to break away from a European monarchy with 'liberty for all' while maintaining chattel slavery for some. Masters often need arms to maintain control over the enslaved.  
At the time, the nation was largely a frontier, the possibility of a 'new' community needing to respond to an attack by the aboriginals who weren't all that happy with the encroachment. Also, in the run-up to the American Revolution, the crown had outlawed or confiscated the firearms of many of the citizens. Establishing an amendment that would ensure this would NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN was important for the Founders. Thirdly, the U.S. was established with legal chattel slavery. Owners of the enslaved needed access to their arms to be able to respond to instances of insurrection by their property. Lastly, settlers of new frontier needed firearms to hunt and protect their persons and property when an established authority will not be able to respond.   
Today, the U.S. has no frontier...that ended in the 1890s...and police and National Guard handle pretty much all cases of riot. Chattel slavery ended 158 years ago. What's left? Personal protection and protection from a tyranny. Small arms are never going to defeat a tyrannical government that has access to drones, aircraft, tanks, etc. but some Americans like to believe they will. The only liberty personal ownership of a firearm actual enables is political assassination, imo.

So what's left? Personal protection. The only way that outlawing all personal firearms would ever work is if no one else had a firearm but since guns outnumber citizens....400 million guns for 335 million people!...That's not gonna happen anytime soon. 

The 30K+ 'lives lost to gunshot' is not worth it, imo. An amendment adopted in a time when three aimed shots per minute was a goal that most could not reach doesn't work when battlefield designed weapons can fire 30 aimed shots in under a minute. It enables too much slaughter.  
Changing an amendment is a very heavy lift - has to pass both chambers of Congress and then majority votes in 38 states! I believe that we could require liability insurance on any weapon taken out of the home and then let the insurance industry ratchet down the mayhem.",1

"The second amendment was established to give a general public weapons to use against a tyrannical government. The founding fathers wanted its people to be armed so that they could defend themselves from their own government and from any foreign government that invades.

The US has not fought on its own soil in sometime and modern firearms (not referring to automatic weapons because  those are heavily monitored in the us) can unload a lot of bullets very fast. Something that the founders of america did not live with.

 The use of firearms by criminals Is routine in America. It is very easy to obtain a firearm in some states, and very hard in others. There are two arguments. 1) restrict guns through intense background checks and waiting periods to ensure only the best Americans have them. Effective at keeping guns out of the hands of criminals. 2) make it generally east for any non felon with stable health to own a gun.  Effective at stopping someone with a gun, but puts more guns in the general population.

Taking the second amendment away would make 1/2 the country go bananas. It would be difficult if not impossible to collect all the guns in America. Does the 2nd amendment make sense? Idk probably not, but it's with America forever.

"The 2nd Amendment is blowback from the founder's fear of a standing army, which they feared would inevitably be used to repress the citizenry.

Each state had a number of volunteer militia companies that would get together occasionally for a little refresher drill, and the hope was that this structure could be the basis of a volunteer army, called up in times of emergency. The fact that The state militia system had (mostly) failed miserably in the Revolution seems not to have made much impression on the founders.",1
Many people have a fetish for gun ownership which the modern interpretation of the 2nd Amendment supports. No amount of logic is going to appeal to gun addicts.,1

"I used to be a 2nd amendment liberal. I grew up with guns and both of my grandfathers were avid hunters.

I vividly remember a ‚Äòswitch‚Äô turning off in my head, complete disgust for what he did and the rifles he used. 
I use the analogy that when I was a kid (kindergarten) I LOVED wearing cowboy boots. Unfortunately another child at my school also wore cowboy boots and kicked another student in the head with his pointed boot and he had to be rushed to the hospital to get stitches. After that day, pointed boots/cowboy boots were banned. I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong but because of the action of another individual I could no longer wear my favorite boots to school. Why can‚Äôt we do this shit with guns? I understand that 95% of gun owners may be lawful or whatever but all it takes is one psycho to ruin it for everyone. Fuck guns and the horse they rode in on. 
BTW, when my grandparents passed away the family split up the large gun collection. I had inherited around 16 rifles/pistols. I kept two, a 1906 German Mauser and my grandfathers 1911 service pistol from his time in the Korean War. The rest I gave to other family members or sold.",1

Also at the time, the weapon of choice was a musket, a single-shot weapon that took, what, a minute to reload. The idea of a gun that would fire hundreds of bullets in a minute was far in the future.

You do need to protect that pre-existing natural individual right (per Cruikshank) if you want people to be able to show up with their arms in a militia. There is no historical consensus on this restrictive reading though. The idea that the right is somehow tied to militia membership didn't even exist in the federal courts until 1942, and the ""collective right"" wasn't formulated in such terms until 1976.

">first republic to break away from a European monarchy with 'liberty for all' while maintaining chattel slavery for some.

Yeah but that doesn't make the United States or the revolutionary war any less revolutionary; slavery was the reality of the entire world and the United States was way ahead when it came to abolition, at least in the north (Pennsylvania was the first ""democracy"" in the world to abolish slavery in 1780).


>Thirdly, the U.S. was established with legal chattel slavery. Owners of the enslaved needed access to their arms to be able to respond to instances of insurrection by their property.

I don't think this has any historical basis, since guns could also be acquired by the slaves and slave rebellions are something that would require the government to act, not individual people.

If bullets weren't invented until 1847, what were they shooting previously, spit wads? The founders were educated men who knew of the transformation of guns. For example, the Ferguson rifle. It was designed in 1770 and used by the British in 1777. This is a breech loading rifle that could fire 4 times per minute as opposed to the Brown Bess musket. They knew products would evolve in the future they just didn't know how. So, your argument is flawed.",1
"Cannons were privately owned during the revolutionary war. From my brief search out of curiosity, All the way up to 1812 there are records of private cannon ownership.

It isn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs simply a matter of discussing who gets the right to have the means of defending themselves.

Also, in reference to ‚Äúbullets were created after the constitution was written.‚Äù  Argument. That‚Äôs a slippery slope - I would contend that none of the founding fathers presumed there would be no further tech development in any realm that the constitution addresses. They were all relatively intelligent, highly educated business owners and (some) inventors, especially for their time period. I doubt they thought tech had peaked for humanity in 1776. 

Gun Fudds will argue that if the second amendment applies only to muzzle loading muskets then freedom of speech/press only applies to a printing press and quill and ink. This is just the vicious cycle people often trap their debates in. It‚Äôs pointless and aggravating. Even the idea that founding fathers only meant freedom of assembly for meeting in the time squares/taverns/churches is probably the one constitutionally protected actions the founding fathers would be most surprised about how things have developed- proof of that is this discussion right here, we are assembled on a subreddit discussing politics over electric mediums -likely hundreds of miles away from each other.  ü§Ø

When it was written, 2A stopped the federal government from making laws that kept state militia members from having guns. That way the states could form militias and the federal goverment wouldnt have the only army.",1

I understand your point but why use blatantly false information it just makes you seem so disingenuous and a liar..an ar-15 shoots 400 rpm which is the rifle people are concerned with why are you inflating it to 1000?

To do this they run 24/7 right-wing news that the liberal strawman will use big government to take away your guns,  turn your kids gay and give all your hard earned money to minorities, immigrants and lazy people who didn't earn enough and need to live off of government hand outs (social security, etc...).

 --- which is wild considering a third of Florida's budget comes from federal money, while DeSantis touts a surplus and uses it to ship migrants around the country, and the top 10 states most dependent on federal government money are red states.

But wokeness, CRT, antifa and the debt are your greatest threats, not Putin or that hoax global warming or COVID or lack of investments in infrastructure to compete globally.  

And people like Trump and DeSantis and Republicans in general are essentially having a competition on who better to save you from this strawman liberal.  

The Republican goal is to implement an illiberal (or fake) democracy run by the elite conservatives that include the Koch's, the Murdoch's and others following the playbook of Viktor Orban that keeps them in power permanently.

"this is not an honest question, it does not come from a place of inquiry, rather it is a general and quite assuming and leading. All Liberals don't claim that, all don't support it, in fact they may not even have a position about the current economic system.

Honest small reforms that move the needle are good.  Obamacare was obviously flawed, and a single-payer system would be more beneficial, but you cannot deny that people are better off today because of that law.  Keep working, keep pushing, but don‚Äôt throw away progress just because it doesn‚Äôt solve all problems in one swoop.  

Think of it like football, if you have a chance at a field goal, take it.  Is it as good as a touchdown, no.  But three points is three points.  Take the points, get your defense on the field, and try to get the ball back.  That‚Äôs how you win games.",1

So we should forget about social issues that because we‚Äôre not vocal enough about wealth disparity? How exactly would that help? And the democrats are trying to raise the minimum wage and make the rich pay taxes.,1
Most change happens rapidly.  Not incremental.  Obamacare was a way to prolong a failed private sector and really does not do much to fix it.  Just keeps it on life support,1

Well seems to bleed into social issues don't you think?,1
If the economic system is designed to reward the exploitation of those in need how many social issues can you really fix?  At best you can change who will be exploited but all your social causes will always be superficial.  Kind of like how we could end chatel slavery but just replaced it with prison slavery.  We still have slavery just a different face.,1

But the economic system rewards exploitation.  It would be like arguing not to switch from feudalism and just alliavate its inherit flaws with policy.,1

"""Convincing"" you to switch sides isn't really how it works. Being on the left is about having morals regardless of any religious views. They can be separate, you don't need one to get the other. But, here are some of my views:

Learn that anything that goes against a narrow mindset is not something that should be instantly demonized.

Learn and teach history as it happened and not through rose-colored glasses. Don't be afraid to learn that your ancestors might have done bad things.

The job of a politician is not to obstruct the opposing party to the detriment of your constituents.

EDIT: Just found one instance that might convince someone. The Wyoming State Legislature has a bill going through that puts a minimum age of 16 on child marriage. Right now a child can get married at any age in Wyoming. The State GOP is outraged over the possibility of limiting religious liberty. While only 3% of child marriages involve a child younger than 16. If that isn't a common sense reason to switch sides, I don't know what is.",1
"What an interesting question.  Honestly I never thought about a person trying to figure out how to be liberal.  I don't think there is a class.  Being liberal is so deeply rooted in beliefs that we are all better when we work together for the good of all.  This country was on this path then greed took over. 

 This liberal believes education should teach critical thinking, another words teach kids how to solve problems not teach them what to think.  They are the future and the problems they face we will not have a clue how to solve.  Religion will not fix the future, hating others because they do not look like you or think like you will not fix the future.  Guns and war will not fix the future.

This liberal believes we have to come together to save the planet.  Love is the answer as corny as that may sound.  Love our fellow humans, animals and the environment.",1
"For example in an ideal world, do you see everyone competing against each other, or working together?

For example one quote I heard that I like was someone asking the Chinese leader what keeps him awake at night, he said having to create 1 million new jobs every month.

Keep in mind world population over last 100 years has gone from 1.9 billion to 7.9 billion and the earth will continue for more than next 10000 years. Do you think it‚Äôs the best plan for everyone to be competing or working together? Do you think we will have a global employment rate of 95%+ forever competing? 
Add on to that robots are advancing so the need for humans doing jobs should go down and automation should go way up.

Can they plead the fifth this time? If so this is all pointless. No one is going to answer the important questions if they don't have to. The right thing to do is make sure Trump and his minions are held accountable but power and politics are more important to these clowns. Pence did the right thing ONCE!!,1
This is what like the 5000 person who‚Äôs been subpoenaed while investigating Trump?,1
"u/Any-Variation4081

You mentioned:

>>*Can they plead the fifth this time? If so  is all pointless. No one is going to answer the important questions if they don't have to. The right thing to do is make sure Trump and his minions are held accountable but power and politics are more important to these clowns. Pence did the right thing ONCE!!*

If you are given immunity? You can't plead the 5th.

There are two types of immunity: (1) transactional immunity (total immunity) and (2) use and derivative use immunity.

‚ñ† Transactional Immunity

>*Also known as total immunity, transactional immunity provides a shield against any future charges based on any matter related to the testimony. (The prosecution still can bring charges against the witness for matters that are unrelated to the testimony.) The federal criminal justice system does not offer transactional immunity, but many states do.*

‚ñ† Use and Derivative Use Immunity

>*This comes with more restrictions and thus is more often offered by prosecutors. Use and derivative use immunity protects the witness from having the prosecution use their statements or any evidence discovered from their statements against them. Essentially, this produces the same result as if the witness invoked their Fifth Amendment privilege and did not testify at all. It allows the prosecution to bring charges based on the same crime against the witness, as long as the charges are based entirely on independent evidence from a different source. Whether that evidence is sufficient to convict the witness without using their statements can be left to a judge or jury to decide.*

If you accept immunity and refuse to testify? Or try to plead protection under the Fifth Amendment?

 You could be held in contempt of court.

>*An individual who refuses to testify after being awarded immunity can be held in contempt of court and possibly jailed.*

And? Like you said? VP Pence did the right thing once.

Would he do it again?

Maybe if he was given immunity? 

He doesn't seem to want to say anything against disgraced one term twice impeached former President Trump.

For some unknown reason.

__Receiving Immunity for Testimony in a Criminal Case__ [here](https://www.justia.com/criminal/immunity-for-testimony).",1
I've been seeing this same headline with slight variations and different people for eight damn years now...,1
"Thank goodness former VP Pence has been subpoenaed.

Otherwise? I don't think __he would have made an appearance.__  

>*Former Vice President Mike Pence has been subpoenaed by the special counsel investigating Donald Trump and his role in January 6, 2021*

The memoir VP Pence wrote will be a problem for disgraced one term twice impeached former President Trump and his enablers, minions, sycophants, and lackeys.

>*Depending on his responses, prosecutors have the option to ask a judge to compel him to answer additional questions and override Trump's executive privilege claims.*

It's been __more than two years.__ 

Everybody's knowledge is like swiss cheese - there are holes in it. The longer we wait to hear the memories and testimony from key witnesses? 

More time will pass, and people might start to forget - conveniently.

>*The subpoena marks an important milestone in the Justice Department's two-year criminal investigation, now led by the special counsel, into the efforts by Trump and allies to impede the transfer of power after he lost the 2020 election. Pence is an important witness who has detailed in a memoir some of his interactions with Trump in the weeks after the election, a move that likely opens the door for the Justice Department to override at least some of Trump's claims of executive privilege.*

IMO? The memoir makes it easy to open the door on specific incidents related to the times before, during, and after 6 January.

I wonder if VP Pence wrote the nook with full knowledge that his written words could be an important part of the 6 January investigations?

Likely so.

>*In November, Pence published his memoir that detailed some of his interactions with Trump as the former president sought to overturn the results of his election loss to President Joe Biden. Pence and his team knew that the book's publication would raise the prospect that the Justice Department would likely seek information about those interactions as part of its criminal investigation, people briefed on the matter told CNN.*

Other members of disgraced one term twice impeached former President Trump‚Äôs inner circle are being compelled to testify.

>*Pence rebuffed an interview request from the House select committee that investigated the January 6 insurrection, but allowed top aides to provide testimony in the House's probe, as well as in the Justice Department's criminal investigation. The DOJ successfully secured answers from top Pence advisers Greg Jacob and Marc Short in significant court victories that could make it more likely the criminal investigation reaches further into Trump's inner circle.*

The Republican Party *currently supports* autocracy, bribes, bullying, cheating, control of a woman's body, dismantling the US Constitution, fascism, fear, fraud, hatred, insurrectionists, racism, stealing top secret government documents, white supremacy, __pursuit of alternative facts (lies)__ and grifting.

I've been thinking about this since 6 January:

‚ñ† Someone who openly appeals to the worst of us to ""ditch the US Constitution"", should be instantly __barred from holding any political office in perpetuity.__

‚ñ† When our officials take the oath of office, they have to promise to protect the US Constitution. If they want to destroy the US Constitution? How can they take the oath of office?

But because the American culture supports Petty shitty behavior, the bullies attacking liberals were not shut down like they should have been.

But of course the social justice Warriors had righteous conviction on their side. Like, if you see somebody committing a crime and you know it's wrong, just because somebody calls you a mean name doesn't mean you're going to stop standing up for a victim. So, both sides in this conflict kept up their perspective. The social justice Warriors kept trying to be activists and their critics continued to try and Bully them.

So, people who weren't really social justice Warriors and weren't really bullies either, felt the need to join in one way or the other.

"Yeah I don't really support the police but I can't exactly express that to a cop. That would be idiotic and it would be asking for trouble. Whenever I'm friendly to them they usually let me go. But maybe it's because I'm white. Like for instance one time I got pulled over for having a headlight out and I was completely drunk. (This was like 20 years ago). And the cop just let me go because I was friendly with him. And one time I swerved because I was texting and the cop just let me go because I was friendly. One time a cop caught me with weed and he just let me go because I was friendly with him.

But I'm white and these were all white cops. So maybe that has something to do with it.

But yeah if you're ever going to get in a fight with somebody you should expect to win. Otherwise why the hell are you asking to lose a fight? So I don't really understand why people are always trying to fight the cops. If you're going to fight the cops you have to be certain that you can kick his ass.",1

"It is not always a bad thing to have diversity/inclusive quotas for education and employment.

For example, in education, when students are only ever in classes with people like themselves, they tend not to become familiar with people in other groups. This can lead to racism and bigotry. As well as just a general lack of respect for other subcultures. People from other groups also sometimes bring different opinions which help to create a better environments to foster critical thinking.

Same with employment. Employers can often benefit from having a diversity of ideas, which can often come from a diversity of people.

That being said, affirmative action type policies tend to create hostility and resentment. Because lack of socioeconomic opportunity is often the cause as to why some groups are underrepresented, we could shift to affirmative action based on socioeconomic status. And so more politically savvy, and it would also be inclusive of people who needed more opportunity who are in majority groups.",1

I think mostly the high military spending talking point is used to argue against conservative ideology.

It makes a lot of sense.   The fourth amendment makes it clear that you have the right to privacy.   So what you medically share with your doctor is a choice you make not the government.,1
"One has a right to privacy in ones home too, but that doesn't mean if one does anything in the home it is protected. Gov can get a subpoena for instance and raid a home. No reason to think abortion is any different. One has right of privacy with doctor, but if something is done illegally gov can request info and prosecute. Not sure why you think right to privacy somehow means abortion rights. This is especially true if at a point in time of pregnancy one is killing the equivalent of a child. Privacy would not override that or anything considered illegal. It would simply mean gov expects X crime done and based on a specific threshold is allowed to acquire said info from medical providers. One should not conflate wanting a desired outcome with it means the method makes logical sense.

Personally I am of the mindset gov should not be able to make laws against rights unless they can provide sufficient proof justifying the overriding of the right. E.g. yelling fire in crowded theatre. I do not see how abortion would meet such a threshold when one can not even prove the fetus is the equivalent of an alive baby at a particular stage of pregnancy.",1

Ideally we want to save it, but it must be making many people nervous because clearly there is no safety net or legal guard rail that prevents these kinds of modifications.

Individually, it's hard to predict a person's behavior or health outcomes.

Death is the easiest thing to look for because we have a nice system in place to track it, Most deaths, it's usually pretty easy to know what somebody died of, and it's final.

So we know that the rate of deaths for the entire country for car accidents is x per 100,000 in January... The rate of deaths for cancer is y per 100,000 per year. etc, etc, etc. It doesn't change that much year to year. It just doesn't. It's frighteningly predictable.

And when you just look at all-cause death rates year after year, it's basically a metronome. So when you see your overall all-cause death rate spike right as a new thing that can kill people is happening, you can be pretty damn sure that the new thing that's killing people is the cause of those increased deaths, regardless of what it says on any death certificate.

People want to think they're individuals, and nobody can predict the future, and that they get fat because of their genetics, and that they're special because their mommy said so. But, at least when it comes to statistics... nobody's special.

Relevant people are taking ""slander"" action with voting machines and I hope they win with that. What happened with Alex Jones is also a good step in the right direction but ""Slander"" is a difficult concept to work with. That doesn't mean that it should be utilised but there are a range of negative concepts e.g. slander, fraud, etc. that should be used in a legal setting.

The last thing to remember is that it is a core axiom for the GOP and their supporters that they don't care about whether what they believe and tell others is true or not.

"I believe Indiana already does that.  

I will explain but it's pretty involved.  Back in 2018 a catholic high school in Indianapolis fired a female guidance counselor who had worked there for 15 years because she was in a same-sex marriage.  Apparently it was common knowledge at that high school that she was in that same sex marriage.  The head of the Indiana Department of Education at the time was a democrat whose position at the time was voted on by the voters of Indiana.  She had a news conference saying she did not want to be considered to continue to be the Head of the Indiana Department of Education in 2020, because now the Head of the Department of Education was appointed by the governor, no longer voted on by the voters of Indiana and the administration was republican.  Someone asked her at this conference what she thought about the situation at that catholic high school.  She said she didn't think that any school that discriminated should receive tax money.  Indiana State Representative Bob Behning (Republican-Indianapolis) said that it wasn't the school that got the tax money, it was the parents and that if was an issue of religious freedom where the parents who received this money sent their kids.

I went to catholic schools for 12 years.  I left that piece of üí© religion 49 years ago at the age of 20.  I don't know how my head didn't explode when I heard Bob Behning's comment. I'm so sick of these people trying to shove religion on society.",1

I was about 10-12 and remember thinking, ""but liberals don't listen to this guy.""

I find reading news much better for my mental state of mind,1
"Can't do it.  Blood pressure.

I kept winding up yelling at my television like a crazy person within 5 minutes of turning Fox News on.  So, I stopped turning it on.

I don't necessarily need an outlet to be liberal to watch it, but if it's not liberal, it's got to at least skew to the center, be an objective news outlet free of opinion, or have people from both the right and the left who are credible and get equal time arguing with each other.

I actually only have a psuedo-cable streaming service half of the year to watch football, but when I do have it, I take Fox News and similar channels off of my personal channel list, and block all the recommended shows from said networks.

The last time I remember watching Fox News was the night when President Obama caught Osama Bin Laden, and that was the first time I'd seen it in several years.

I just don't see a reason to subject myself to Fox News' crap and help their ratings.  There might be some value in people monitoring it for like public officials and candidates who appear on it and say newsworthy things, or to keep up with threats their hosts and guests pose to democracy, human rights, rule of law, concepts like objective truth and science, social programs, continued support for Ukraine, and so on and so forth, but that's not my job.  I'll let all the other people handle that for me and let me know if there's anything I should be aware of.

I can only really take hearing Trump talking at length if it's a debate where Joe Biden is yelling ""Worst President ever!"" in the background. :)",1
"Worth mentioning:

NewsMax, presumably profiting from the advertising they show, used to offer it's feed to DirecTV for free.  Recently, they decided to charge DirecTV tens of millions of dollars on a regular basis for something they were getting for free up to a few weeks ago.

DirecTV made the business decision that not enough people watch that channel or subscribe to their service in order to watch that channel to pay NewsMax the new fee they were asking for.

This wasn't a political decision at all.  It was a business decision.  If NewsMax offered DirecTV their channel again for free tomorrow, presuming a contact of sufficient length so as not to have face demands for tens of millions of dollars all over again this time next year, DirecTV would probably air it.

Now, some satellite or streaming providers may air, just as Directv aired NewsMax when it was provided for free, similar free-to-the-cable/satellite/streaming-company stuff that may have minimal numbers of viewers and a minimal production value from the left wing as well as the right wing.  I think The Young Turks have a channel they offer around that is basically their left leaning radio show on television, and it's probably free to carry (I'm guessing.).

Channels like that often have low production values and even lower ratings, but they allow carriers to advertise that they have a much larger number of channels than they otherwise could advertise having, without spending a dime on some of said channels.

That's how you get all the odd religion channels that sometimes seem to be one long telethon trying to get people to send the preachers and their channels money, or that push a very politicized right-wing version of Christianity, or both.  Those channels approach the satellite company (Or whomever) and say ""Want a free channel that you can add to your channel count that will make the five people that call you every year saying they want to watch it very happy?"" and the satellite/cable/streaming company says ""Sure, why not?  We'll put it somewhere between channels 900-999 in our lineup."" (or wherever).

Some of the shopping networks get carried the same way.  In fact, it would not surprise me at all if some of the shopping networks actually paid the carriers to get placed in their channel lineup instead of usual situation with more popular channels, which is the other way around.

Conservatives who consider that censorship either don't understand the television business or are pretending not to understand the television business.

As the party of big business, you'd think that the Republicans would be all for market-driven decisons like this.",1

They don‚Äôt care about whether what they believe or tell others is true or not. For them and their tribe, their is only one genuine sin, losing. Any activity or position that upgrades their position in their eyes from the perspective of winning is ok (which once I understood this explained all the hypocrisy and their apparent projection and obliviousness to it). Any activity that downgrades their position is a sin no matter how righteous e.g. Liz Chaney.

Once I had that realisation, I no longer needed to watch because it then became simply the same bullshit repurposed with a new look. Hence things like cancel culture etc. are simply constructs for the same purpose and not something that requires any thought.",1

"""22 liberal channels""? What is this congresscritter smoking, and may I have some?

The only ONE I can think of that skews liberal is Free Speech TV (available as a Roku app or from its website, and some satellite carriers). It carries Thom Hartmann's show, it carries 'Democracy Now!' with Amy Goodman (itself available as a standalone Roku app), among other programs.

Let me put it this way: Those of us who are left of center have stayed put for the most part on most core issues (social and economic) while those right of center have gone so far to the right (especially on social issues) they've run past the goalposts and out of the stadium altogether. The funny thing is they have the gall to deride even mainstream Democratic Party members ""communists,"" not just the much-more left congressional cohort exemplified by, say, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or Primila Jayapal.

When I was younger I used to hate-read the then-Daily Oklahoman when Eddie Gaylord was still alive and running it, because it was a gobsmackingly blindly conservative rag in those days. I also used to hate-read The Lawton Constitution when the Bentleys still ran it, especially when they'd give their by-then (early 1990s) retired editorial page editor, Ted Ralston, a guest column -- outrageously hateful, homophobic git that guy was (disclosure: I was living in Lawton in those days. Let's just say I will never return there).

At one time I used to subject myself to the online edition of the Washington Times until I just couldn't take it anymore. I sometimes read the Daily Mail (UK), which is just garbage that reads like a tawdry tabloid and has earned the nickname ""Daily Fail"" for a reason. 

I can't bring myself to watch Fox News, OAN, or Newsmax. The little time I spend watching television--an appliance, to me, that in my house is largely only reserved for sports and whatever I want to stream, is too valuable to me to waste it on shite like that. 

In the second place, people should limit their viewing of any cable news, yes even MSNBC, because all cable news is profit-driven and needs eyeballs, and that means putting on the air whatever might attract those eyeballs. The only host I'll still watch on MSNBC is Rachel Maddow--who's only on once a week now (I'm a lot more interested in her long-form projects, also I think people forget she's not a journalist by formal training, but an academic who ""fell into"" journalism, and I rather like that she approaches her show with an academic's attitude rather than a journo's).

One nitpick: PBS NewsHour is indeed long-running--50 years--but the longest-running US TV program in history is also a news program: NBC's 'Meet the Press.' Assuming Chuck Todd doesn't run it into the ground between now and November, it will have been on the air for 76 YEARS (debut: November 6, 1947).",1

"When Newsmax and OANN popped up in the past 10 years, deemed more extreme than Faux News, I tried them out. OANN is hard to stomach. Newsmax appears to make an attempt at a perception of sanity.

There is actually more variety than one might expect. Some programs are more ""news-y"" albeit with an obvious preferred stance, like National Report, Spicer, and Greta, while others are straight-up propaganda, trolling, and scorn like Rob Schmitt and Gorka (ughhh), esp when they have hateful guests on like David Horowitz.

I saw DirecTV replaced Newsmax with something called The First, which is now home to Bill O'Reilly, so I'll need to check that out, though I hadn't heard of it.

Rs keep talking about how DirecTV is denying 13 million American households of Newsmax, as if 100% of the 13 million DirecTV households religiously watch Newsmax. In reality, barely 100,000 households watch Newsmax, across *all* cable providers and streaming platforms, which represents about 0.1% of the 125MM total TV households across the USA.",1

That's what it means to me.",1
"OED definition of liberal = broad.

What does this mean you say? 

Broad, as in many ways of accomplishing something. Many solutions. Many strategies to solving problems. One way may work for this group, another way may be better for another group. 

Liberal political theory fits very well with freedom and free markets which consists of providers producing a variety of goods and services through 3 main avenues: 1) the private sector, 2) the public sector, and, 3) the households. All three must be robust and thriving. Each has an integral role to play in a healthy nation state. People then can maximize their ability to solve problems.

The private sector mainly focuses on routine production (making dog food, building cars over and over), the public sector mainly focuses on thorny, complex problems and problems that are not profitable for the private sector (poverty, discrimination, public health and safety, justice etc). Households focus on individual level issues like raising good citizens, who are healthy, law-abiding, engaged in their communities. 

Now compared this to the word conservative which means 1 solution, the old solution. The status quo. As such it has always had a strong tendency to lean toward the power of authoritarianism by default because human nature wants to be creative and free, and conservatives don't want that ergo conservatism is always seeking to curtail these urges and passions. It also pairs well with exclusion, narrowing opportunity, creating false scarcity, and limits.",1

"To me liberalism is the ideology of both positive and negative freedom, where society should be built around the idea self-determination and mutually beneficial social contracts. It advocates for the rule of law, due process, and equitable justice. It advocates market economy, balanced by consumer-friendly regulations, and supports a safety net so people can continue to participate in the economy.

There are different species of liberalism, social liberalism, ordoliberalism, social democracy, etc. each with their unique characteristics. 

Myself personally, I would consider myself a socially moderate, fiscally liberal person. I tend to believe social programs are best served at the most local level possible.",1

D&I programs work their way into the hiring practices which turn each department into an affirmative action, quota-seeking body.

What's going on in the world?

>*After an unusual delay, the Supreme Court finally issued its first opinion of the term on Monday: a unanimous decision in Arellano v. McDonough siding against disabled veterans who seek compensation for disabilities related to their service. Justice Amy Coney Barrett‚Äôs opinion for the court denied these veterans (and their survivors) the ability to obtain benefits retroactively if they filed a late claim - even if the delay occurred because of their disability or some other factor beyond their control.*

Who among us is more deserving than the men and women who served and made sacrifices for our country? And their families, who were right beside them all the way?

It's unfathomable to me. 

And the minority decided pick their battles for another day? 

>*It‚Äôs a painful blow to military members who were injured while serving their country, and a puzzling one: At oral arguments, the justices sounded divided, yet all three liberals lined up behind Barrett‚Äôs harsh opinion. Maybe they genuinely believed that Congress intended to impose an exceedingly stringent deadline on disabled veterans. Or perhaps the three-justice minority is so outnumbered that it has decided to pick its battles, and Arellano was not worth the fight.*

Arellano experienced trauma after his honorable discharge. He did not know he was eligible for compensation until years later.

>*Because of his incapacitation, Arellano did not understand that he qualified for disability compensation. His brother did not find out until 2011, at which point he filed a claim on Arellano‚Äôs behalf, asking for retroactive benefits for the previous 30 years. The Department of Veterans Affairs granted compensation moving forward but denied compensation for the past three decades. It said that federal law allows retroactive compensation only if service members file ‚Äúwithin one year of discharge,‚Äù which Arellano had not.*

Congress did not want the law interpreted this way.

>*Shouldn‚Äôt the presence of so many exceptions indicate that Congress did not want rigid enforcement of the one-year deadline?*

Justice Barrets' interpretation left no wiggle room for the veterans and / or their families.

Leaving them to hang out and dry in the wind, as it were. Abandoned.

As if their sacrifice was their compensation.

WTH SCOTUS?

This was your first opinion? The first case you want the world to focus on?

Is this a further example of the horrors to come when it comes to other opinions waiting in the wings of America's hall of justice?

>*Barrett, a former civil procedure professor, ignored the principle of solicitude toward veterans in favor of a wooden analysis of the ‚Äústatutory scheme.‚Äù She focused on the fact that federal law includes 16 explicit exceptions to the general rule that veterans can‚Äôt get retroactive compensation‚Äîand equitable tolling isn‚Äôt one of them. ‚ÄúThe presence of this detailed, lengthy list,‚Äù Barrett wrote, ‚Äúraises the inference that the enumerated exceptions are exclusive.‚Äù Put differently, it is ‚Äúdifficult to see‚Äù why Congress ‚Äúspelled out a long list‚Äù if it did not want the list to be comprehensive.*

The __freight train of one term twice impeached disgraced former President Trump‚Äôs treachery and logorrhea__ still lingers, even after his failed __insurrection and miserably conniving__ attempts at *maintaining a stronghold* on the Department of Justice, political landscape, RNC, SCOTUS and the USA.

"If I was the lawyers in this case, I would have fought tooth and nail to get that vet an earlier effective date, and I would have pushed it just as far as these litigants did...

But this was a hail Mary. So basically, the law in question here (38 USC 5110(b)(4)) says you are entitled to an effective date equal to your date of discharge *if you were permanently and totally disabled at discharge*, and unable to apply for benefits.

Perm-total is a specific designation that applies to many *but not all* disabled vets who are 100% disabled. So you can have a disability rating of 100%, but not be considered ""permanently and totally disabled"" by the VA (which only really matters in a few very important instances, like this).

SO, the vets advocates in this case were trying to get the court to apply a fairness doctrine called equitable tolling, and expand 5110(b)(4) to cover vets who *are not perm-total* which would include me, and millions of other vets who could now flood the VA with applications for an earlier effective date.

Is it a loss for vets? Technically yes. Is it a huge kick in the pants for vets advocates trying to expand their benefits? Not really.",1

2. As commitment to the principle that individuals and organized groups of individuals are often the best source of information about themselves and that their voices must be heard in the quest to achieve number 1. In other words‚Ä¶ a belief in listening and responding to peoples‚Äô needs (especially those from vulnerable communities).

3. An opposition to the undue amassing of power by any individual, group, or organization over other groups. In practice this means limiting governmental, institutional, or corporate incursion of human and civil rights and also ensuring that individuals are not able to exercise that sort of power over others at the ground level. In other words‚Ä¶ advancing equality and limiting abuse.

4. A belief that DEMOCRACY (though imperfect) is the only moral system of government and that it‚Äôs institutions must be protected against damage, corruption, or negation to maintain the legitimacy of the government.

5. A belief that market economics (though imperfect) is the only system of political economy that most closely aligns with the democratic principles from principles 2 and 4 and the advancement of quality and quantity of life sought in principles 1 and 2 and that it‚Äôs negative externalities CAN and SHOULD be addressed with good policy to ensure it also promotes human rights.

- It is the Black person's battle against White superiority. 
- It is the woman's battle against the patriarchy and the notion that they are property, like the property of their father or their husband, or that they are baby machines, that their personal aspirations like their educational and career aspirations don't matter or are secondary. 
- It is the man's battle against the notion that his value lies in his ability to make money, how much power he has, and his ability to have sex with women. 
- It is the poor person's battle against the notion that he is less than or inferior to a rich person and is thus worthy of less and worthy of poorer treatment by society, police, etc.

The Bible may not tell people to not think but the religion of Christianity definitely does,1
"I'm sorry, but many of the fundamentalists I've known actively tell their people that relying on their own thought as opposed to what's taught in the bible is blasphemous.  And they don't talk about their beliefs being well thought out; they believe that whatever god ""said"" via the bible must be true regardless of whether it makes any sense, and even if it's contradictory.  Fundamentalist Christians, or the ones I've been exposed to (and I was born and raised in the Bible belt) do not respect scholars, only those who supposedly have received inspiration directly from god.  

I wasn't raised fundamentalist, and tho was Christian I was in fact taught to think for myself.  But these groups are absolutely not taught that.  I know they're in a minority among Christians, but the minority is growing.  And their ministers and pastors are more and more insistent that only what's written in the bible can be regarded as true and every word in the bible must be regarded as *literally* true.  

I do know that people who've never been directly exposed to these groups have trouble comprehending that people could believe this.  But it's real, and it's very scary.",1
Look at the redditors name. One true church. That should tell you everything in a nutshell,1
Indeed. The original sin was Adam and Eve eating the fruit of knowledge.,1
"I can't speak for fundamentalists as I am a Catholic. I am mostly talking about more traditional protestant groups (High Church Anglicans and Lutherans for example), Catholics, Orthodoxy, and Islam.

Also the whole George Santos thing.

It makes you wonder where that brazen confidence and lack of introspection comes from, and then the heinous rates at which dark money continues to pore into their coffers makes it all make sense.

A bit from this

Ask thought-provoking questions while being warm and curious. Be prepared to listen deeply. You will know if you have listened well if you can repeat back to them what they said. Be humble and open to hearing what they say.

  
Keep conversations positive, productive, and civil. Never get angry. Stay resourceful. It is better to end the interaction than to say something counter-productive. It is better to return to the conversation at another time, rather than the person cutting off all communication out of anger or fear.

  
Adopt a general tone of curiosity and interest in their positions. Pretend you‚Äôre an impartial counselor. Really try to get inside their beliefs.

  
Try to connect them with their authentic identity before these extreme beliefs. Remind them of past experiences together. Talk about the connection you once had and how you miss it.  


Don‚Äôt ‚Äútell‚Äù them anything. Help them to make discoveries on their own.

  
Try to get them to look at reality from many different perspectives. This can include many things.

  
Teach them about indoctrination and mind control. Use examples for which they have no attachment.

  
Use examples of cult leaders with similar qualities to their group's leader(s) and have conversations about it.

  
Share feelings and perceptions, not judgments. Use ‚ÄúI feel‚Äù statements. Don‚Äôt claim to be ‚Äúright.‚Äù Stick to what your perception is when reflecting back to them.

  
Ask a question and then wait for them to think and respond. Be patient. You do not need to fill silence.

  
Caution: an abundance of facts won't necessarily help. Do not overwhelm them with information, especially if it attacks the leader or doctrine.",1

 and none of them illegal and none of them involved a coup. What your link talks about (and i agree this was the plan) was not illegal. It was exactly working WITHIN the laws as currently stated which is why Pelosi recently changes the laws to make this plan harder to implement in the future. That's the opposite of a coup. That's working in the legal framework to affect change - LEGALLY.     
  
You said coup but you fail to show any evidence of an actual coup.

"The Superintendent is the CEO of a school district. If at a branch location a customer brings a gun into the store, threatens an employee three times, and three times the branch manager denies the employees request for backup because of policies put in place by upper management, the CEO will take the blame.

In this case the superintendent is taking the heat and is leaving and taking blame. That's a huge part of their job. Superintendents move around all the time and while they provide leadership to a district, they're also there to leave when needed to save the district facce. 

What needs to happen is the school admins get fired. If this happened at Target and the manager told the cashiers to ignore the crazy five-year-old with a gun, the managers would be fired instantly.",1
Sounds like there were systemic or previous issues going on and this was the tipping point.  Three teachers reporting a student with a wish to harm a teacher and a gun should have set off all kinds of alarms.,1

"The administration was notified four separate times of the allegations the child brought a gun to school. They searched his bag but not his coat or person. 

The last of four, the administration apparently directed the teachers to ‚Äúwait it out‚Äù because the end of the day was close. The child showed the gun to a classmate at recess and made them cry when saying if they told, the child would shoot them too. 

This is a bad take. The gun issue is of course a critical one, and the root of this problem. But firing people for gross negligence resulting in a person being shot is of no purse appropriate.",1
"Well we have to blame someone. And the teacher was the victim so it cant be him/her. We certainly cant blame the parents, parents are never at fault. We cant blame the principal because he wouldn't get the nice severance package the superintendent did and how would he survive? Yea the super will be fine.",1
In some organizations shit rolls uphill,1
"‚ÄúFired him‚Äù

They are giving him a half million dollars.",1
A few years ago after another shooting there was debate on whether to install metal detectors in Hampton and NN schools. The superintendent voted against it. So that‚Äôs why they fired him.,1
"Is this an argument for teachers to carry guns, so they can return fire when kids shoot at them? /sarcasm",1
"Damn straight. They had multiple reports that day alone, including a couple that he had a gun with / on him, and just ignored it, NBD (his *pockets* are *too small*), hoping he'd just go home with it and become someone else's problem. Plus you have a kid who is apparently so far off the rails, the requirement was that he needs a parent to accompany him in school, and then that's somehow the week they don't, so why is he even in the classroom?

That's definitely not on the teachers, it's not like they're given a choice about who's in their classroom. It's unclear how much blame rests on the principal, but that's what the investigation is for, they can still fire plenty more people if it's warranted, but they can safely start at the top for now.",1
"I think the reports (on the day of, at least) were to the school admin (ie the Principal and Vice Principals).

"Someone was negligent, so fire the superintendent without the due diligence needed to determine who was actually negligent. More controversially, it may have been long-standing policies that these people *properly* abided by that allowed this tragedy to unfold as it did. Policies can be the offending party, but we always must have human blood.",1
The superintendent isn't even at the school making day-to-day decisions. Maybe the principal or whatever administrator decided to ignore the repeated warnings?,1
"that's on the local school, not necessarily the superintendent...right?",1
As near as I can tell all the reporting happened during the day of the shooting by teachers and students to the administration. That would not percolate up to the Supe in any districts I am aware of. I don‚Äôt know how they came to the conclusion the Supe was to blame so rapidly,1

(Edit: Specifically to schools; they are *all* taking school shootings seriously. Teachers put their lives in danger - in a way that ought be unimaginable - simply walking into school just like the kids do. They have every reason to be *even more terrified* than most adults.

That the kid got the gun is proof that it was improperly secured. Hold the parents responsible.,1
I'm not saying the parents shouldnt be responsible but kids are not fucking stupid. If you can open the case with a key so can they. Stealing the keys/money/cigarettes  from moms purse is a time honored tradition. They can get chairs to get cookies and candy off the top of the fridge and a gun as well. There is nothing you can do to stop a kid from getting to it if you can access it. All you can do is make it take longer and not worth the effort unless they are determined.,1
That the kid got the gun is proof that it was improperly secured.,1
"If you know your kid has severe psychological problems and is threatening violence, and if you cannot keep your gun out of their hands, then get rid of the frigging gun!!!",1
"No it isnt. That isnt how the LAW works. The law specifies what properly secured it, not whether a child can figure out how to bypass the measures.",1
"I don't disagree. But then I don't carry or have a hand gun anyway since I think most reasons people have them are not good reasons. But for those individuals who work in certain jobs, live in certain neighborhoods and feel they need the gun just getting rid of it may not be an option. Should a police officer who has such a child not have his service weapon anymore?",1
"You are correct. The ""LAW"" sucks, and a significant part of the responsibility for that falls square on the shoulders of gun nuts who resist all regulation. Here's the applicable law in Virginia:

¬ß 18.2-56.2. Allowing access to firearms by children; penalty.
A. It shall be unlawful for any person to recklessly leave a loaded, unsecured firearm in such a manner as to endanger the life or limb of any child under the age of fourteen. Any person violating the provisions of this subsection shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.

B. It shall be unlawful for any person knowingly to authorize a child under the age of twelve to use a firearm except when the child is under the supervision of an adult. Any person violating this subsection shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. For purposes of this subsection, ""adult"" shall mean a parent, guardian, person standing in loco parentis to the child or a person twenty-one years or over who has the permission of the parent, guardian, or person standing in loco parentis to supervise the child in the use of a firearm.

....so if a kid gets hold of a gun without the parent's ""knowledge"", they are 100% off the hook. Irresponsible gun owners have little chance of being held responsible for misuse of guns, and I suppose that's the way most gun owners would have it, regardless of the usual blaming of deaths on irresponsible gun owners. I would wager most gun owners are in fact irresponsible, if not in securing their own guns, but in supporting reasonable gun laws that can actually hold gun owners responsible for the mayhem inflicted by their Constitutionally protected toys.",1
Not at his home if he can't keep it out of the child's hands.,1
"An if we change the law responsible gun owners will be going to prison despite their best efforts. If you put parents in prison for doing the right thing, the kid bypasses and still gets a gun there is no incentive to do the right thing and the parents will stop even trying. Our legal system is about punishing the actual guilty not the people who tried to do what they were supposed to and got screwed.",1
So you're saying no-one should own guns because no-one can keep them out of the hands of little children?,1
"I'm saying that locks and boxes aren't any better to keep guns from children than they are to keep thieves from your house and car. Determined individuals will bypass them.  

Education and making the children understand that they are not allowed to touch the gun is a better long term solution that relying on technical devices.",1

"I don‚Äôt care about what bathrooms are used, or what medical treatment they receive, people are people. What does concern me is the sports issue. I know we‚Äôre all just trying to be inclusive and supportive but the reality is there is a physical advantage for men in sports which has to be addressed delicately when discussing this particular issue. There is a reason we separate men and woman‚Äôs categories. It‚Äôs a difficult position to take, I know, but it has to be said.",1

"This. Tennessee continues to introduce bills every year with no real intention of passing them. They're just to confirm to the electorate that they sent the ""right man"" to the capital for them. Bills like forcing businesses with M/F restrooms to place warning signs, making the bible the State Book, forcing In God We Trust into public places, making it illegal to be gay, making it a felony to hold drag shows...on and on. Even for those that make it through, they're halted immediately by suit, and then thrown out by a judge. But that's not the point. Once again, the hillbillies sent the ""right man"" to the capital to waste everyone else's time and money.",1
"I think most people feel the same way.  I think people transitioning and becoming the gender they want to be is fantastic, but in competitive sports at any level, people born male will have an advantage over people born female.  Unless the transition began before puberty, which is obviously a whole other controversial topic.

My favorite sport is disc golf.  There was a pretty recent controversy involving this.  It ended up leading to the sport's governing body, the PDGA, making a rule that male to female transgender players cannot compete in the Female professional division in the sport's ""biggest"" tournaments unless they began to transition before puberty.

They can still compete in the Female division in lower tier tournaments if transitioning after puberty, but they have to prove that their testosterone levels are below a certain threshold, and that they have been taking the gender affirming hormone therapy for at least 24 months prior to playing.

To me, this is completely fair.  It allows MtF transgender athletes to compete as females in A-tier events and below.  A-tiers are not ""major"" tournaments, but you need to be an extremely talented disc golfer to be competitive in one at the open/pro level.  Winning an A-tier tournament is still a prestigious thing.  Also, a man can't just say ""I'm transitioning,"" begin HRT, and start competing as a female right away.

For reference, the vast majority of men that are competitive disc golfers would not be able to win an A-tier event competing only against women, or even get close.",1
But also it's unacceptable to be so precious about sports that it prevents people from living their best life.,1
"Ok sure, but you realize the importance of this issue is relatively minor compared almost anything. It's a game.

It's quite unbelievable that the legislature in Iowa (Republican majority) wants to try to get a waiver from the USDA to make sure people on food stamps can't purchase real food - like fresh meat.

>*A proposed bill could prevent Iowans who use the former Food Stamp Program from purchasing various pantry staples.*

The legislature wants to control the types of food they are allowed to purchase and prepare for their families.

>*A new bill introduced by Iowa House Republicans last week could drastically cut the types of food that people in the state can buy using Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits.*

They want to restrict food stamp recipients so that they can only purchase foods that families who are on the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Nutrition Program are allowed to purchase.

>*To safeguard the health of low-income women, infants, and children up to age 5 who are at nutrition risk by providing nutritious foods to supplement diets, information on healthy eating, and referrals to health care.*

Does anyone know why WIC was established? Do they care? 

It was specifically geared towards pregnant women and their children who, it was decided, need a certain type of food to nurture their bodies and their babies through important development stages in their lives. 

>*The proposed waiver would restrict SNAP purchases to items that appear on the state‚Äôs approved food list for a different federal initiative, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children. Also known as WIC, the program provides food assistance for pregnant people, new mothers and young children, and it is significantly more limited than SNAP. ""Iowans on SNAP would not be able to buy meat, flour, butter, cooking oil, frozen prepared foods,‚Äù Luke Elzinga, the chair of the nonprofit Iowa Hunger Coalition, told Iowa‚Äôs News Now. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a huge list.‚Äù In lieu of fresh meat, canned salmon and tuna would be allowed, according to a list of Iowa‚Äôs approved WIC foods. In addition to pantry staples like flour and oil, other prohibited items would include canned soup and sliced cheese. Only brown, and not white, rice would be permitted, and shoppers would have to swap white bread and pasta for 100% whole-grain versions.*

SNAP is totally different. It's for the entire family. They want to ban:

‚ñ† all fresh meat (and replace it with canned salmon and tuna only)

‚ñ† white rice (and replace it with brown rice)

‚ñ† flour

‚ñ† butter

‚ñ† cooking oil

‚ñ† frozen prepared food

‚ñ† sliced cheese

‚ñ† canned soup

‚ñ† regular pasta (and replace it with wheat pasta)

And what about people who can't eat the food listed above because of dietary restrictions?

And why no fresh meat?

Strange.

>*In addition to limiting eligible foods, the bill would also impose multiple restrictions making it more difficult for people to qualify for SNAP in the first place.*

And why make it harder to qualify for food stamps? 

Many people are on food stamps actually have jobs. Yet they don't make enough money to support their families and buy food. So the government gives them food stamps. 

Now, they want to add more restrictions to the ridiculous restrictions that already exist? So that people who really need food stamps will no longer qualify.

If you are poor? You can't save money or try to get out of your poverty status because the government is saying that you can't have any attributes of trying to improve your life.

My neighbor and his wife receive $ 517.00 per month for EBT / food stamps due to the pandemic. All food stamp recipients received additional food stamps due to the pandemic.

They just received a letter stating their EBT benefits will be reduced to $ 23.00 per month (after the pandemic EBT goes away), after  February 2023. They are on disability and they received an 8.9 % increase. 

The 8.9 % increase in no way, shape or form, makes up for the food benefits they are losing. Or the higher costs for goods and services they currently pay.

They are not the only ones.

It's very difficult for everyone.

Food Banks are closing, or not staying open as long.

People and corporate entities are not donating as much.

Shelves are empty.

Also? 

I think one of the worst things you can do is drastically decrease the pandemic level food stamp coverage so many Americans rely on.

And why are the Republicans supporting this proposed legislation to keep Americans and their families from real food? Including spices?

Do they think Americans, especially the disabled and elderly, deserve to be hungry?

It's not like the disabled and ederly can go get a job tomorrow to make up for all of the money that is being taken away from them through this proposed legislation.

Just? 

Why?

"They want to go back to the good old "". Government cheese"" when you had to get food from the government at certain places only. I remember when I got WIC for my kid. This is over 40 years ago and the kid had to be under 2. You could only get milk, cheese and I believe special k. There were no beans, or juice or anything like that. I personally don't think this list is terrible. It's having people eat actual good food instead of simple carbs and fat. The tuna and salmon are probematic because of mercury. As for  fresh meat, 6.99 a lb for one meal.for 4 to 6 people. ..while surely a 1.00 4 oz can of tuna( with mushroom soup and noodles) is enough for dinner...in their thinking. The suggested switches don't cost more and in some cases cost less. I was never able to eat lobster on food stamps, not sure why people think that's what being bought.",1
Poor people don't need food that's ridiculous.,1
Must punish poor people.,1
"They are stuck on the ‚Äúworthy poor‚Äù idea, are really afraid of the welfare queen myth, and are disproportionately concerned about the internet stories of people buying lobster or steaks with food stamps.

On a deeper level, they may also view poverty as a choice and want good food to be an incentive to climb out of poverty‚Äîas if anyone wanted to stay impoverished.",1

No",1
"There are articles out there about people standing in line behind people who are purchasing things like steak, lobster, scallops, or lamb, etc.

And they get angry about it and they write about it.

It goes on some complaint site.

There are currently no restrictions on what you can purchase with your food stamps in regards to the type of protein you are allowed to purchase.

IMO? 

If you want to purchase lobster and steak for you or your family?

And your food stamps offer the amount needed?

Do it.

I'm not going to tell someone that just because they are on food stamps, they can't have steak or lobster, etc.

I am not the food stamp judge.

And as of today? They have every right to do so where I live.",1
"If you are poor? Don't save money or try to improve your lot in life.

And don't eat food unless it's the kind of food that we say you can eat.",1
"So true. 

You hear stories every day about so-called welfare queens or kings. 

They were approved for food stamps. 

You have to jump through a lot of bells and hoops to get food stamps. 

They look at your bank accounts, your social security number, bills, rent or mortgage, paychecks, who you live with, and more. 

So what if you want to buy steak or lobster with your food stamps? You are allowed to do that.

So if you see someone in line buying these types of things? So what? It is food. It is purchased for their families. They will eat it. That is what food stamps are for.

I don't begrudge people buying whatever they need to buy on their food stamp allotment. Who am I to judge what they put in their mouths and stomachs?

After the pandemic level food stamps go away? Most people I know will go back to making less than $100 a month in food stamps.

My neighbor and his wife received a letter that their $ 517.00 pandemic level food stamp allotment is going to $ 23.00 per month (after February).

Not much.

"Speaking specifically on your proposals for the legislative branch, both of those ideas would never be passed into existence and are nonstarters.

What you seem to really be complaining about is the power of state government versus federal with respect to the number of citizens.

Furthermore, let‚Äôs say both your changes were enacted into law. Congress would become significantly less efficient than they are now. The new Senate you propose would just be a term restricted version of the current house. The new house would almost double in size with even more concentration of power into large states. 

Letting the federal government further meddle into states affairs will have disastrous long run consequences for an individuals freedom to vote. 

Unless your goal is to shift us away from a republic to an authoritarian state, these legislative changes would make matters worse.

The Constitution‚Äôs flaws have become ever more apparent as the country becomes more divided. For instance, a constitutional amendment requires the absurdly high approval of 3/4 of the states, an action that will never happen. Other provisions like the ‚Äú2 state Senator‚Äù rule and the 3/4 approval of moving through constitutional amendments may have worked in 1789 when there were only 13 states and the population of the country was only 3 million. It doesn‚Äôt work in a diverse, modernized country of 50 states and 330 million people.",1
"No it wasn‚Äôt, Thomas Jefferson is known for saying  that the Constitution, as it was drafted in 1789, was never supposed to last 200 years, but rather that a Constitution of sovereign nations were meant to last every 20 to 30 years before receiving an update. America is an outlier in this respect; other countries don‚Äôt have this strange reverence for their constitutions like America does and this is preventing progress from being made.",1
"Yeah arguing about updating the constitution is certainly valid! I for one would be all in favor of an update. We could modify some language that‚Äôs more applicable to 2023 and clarify what we mean instead of letting the Supreme Court interpret it. Second amendment being a prime example.

"The whole way classified documents is handled in the US is like a keystone cops episode. The more you find out about the way our government works, the more you go WTF.",1
"It should be investigated and if he's found to have done something wrong, he should be held accountable (see how easy that is Republicans?)",1
I‚Äôm just pissed that they are probably going to let trump off because of this and because they know republicans don‚Äôt care about all if the very important details.,1
"Biden and Trump need to face consequences for there actions, one was unintentional and when documents were found authorities notified and immediately turned over, the continued search of properties was not interfered with, the other was intentional, documents were taken, lied about the documents, ignored subpoenas, forced by search warrant to retrieve and lawyers hired to interfere with process.  Both Biden and Trump must face consequences and should be based on intentional and unintentional actions. IMO.",1
"Seems our government doesn‚Äôt keep very close watch over what are supposedly sensitive information. I mean, this is from like 9 years ago and it hasn‚Äôt been missed?",1
"Yes, I believe he should for the reason I thought Trump should be. These are classified documents that referenced methods, sources and people involved in several national security operations and it needs to be identified why they were not properly stored in a SCIF or vault, as is normally the case.  

I also believe it should lead to some serious reforms regarding how classified documents are handled by lawmakers in the legislative branch (since some docs he had date back to his Senate days) and executive branch officials because this is dangerous stuff that sends some signals to our adversaries we don't want sent.  


If anyone else did what he or Trump did, they'd be prosecuted.",1
"I think it‚Äôs interesting the investigation came out immediately after Republicans took control of the house and after McCarthy gave the extreme right what it wanted, to include appointing some of their own to key oversight and investigation committees. 

It‚Äôs interesting that Biden is being hit with and bathed basically with the same charges that Trump is‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs even more amazing how no one sees the connection here.",1
Biden needs to take his lumps and start planning for his replacement. I'd still vote for him again over any Republican but not sure others would. He's technically in a good position for a bait and switch where he can keep Republicans focused on him while Democrats quietly plan his successor.,1
"I'm waiting for more info.  What was the nature of the documents?  If they were covertly taken from a SCIF, hidden, lied about and willfully mishandled?  That's a crime that people do real time for.

We're they news stories that we're still classified after they were widely reported?  then I don't care at all.",1
I think this is more common then we realize. The only reason it came out was because of Trump. They needed to disclose it otherwise it would seem more fishy then it really is,1
I‚Äôm sick of hearing about it and the false equivalence. Come on my god it‚Äôs not hard to see the difference between the two,1
"Everyone has to be accountable to the law, regardless of the party, who we voted for, or what our personal feelings are about them. Biden is being investigated, as he should be.

Be that as it may, comparing the breadth and circumstances of what was found in Delaware to what was found in Mar-a-Lago is a false equivalence.",1
"I‚Äôd bet the farm that there isn‚Äôt a single elected official at the federal level that hasn‚Äôt mishandled a non zero amount of classified documents.

It does seem more like this was a case of ‚ÄúI took some work home and forgot some of it because I‚Äôm old‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúI took some secret documents home to hide and use for future gain‚Äù.

I think the context of the cases make them different but I don‚Äôt think he should be let off the hook just because I dislike him less.",1
Same as I do about the Trump documents,1
I think anyone who walks away with classified documents should be investigated,1
Yes it should be investigated. But so far nothing has indicated this is anything more than misfilled / lost paperwork,1
"My thoughts exactly. Pence should be investigated as well since classified docs were found at his home. Anyone who does this should be investigated. What I found laughable about Biden was his statement where he said everyone knows that he takes the handling of classified information very seriously. No no no you don't. Not when it's found in your garage, your house, your office and god knows where else. 

From the looks of it, they are all taking classified documents and they all should be held accountable. But will that happen? Very doubtful.",1
"It is a crime to have unauthorized classified documents.

https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCODE-2011-title18/USCODE-2011-title18-partI-chap93-sec1924",1
"The trump charges for the documents was never going to be much, if at all. His real issue (charge wise) is obstruction. Lots and lots of obstruction. I never had much hope, and I have less now. But I still have some hope.",1
"No they weren‚Äôt covertly taken, they weren‚Äôt even on the archives list of items checked out. Bidens team found and reported them, then went looking for more just in case. This is all publicly available info right now",1
Not if it's by accident. Bless your heart.,1
Yeah... It says that right there in the US code. Unless it's by accident.,1
Thanks but I'm going with the actual prosecutors on this one. And Davis Petreous.,1
"It's not about trust at all. Conservatives don't want a liberal democracy which is what America and the West was founded on. When conservatives say freedom what they mean is freedom from a liberal democratic government and replacing it with a fascist authoritarian dictatorship. This cannot be fixed. If you want a liberal democracy you need to fight for it and the moment you stop fighting for it, it will die.",1
"Of course we can't trust them to be decent. We can trust them to act cruelly and ignorantly.  
They purposefully spread a deadly disease.  
They put a Russian asset into the White House.  
They stormed the capital, killed police officers and tried to prevent the transfer of power.  
They supported the nomination of liars to the Supreme Court and celebrated when women's right to abortion was taken away.  
The threatened violence upon election workers, government officials and school board members.  
Nah.  We know what they are and what they will do given the chance. If we trust them again, shame on us.",1
"I hate to say it, but I think that the majority of neo-fascist conservatives are of the baby boomer generation (not all obviously but a good percentage). I'm hoping things get better when they are gone.",1
"The only way to regain trust in the system is to stop conspiracy theorists and racists from getting elected. Their wins have given rise to the idea that it's ok to be openly racist. When that happens, their numbers and influence grow. We have to remove the cancer, not get along with it",1
"There are parts of America so incredibly different from others they may as well be another country.  If we can‚Äôt find a way to bring us all back together, maybe a divorce is best for all.",1
"I think people need to understand that both sides lie and say whatever to get elected. I‚Äôd also wager that present day Washington is a facade and outside influences pull the strings which is why Trump was attacked harder than any other President in history. He‚Äôs not a purchased insider. The liberal left LOVED him and he‚Äôll Oprah even interviewed the guy asking years ago if he‚Äôd ever run in which he at the time didn‚Äôt want to. Once he announced then the attacks began. He was a threat to the agenda in place. 4 years kill lots of momentum so 8 years would have derailed a ton of items like Great Reset, social credit or carbon credit scores being floated now.",1
Covid broke this country for good.,1
"Well, that explains why nobody is enlisting in the armed forces. Because we‚Äôd be fighting so they can continue to make our lives miserable. 

We fight with our apathy and our ballots. We ignore their pleas for cooperation when they want it, we vote in every future election.",1
"That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm convinced in the next ten years AMERICA WILL DIE. Their precious union will dissolve because they chose to be ruthless, they chose to be violent, they chose to be unreasonable and we had to make the tough decision to dissolve the union entirely and build walls to keep THEM away.",1
"These people definitely had the worst Christmas ever. Explains why these Christian conservative families seem to be falling apart at the seams during the holidays nowadays. 

But my grandma isn‚Äôt a bad person, the one on my dad‚Äôs side. She‚Äôs a sweet old lady. She even baked me a cake for my birthday last year. üòÅ 

I know when she eventually passed away I‚Äôll be crying and mourning for days and I‚Äôll be giving her hugs in my dreams just like I do with my grandfathers when I see them in my dreams. Unlike the fascist baby boomers, they were great people. 

As for Conservative Republicans‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs a reason why things keep getting worse for them. Bad people reap bad lives.",1
"I agree with you. Problem is, if they run around like children and shout ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Tread On Me!‚Äù And act like they‚Äôre untouchable because they are crazy lunatics, eventually that gets too old for us and we start asking ourselves if being in this shoestring union is even worth the heartache.

There‚Äôs a difference between being cancer and being a doctor that wants to help people who have cancer. Cancer kills people and ruins lives and destroys families, cancer doctors, or oncologists, want to save lives and keep people from vast human suffering. 

America should 100% be asking itself moving forward if the current state of affairs is worth fighting for in the eyes and minds of its citizens. Because there‚Äôs not much trust, if any at all, between the citizens and between Americans.",1
There is almost no other part of the country that isn't at least 50% liberal across the board. The problem is the electoral college has skewed our democracy to make it appear we have a more event split across voters than we really do. Republicans are a minority. The electoral college needs to be fixed to provide what the Constitution promised and that is all voters are equal and have an equal vote.,1
"As tragic and sad as it seems, you‚Äôre right. A country like this in this world and with this amount of division, calling this country ‚ÄúUnited‚Äù is just irony at this point. 

If we can‚Äôt change, then a divorce is sadly up America‚Äôs alley.",1
"The liberal left never ""loved"" him. He was tolerated. It was during his campaign that he revealed more faults in his character and once he was in power, it became clear that he only wanted more. trump is the worst thing to happen to America in my 60+ year lifetime, and he has exposed all of those on the right for what they are.",1
Hope that $800B Aircraft Carrier was worth it üòÇ,1
No one is listing in the arm forces because people are much more informed today than they were during the Bush era and no one wants to die for another oil crusade by a right-wing fascist Republican.,1
I guess Republican Conservatives have never heard of the term ‚ÄúKindess is its own reward‚Äù. Kindness makes kind people and kind people make more kindness in return. Same works when you only choose to give people reasons to want to keep you as far away from their loved ones as possible.,1
"Absolutely. I‚Äôm 24 years old and even I know that Republican Conservatives are not the brightest or the best. They‚Äôre the worst in many ways. 

In general, I think the best way to describe their sentiment is that they only care about THEMSELVES and THEIR MONEY. That‚Äôs a great way to describe it. 

If they hate something, they‚Äôre gonna ruin it (like women‚Äôs rights to abortion). If we hate something, they‚Äôre gonna hurt us as much as possible so we don‚Äôt ruin it for them. (gun control legislation is a great example) 

They are the bad guys. They‚Äôre the bad guys because they treat others like garbage and through their actions they give us solid reasons to want to end the union; because we can‚Äôt let them hurt our families and our communities. They‚Äôre a THREAT to America‚Äôs future. And they don‚Äôt care. They‚Äôll keep screaming ‚ÄúDON‚ÄôT TREAD ON ME!‚Äù until America dies. And even then, they‚Äôll be violent lunatics.

We CAN‚ÄôT trust them to do the right thing. 

If tomorrow they choose to do a complete 180, expel people like MTG, Matt Gaetz, Clarence Thomas, Ted Cruz and Mitch McConnell from Congress, admit they were wrong and that they should‚Äôve been focusing on the stability of our union and bringing equity and equality to all civilians, passing gun responsibility legislation that will prevent mass shootings, focusing on diplomatic relationships between The US and Mexico as well as other territories, focused on fighting back against climate change and helping ALL PEOPLE FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE? Really ensuring that America HAS A FUTURE AT ALL? I‚Äôll have a whole lot of apologies to dole out.",1
"Like I said though, there‚Äôs bigger fish to fry. Can we fix this trust problem in America before America dies? 

I don‚Äôt know. I have genuinely no clue.",1
Or die so they can come home and be discarded and treated like trash like the last round of military vets,1
And the ones before that.,1
I‚Äôm perhaps unduly bothered by the misuse of their and incorrect punctuation on display here.,1
Most right wingers/hardcore evangelicals/fundamentalists are anti catholic.,1
"It used to be that Catholics were indeed a pariah politically. The assumption, largely more anti-immigrant than anything, was that Catholics were more aligned with Rome than ‚ÄòMurica. 

When Catholics were considered more ‚Äúethnic,‚Äù they were more likely to vote Democratic. The Roe decision and the hard right shift of the U.S. Conference of Bishops changed that.  

Historically, if you want an anti-Catholicism in politics, check out Al Smith‚Äôs Presidential campaign in 1928 and what the Hooverites flung at him.",1
"The KKK has been traditionally anti-catholic so, probably more than you think.",1
"I would imagine that there are quite a few republican evangelical members of the House and Senate that think only people that believe exactly like they do are christians. They usually also feel people that are not christiasns are not good people. We all know who these members are. Think of the people that are always spreading their hate and fear mongering of ""those people"".",1
There,1
Go read article VI of the US Constitution,1
"Although we seem to have a significant Catholic delegation embedded at the Supreme Court, there's no justification for anti-anyone politicians. It would suffice that they pursue the interests of the voters and not the Vatican's.",1
Church and State are separate.,1
Yes! They are called Protestants!,1
"What do you mean by, ""anti-Catholic?""  There are these priests that won't give Joe Biden Communion because he is pro-choice.  Does that make Joe Biden Anti-Catholic? I remember driving to work one day, and I was listening to some religious show on the radio, and the guy on the radio was railing against papists-I mean to the extent that the Pope shouldn't exist.  He was definitely anti-Catholic, but I didn't want anything to do with his type of anti-catholicism.  So I think your question is a little too vague.",1
"I think you will find a fair bit of that in fundamentalist and evangelical churches, particularly ones that are independent congregations with no theological oversight.",1
My grandmother (the racist one) wouldn't vote for Kennedy because of his Catholic beliefs. She was awful,1
"President Biden, Nancy Pelosi, Mallory Morrow (MI), the Kennedys were, just to name a few.",1
"Note: As a politician, you will not survive as an avowed anti-catholic",1
"Was going to say that. 

You do have some Republican Catholics‚Ä¶.like you also have some Republican Jews but the mass majority of them

That changed in the civil rights era in some areas though,1
"When I was growing up evangelical, I think most peoples' perspective was that Catholics were ""saved"" but misguided. I specifically remember ""If you declare with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."" So I figured that was pretty clear that any Catholic who fit that bill got a ticket to heaven.",1
"We all know (from voting patterns) that conservatives care nothing for any children but their own, but because of the anti-abortion thing repugnicans will take any and all Catholic votes and say nothing of their private ""differences"".",1
"Officially, yes. In practice, no. Not at all.",1
"Biden is catholic.  If a priest refuses him communion, that is on the priest, not Joe.

Also, the pope ordered they provide him communion, so they are the issue, not Joe on this one.",1
I think mass majority of Catholics are republican. I‚Äôm a catholic democrat and am constantly criticized for my politics. People say I‚Äôm not a true catholic if I‚Äôm democrat. It‚Äôs terrible in the dating world. Very hard to find a catholic man that is moderate or liberal politically. At least in the Cincinnati area,1
"Yea, no. Most Catholics are conservative and Republican these days. Especially since Roe v. Wade in 73. You can blame that on Pat Buchanan (a Catholic) and Nixon. There is a reason the Federalist Society picked all Catholics for the Supreme Court.",1
"I once read Tim Tebow's father's website. It had on there that something like 75% of all Filipino people have never heard the word of god. At the time I looked it up and I think 95% of Filipino people were catholic. He also had derogatory things to say about ecumenical religions, which catholisism is one. I know people that believe only a baptism as an adult makes you a christian so the childhood baptism of catholics does not count.",1
I find it amusing that you think republicans care about their own children. They only care for the straight boys. Girls and any member of the LGBTQ+  community are second class citizens at best.,1
"Then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who is also Catholic, was also threatened with being denied communion because of her pro-choice stance.

I've not heard of this being levied against two other Capitol Catholics: Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA, who was Hillary Clinton's running mate in 2016), and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY14).",1
"This is true of white Catholics, but not Catholics overall",1
Yeah it‚Äôs bc the white Catholics in America have aligned themselves with the conservative Americans that look like them even if the views are antithetical to their faith.,1
"If they ever become powerful enough, they will get their turn.",1
I feel like finding a catholic democrat in my area is like a needle in a haystack! They are so focused on abortion.,1
It makes me so upset bc they tell me MY democrat views go against the faith teachings. They just cherry-pick. It‚Äôs all about abortion. What about the poor? What about the death penalty? The environment that we are blessed with?,1
Look at the [demographics here](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/religious-landscape-study/religious-tradition/catholic/party-affiliation/). What you‚Äôre saying is true if you‚Äôre looking for a white Catholic man. Less so if a woman or non-white.,1

The College Board has not publicly released the course framework & it‚Äôs not available (as far as I‚Äôm aware or have seen) In part because the course is still in development. 

However, previously during a pilot program of it, one Florida teacher (who taught the course) discussed some of the topics covered in more detail in this article [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/31/us/ap-african-american-studies.html?unlocked_article_code=qfdZhnz5-aqOqyU9cgVDqHXzRW36qrpLqOsI-0RoiRQ0wfX7ikLM4KvQ9z42su8qbH5jveU1yzXzh1V2mzl4RXakc3h7ieINj60WrddcWEMLlU50MAAcarYszBcQ0_aEfC4jKtkFNf8vaV4teV99Bfs4GSrZ-xD2_46UENkX63SBM7ozaWO54z47RfOEyHg1d8bVL1BJEzXOqLikUFrG-vy222I93xn8mQnJEz_-BXbTuuyk_kVm2w7ogUwbIYm7pTFgzYtCcQn4nQTz8JmIGbtqt4z0e2jOvfh0fQm3-sPZUfjXECuEdXHHTeVVEYayb59q2YirLJ4AAaMA8GRu2w&smid=share-url). They said though ‚Äúthat this course is a comprehensive, mainstream course about the African American experience.‚Äù 

When this teacher taught it (before DeSantis‚Äôs rejection) they had *not* been ‚Äúworried about falling afoul of [Florida] laws that aim to restrict education about race.‚Äù Convincing me more so that this rejection was about optics & pandering more than any ‚Äúcontent issue‚Äù with the course.",1

She actually said those three probably wouldn't remember the party because it wasnt memorable. She passed a polygraph too.

Are you defending the White House's handling of this trickle-truthed scandal?",1

This new AP class is part of a small pilot program by the College Board (which oversees AP studies) that involves 60 schools (around the US) out of 26,000+. This pilot program is being tested until 2024, as noted on the College Board website. Pilot began in 2022.

Out of 4000+ colleges in the US, currently only 200 will accept the pilot credit for this AP class have committed to accepting credit for this class or will accept it once the pilot period is over. More colleges will commit to it once the refining process of this class is complete.

I felt that clarification was important to note as the title of the article reads to be somewhat misleading. How anybody feels about it beyond that and after reading the article is certainly up to them.

*Edited to include more information.*",1
"They can't get sued. Or rather, such a lawsuit would be thrown out; this is a pilot AP class. It's not an official AP class as AP African-American studies was only just implemented in 2022 on a test basis. The governing body of AP classes is College Board and  they've currently enlisted 60 high schools in this pilot program. Through this test period, College Board will make changes and refine the class over before releasing it as something official. This needs to happen before the majority of colleges agree to accepting credits for this class.",1
"Since you put such an emphasis on new, is there and *old** AP course that is taught in Florida?",1
You said it‚Äôs not banning the class it‚Äôs just banning the class. In more words,1
I don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs that‚Äôs a relevant distinction,1
"While that isn't a ban directly, the fact that it ""violates state law"" shows that it is effectively a ban. Imagine if a Nazi came to the conclusion that Jewish-German history violates German law, you know the real reason for it.",1
Thank you.,1
defendants can ALWAYS be sued,1
"No. In fact there is no old AP for this anywhere.

This is a part of a pilot program by the College Board ,(they govern and regulate all AP classes in the United States) that launched in 2022 among 60 schools out of 26,000 high schools. From the pilot phase they'll decide what to adjust within it the class.

Out of 4000+ colleges in the US, currently only 200 will accept the pilot credit for this AP class.

Once the AP class has been refined, most colleges will commit to accepting it as college credit.",1
Yes I don‚Äôt see the distinction here. It‚Äôs literally banning the class.,1
"It's relevant in that there is no ""old"" AP class of African American studies. This is currently a pilot program (started in 2022) being applied to a limited number of high schools (60) by the College Board, which governs and regulates AP classes.

College Board is still making changes and refining this course ad the pilot program continues through 2024. Open to input from States and districts where the pilot program is occurring. The governor of Florida has already stated his concerns about some of the content in the AP class, which the New York Times article addresses.  The NYT article also noted that Florida would be open to reinstate in the pilot program if these issues were addressed.",1
"And‚Ä¶ DeSantis said you can‚Äôt teach it in Florida. How does focusing on this nuance chance anything?

Ok, so it‚Äôs still being refined‚Ä¶ so they won‚Äôt participate in even improving it? And oh by the way, the article mentioned one of the 60 pilot schools this year was in Florida.",1

I think they know without doing sone drastic ahit that they would ""die off"" or slowly fade away. The majority of the party. 
Be prepared I'd say. It's gonna be a wild ride and not in a good way.",1
But then who would replace him?  Devil you know vs Devil you don‚Äôt‚Ä¶.,1
The GOP already made it clear they're going to ignore the Dems if they try that,1
McCarthy is a dick anyways,1
One person can call for a vote to remove him.,1

"Is it ""affordable"" now?",1
"Used Obamacare once, it was pretty bad. I‚Äôm SURE it was a scammer who got my info but once I got a job again I had someone call from a number that WAS a government number‚Ä¶while it was free healthcare and the lowest quality possible, they said that their records show I am working again and asked for the back pay of the cost of the healthcare. 

Like it was free until I got a job and then it‚Äôs paid by me afterwards‚Ä¶I never paid it and went off on them so why I assume it was a scam call via a data leak. Spoofed number perhaps.

It was when Obama was still in office. It for sure needs improvement, by like‚Ä¶.a lot!!",1
"My neighbor pays $ 1.25 per month.

It used to be $ 8.11 per month.",1
"So what healthcare do you have now?

Btw, it's the ACA. 'Lowest quality possible' Explain? 

There are guarantees, ie: annual physicals, no lifetime limits, guaranteed coverage ( no preexisting condition denials) etc..

 If you're employed and covered by the employers health insurance, that's good. If you're on your own, the alternatives aren't good..",1
"I remember. Obamacare was very expensive. It was great for the poor, and for people with pre-existing conditions.  It took care of a lot of headaches.  But for middle class people who were self-employed who needed to provide their own insurance, it was very expensive.",1
"Until I switched jobs, I was paying $600 a month for just me and my daughter. Luckily we found an employer with good benefits. The Democrats were dead set against socialized medicine, and will always be.",1
"Obamacare continued the same song-and-dance that we had before Obamacare.  High premiums force you to take the lowest possible coverage.  Then the next year they raise your rates, so you raise your deductible. Then the next year, they raise your rates again, so you switch to another provider (if there is one available). Then the next year they raise your rates. And so on.",1
That's a lie. ONE former Democratic senator (Joe Lieberman) was against the public option and said he would support a filibuster if Democrats included it.,1
Funny how there is always that one loud voice that won‚Äôt go along and forces the rest to give up their dream.,1
"The Democrats were weak-willed, and lacked leadership, but they were slaves to the private healthcare system. Do you actually think Pelosi or Biden ever gave socialized medicine a second look? Or Obama for that matter?  
And even the ""public option"" was a weak substitute for the great healthcare systems they have in other countries.  
Obamacare was a gift to the private healthcare industry.",1
You obviously don‚Äôt understand the filibuster,1
"Lieberman has been gone for a decade!  What have the Democrats done to move us closer to socialized medicine? Biden's ""improving Obamacare"". Is Lieberman still stopping him?",1
Conservatives are liars and hypocrites?!?! No way!,1
"DeSantis is Trump 2.0.  We must fight like hell to never allow him into the oval office.  Sick fascist.

No more Trumpians in office!",1
Those companies are like a person that is being abused.   If I try just a little bit more then maybe I won't get hit tonight.  DeSantis has the stench of desperation about him.   He so wants to be president so he can be an even bigger bully.,1
Backroom benefits for these companies? Things are never ax they seem.,1
"Jesus Christ are Republicans trying to dress like Serena Joy now?

I always suspected the Wives' outfits were influenced by Melanie Trump but I wasn't sure since _The Handmaid's Tale_ show was in development before he was elected.",1

Right? Something I try to remind myself of daily.,1
Same as if the only news comes from Republicans. But no one said that was the only source of news they were looking for. If they are on Truth Social then they clearly aren't only getting news from Democrats.,1
"Passively agree. But I frequented republicans news for a better picture of what the country is thinking and seeing. I ask my mom to send her republican news clips she is interested in. 

But I lean left, or left currently. I think I'd normall fall center, or center right. But the scale has moved in the past decade. 

I don't trust most news now. It's all designed to poke at a some group or demographic.",1
"She was the first to be bounced out in the primaries, she‚Äôs a bad pick.",1
"She doesn't inspire me,  her stump speech is boring. Sorry to say but I believe that is super important. Ideas and policy should be the focus. It's not!",1
"This is the only way we lose to Trump.

The single most striking thing I've learned working in politics is how unabashedly racist and misogynistic this country is, more even than one would suspect on the surface. Obama won because he was a generational political talent. Kamala ain't that.",1
"I liked her in Senate hearings and was excited when she started her campaign, but she had no traction.

Some candidates don't do well, but are good candidates who maybe run at the wrong time or something else is an issue. I feel that Booker is a good example. I don't think that's the case with her. It's just not her strength.",1
Nope...,1
"Why? My impression of her is that she is a terrible leader and a bad boss.

Why would we want her as VP let alone Pres?",1
I'm not sure she could beat Mitt to be honest.,1
Biden is going strong just look at the Midterms,1
"as much as I want to back this I feel like Pete has a better chance, Smart, Vet, quick with a good but not controversial come back, young so he'll connect with millennials better.  Really struggling to find a downside to him other than all red states completely losing their shit over the obvious stuff but they lose their shit over everything so no matter who runs they'll hate them no matter what, might as well as put one of our most promising candidates forward.  His running mate, fuck it how about AOC so we can get some progressive input/ representation, honestly that ticket would sing so well to the millennials/ gen z's that they would come out voting in full force.",1
Absolutely not. Horrible pick.,1
Nope! Not her. She was a terrible choice for Veep and would be a disastrous president.,1
HELL no,1
Biden shouldn't run at all and Kamala should run in a primary like everyone else.,1
She doesn‚Äôt really stand a chance I don‚Äôt think. Especially against DeSantis or Trump. Those two can rally people behind them and Kamala doesn‚Äôt have that mass appeal. Kamala v Desantis would be a steamroll in my opinion as deSantis not only has a political spotlight on him but since he also is viewed by some Republicans as more moderate because he doesn‚Äôt make as many mean tweets but he still ‚Äúowns the libs‚Äù.,1
Throwing away the presidential incumbency advantage is strategic malpractice,1
"Not many people like her. She can‚Äôt even speak coherently at times. Probably someone else. DK who, but someone",1
Why not neither?,1
Someone would have to find her first. Laziest vice I've ever seen.,1
"Nah, we need a fresh face.  I‚Äôm not sure who that is but it shouldn‚Äôt be Biden or Harris.",1
Who?,1
Some one who fights for progressive agendas should be,1
I wouldn't mind if she does.,1
"What executive capacity or legislative capacity has Kamala shown that makes you think she'd be as good or better at the job than Biden? Her 2020 campaigned failed due to mismanagement. As a former prosecutor, my read is her 'best self' will be in the Federal judiciary. Maybe on SCOTUS when Clarence Thomas dies...",1
"Not a chance. One issue that makes her an immediate no-go is that she is part of the prison problem, one of the worst as a prosecutor and AG.",1
If the GOP runs Lauren Boebert then maybe.,1
"Newsome & Katie Porter, 2024",1
I was a big time Kamala fan. I preferred her over Joe. But what has she done?  She only appears when there is an African American cause.  I‚Äôm not a Joe fan either. I would love Jeffries or Pritzker.,1
I love kamala but no that wouldn‚Äôt be a good idea.  I do agree that I hope he doesn‚Äôt run.  I want someone more aggressive.  You are a trump fan tho and you know this would give him a chance to win lol,1
I prefer to win,1

That's silly.",1
"With you, Joe is just too old, period.",1
You must be too young to remember Dan Quayle.,1
"You say this based on what metric?  VPs are never in the news, so how do you know what she's done/hasn't done?",1
"So because you personally can‚Äôt see her doing things, she‚Äôs lazy? How do you know what she‚Äôs doing or not doing? Were you always staying updated on Pence, and if so, how?

She‚Äôs traveling to Arizona today.",1
"I like both Katie Porter and Pete Buttigieg.  Katie Porter is unlikely to run as she‚Äôs going after a CA Senate seat and Pete Buttigieg, while exceedingly smart and well spoken didn‚Äôt seem to generate much momentum in the primary, so I‚Äôm not sure how he‚Äôd do this time around.",1
Someone who can get elected should be.,1
Look at her competition in that primary. They all sucked.,1
Didn't you watch her as a candidate?,1
He‚Äôs 80!! Stop being ridiculous.,1
okay that's definitely a ticket I can get behind,1
"I personally loved the part where they criticized her ability to speak coherently, but couldn‚Äôt even use complete sentences to do so. They probably not smart.",1
Period. Joe will lose to anyone under 70 years old. He loses to DeSantis. He loses to any of those fascists on the GOP side. We need youth and solid communication skills.,1
If they are they can't spell potato,1
If someone you vote for gets elected but doesn't represent your values that's ok?,1
You don't like his performance so far?,1
I'd rather have someone who represents 70% of my values and gets elected as opposed to someone who represents 100% of my values and doesn't get elected.,1
"He‚Äôs doing fine; however, it would be nonsensical to elect an 80 year old as POTUS. I‚Äôve been wanting youth for 7 years now. As much as people pretend it doesn‚Äôt matter, age *is* a factor in our decision making and abilities‚Äîit‚Äôs the same reason why you can‚Äôt be under 35 and run for president. 

It‚Äôs time for a big dose of reality. People decline as they age.",1
"Ron DeSantis is youthful, and would definitely take the country backwards, and undo the progressive policies Joe Biden has enacted.

Age *is* a factor, which is why Biden is doing amazingly. It‚Äôs because of his decades of experience and wisdom. You‚Äôve been wanting youth for 7 years now? Oh I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre so *parched* and *dehydrated*. It‚Äôs competence and safety you should want.

Trump‚Äôs issue wasn‚Äôt his age. It was the policies he enacted.",1
"Fine. Let‚Äôs watch how the 80 year old does when he‚Äôs up against a smooth-talking youthful fascist. 

I‚Äôve seen how this country votes. It wouldn‚Äôt end well. 

I will hope I‚Äôm wrong.",1
"The 80 year old who has the incumbency advantage and the increasing approval ratings?

There is no one better equipped to defeat whoever the Republican nominee is. Who would you prefer anyway? You haven‚Äôt made any suggestions. Kamala Harris? She would lose.",1
Pete Buttigieg! I‚Äôve been a fan since 2019. He‚Äôs exactly who this country needs‚Ä¶.if the oldsters would move the hell out of the way.,1
"I love Pete Buttigieg. He‚Äôll make a good president someday. I don‚Äôt think Buttigieg would have been able to accomplish getting senior citizens on Medicare the $35 monthly insulin cap. He doesn‚Äôt have the decades of experience, wisdom, and Rolodex of Capitol Hill relationships that Biden does. He knows how the sausage is made, and would probably make a joke about how he‚Äôs so old that he *invented* the sausage.

I voted for Elizabeth Warren in the primary, and with hindsight I can now see that Biden is the perfect person for president right now.

Look at what else he‚Äôs making a priority:

https://www.npr.org/2023/01/02/1146045412/biden-diverse-federal-judges-women-black-appeals-courts

They want the citizens to have the power to use force and throw out a government that does not work and defend the constitutional republic.

As it is citizens already are unable to HAVE assault weapons unless grandfathered in from long ago. It was never really contested. The AR15 is not an assault weapon and people saying AR means assault weapon just makes themselves look stupid, uneducated. You can hate firearms, that‚Äôs your right‚Ä¶but they take paths to protect and defend the constitution which includes 2A, the only right that says ‚Äúshall not be infringed‚Äù.

In fact, every Republican President since and including Reagan (who cut the rich's taxes IN HALF) have issued tax cuts for the elite. Only Democrats (primarily Obama) issued tax cuts for the middle class because those are the ONLY tax cuts that actually stimulate the economy.

The multiplier effect of money: Why ONLY middle-class tax cuts help the nation! When an average citizen receives additional money, he spends it. Which increases the incomes of the retailer, shipper, manufacturer, wholesaler, etc. Which they spend, increasing the incomes of retailers, shippers, etc. Thus 'raising all boats' and increasing the GDP. Giving primarily to the rich as Republicans do just adds zeros to tax-free foreign accounts with no resulting benefits to the nation.

Cooperation may cast doubt on a conspiracy charge, but gross negligence that endangered the country? Yes. That‚Äôs easily immediate resignation territory.",1
It's also funny that Trump was hounded for lying about and refusing official orders to return the documents in question and it sounds like this latest batch was found locked in an old office Biden used when he was VP. Biden wasn't necessarily hiding them there and they were secured in an office that sounds like it is still being used by the government,1

Every other news network now doing the reverse for Biden. Is this lost on you?,1
I think the issue was in one case there was a refusal to return the documents. In the other they are working to track down and return everything. Whatever the case may be it is frightening that so much classified info is mishandled. The tracking systems aren‚Äôt working.,1

Trump is already gone, but Biden is currently the President‚Ä¶ he and his cabinet should resign immediately. This is something we can all agree on. Criminal charges? That can be dealt with later, but first step is to resign.",1
I thought this place was ‚Äúliberal‚Äù not ‚Äúdemocrat‚Äù. But it seems like you‚Äôre right.,1
Which one refused to hand over documents even when subpoenad? Thought so.,1
Presidents like tangerine tyrant and Joe Biden are embarrassing.  There will be no resignation and I predict Biden will actually lean into it when the investigation finds no wrong doing.  In the end the average voter doesn‚Äôt care about classified documents. It‚Äôs a nothing burger.,1

How many Russian agents you think may have had access to those documents over the last decade? How much do we not know about? What was taken that will never be accounted for?,1
"We're all human and we all make mistakes. There's no need for any resignations over a mistake. In tRump's case, we're dealing with obstruction.

There would not be any charges pending against tRump if he had simply complied with the request from the national archives but he resisted and obstructed for well over a year. That is the difference between the two cases.",1
You can‚Äôt imagine the rage I felt when Trump took those docs. Biden went on TV and was indignant about how Trump couldn‚Äôt know he possessed them. I agreed with Biden. Still do. He‚Äôs humiliating.,1
"I‚Äôm not doing to doubt you because obviously we‚Äôve seen people with clearances make negligent mistakes. (Biden) But people with clearances usually don‚Äôt advertise they have/had one and if they do for a specific relevant reason, they only mention the highest one. 

With that, you should know how serious mishandling classified material is and through training should know that ignorance or neglect is not a defense.",1
Cool story bro.  Doesn't apply to Bidumb.,1
"The most important thing is that we don‚Äôt have a two tier justice system. Biden set a good example by reporting to the DOJ (despite hiding it until long after the midterms, which may be another issue‚Ä¶) but he can continue to set the better example by resigning. Only Trump would have held out and never resigned over something like this if he was still in office.",1
We don‚Äôt know the number but CNN last said ‚Äúsome top secret‚Äù in a comparison chart.,1
Go away Antifa,1
"Right and I‚Äôm not saying charge Biden with obstruction or conspiracy. But he should be charged with mishandling classified documents and negligence. These were top secret documents and with Biden having over 50 years of experience‚Ä¶

Yeah he‚Äôs no President Barack Hussein Obama.  That‚Äôs for sure.  I really love how much he pisses off nutters just by talking.  That makes me happy.,1
"You asked if I knew how classification works.

I told you I did and why.",1
Prove it.,1
I don‚Äôt think Biden will resign over this considering he didn‚Äôt realize he still had them and the archives weren‚Äôt actually searching for them. So both parties didn‚Äôt realize they were missing,1
"Ok, thanks I‚Äôll check it out.",1
"I rest my case.

Dismissed.",1
How do you know they were too secret?,1
"How do you know President Joe Biden mishandled them?  What if it was an envoy or a representative for President Barrack Hussein Obama who shared and stored the intelligence for important, remote meetings and never retrieved them.  It could be anything.  The independent counsel will sort it out.",1
Fair. I probably should have asked if you cared about how classification works when it applies to your preferred political candidate instead.,1
"That‚Äôs a safeguarding problem then. Still a crime. These are documents related to national security, you can‚Äôt just ‚Äúoops‚Äù it. There are logs regarding these things. There needs to be a significant look into safeguarding procedures and if a President can‚Äôt safeguard top secret documents then he may not be fit for the job. I think that‚Äôs fair and I‚Äôd argue that Trump should be held to the same standard.",1
There‚Äôs a few articles that have said ‚Äúsome top secret‚Äù. CNN was last article I saw mentioning it.,1
"That's a loaded question that I will not answer.

I have no idea what Biden was privy to, nor is it my business.",1
"I definitely feel like trump should be held to the same standard, if seen that through Biden‚Äôs negligence nothing happened then I doubt anything happens but need some actual investigations into trump too",1
"I think we‚Äôre on the same page for this. DOJ needs to raid all Biden residences immediately as well as a resignation from Biden. Then DOJ can conduct investigations on Trump and Biden. Hell, they can even share a cell at the end. But we definitely need equal application of the law. I remember Democrats saying that someone who can‚Äôt handle classified documents is not fit for office and I think I agree.",1
Biden's resignation would make Kamala Harris president.  I doubt that's really what many conservatives actually want happening.,1
"She should resign with him, it‚Äôs the only honorable thing to do. I‚Äôm not particularly happy about McCarthy being next in line either. But it seems to dangerous to leave things as they are.",1
"What exactly makes her resignation justified or honorable?  

She is not complicit in anything Biden did as VP.  There's literally nothing to dishonor her reputation in the least bit and she would definitely see accepting the role as president as the honorable thing to do in the highly unlikely event that Biden were to resign.  

Honestly, no matter how hard they try, the house probably won't even get enough votes for an impeachment over this.

What ""danger"" do you envision if things are left as they are?",1
I‚Äôm gonna take a shortcut. Transpose everything democrats said about Trump‚Äôs classified documents and apply that. Save us all the mental gymnastics.,1
"Nope. You're making a strawman argument. The two situations are completely different. 

Trump lied and attempted to hide the documents, would not return them when requested and many documents are missing.  

Biden discovered he had documents that he forgot about and immediately did the right thing by disclosing and turning them in with full cooperation.  

Biden's actions are a perfect example of what the right and honorable thing to do in the situation and Trump's actions are a perfect example of what the wrong and dishonorable thing to do in the situation.

Also... so far what charges have been brought against Trump for his theft of classified documents? Why hasn't he faced any consequences yet?  

It's not about what people from one political persuasions opinions say about it that matters, it's the actual real world consequences brought down by the justice department that matters and also sets the precedent.  So far, there's nothing but crickets.",1
"You‚Äôre talking about obstruction. I‚Äôm talking about mishandling of classified material which is the more dangerous crime. Yes Trump may have lied, but Biden potentially hid it for years and the walls were closing in. 

If they both share a cell, then fine. But mishandling classified material is extremely serious and Biden is guilty.",1
"Really?  Trump kept his stolen documents in a pool house shed at Mar-A-Lago.  You really gonna say that that's not mishandling?

Furthermore... Obstruction often comes along with a string of other offences since it's behavior that guilty people engage in to attempt to cover up their crimes.",1
"I‚Äôm not defending trump at all, that was also mishandling. Heck, Trump and Biden can both share a cell. 

I agree with Nancy Pelosi when she said that anyone mishandling classified documents like that is unfit for public service.",1
"The problem is the paucity of local investigative journalism. With so much local news having been killed by the internet, it‚Äôs very hard to find out anything about local politicians. We have fantastic information on governors, senators and Presidents, but anything below that generally slips under the radar.

I live in his district and his opponent Zimmerman claimed that he had some of this information and went to the papers, but papers were covering other more exciting candidates locally and nationally.  Since Zimmerman had a very slim budget and little support from the Nassau Democratic Committee.  

But honestly Santos' district and most of Long Island NY has gone full MAGA.  I own 2 family house with my brother and I am trying to convince him to sell and move back to NYC.  The problem is while he is not full MAGA he doesn't mind them and is a Republican himself.",1
"There are many people, maybe not the ones with an overriding concern, that knew Santos was a liar. The problem is not with Democrats' failure to investigate whether he was a typical republican, but rather with the broad cynicism which seems to be spreading across America, in no small part encouraged by conservative losers. Thankfully, the state GOP organization has recognized how Santos has embarrassed them, and so has called for his resignation. But it is unlikely that national GOP will have such concerns over yet another con man in their camp.",1
Santos is walking proof that republicans are the most gullible and useful idiots in the world.,1
"I also have a bone deep contempt for Republicans, but they are adults with moral agency. They knew what Santos was and they liked it.

Daddy doesn‚Äôt drink because Mommy burned the casserole or you got a C in algebra. He drinks because he loves booze.",1
Why tf should Democrats have ANY blame in this? Republicans need to investigate their own candidates and are responsible for their own.,1
"I can't fault Republicans for voting for him when they didn't know about his lies. But at the same time they knew all about Trump but voted for him anyway, so it's not like their ignorance about Santos means that they wouldn't knowingly vote for a liar.",1

"Even if the Democrats went all out in investigating the guy and trying to tell the voters not to vote for him, if the voters wanted him, they still would have voted him into office.

"Excellent question. His opponent‚Äôs campaign people are clearly utterly incompetent. Guaranteed that several people‚Äòs sole job was to dig up dirt on Santos. Easiest job in the world it turns out.

On the other hand, Santos is more than a mere liar. Dude seriously sounds like a sociopath. No way that didn‚Äôt manifest itself during his campaign, which puts into question his entire staff as well. 

I‚Äôm starting to wonder whether he was such a complete sociopath that people were frightened of him, including his staff and his opponents. Because WTF?",1
"This guy ran in 2020 as well, this is basic oppo research that the democrats failed to do.",1
It can be both.,1
Does DJT ring a bell?,1
"Any information turned up solely by Democrats would just be disregarded by too many voters in the district. This level of scrutiny needs to be done by local journalists but they have largely been denuded of resources. The fact that Santos could 'get away' with this much lying and still be elected is a sign of how information ebbs and flows in the modern world.  
...and now that we know that Santos used deception to summon the 'consent of the governed', what does the House intend to do about it?",1
"Our newspaper was bought out by media giant Gannett before the internet had it's big impact. That might not have been it's death, but it was the beginning of the end. The internet was the coup de gr√¢ce.",1

I think they knew he was a shit but not that he lied about his entire life.,1

Most voters had no idea about his extensive lies because how could they have possibly known when nobody was talking about it? Even the local Republicans didn't know how extensive his lies were because now they're calling for him to resign.",1
"Have you ever heard of the Republicans being responsible for a bad Democrat? Absolutely not, a bad Democrat would be 100% the responsibility of the Democrats, so why would you blame Santos on the Dems?",1
"NPR discussed this the other day. They said it's party laziness.  Both parties are expected to find dirt on the oppositions candidate, so they don't bother investigating their own.  In this case, the Democrats thought it was enough to point out that Santos was anti abortion and pro Trump so they stopped looking.",1
Because it shows we don't do a good enough job informing voters about the alternative and contrasting it with our candidates.  We have a LOT to learn from this.,1
">I can't fault Republicans for voting for him when they didn't know about his lies.

Can you fault them for voting for a guy they knew nothing about? That they elected him makes them kind of responsible for him. The fucking republican voters in his district own this embarrassment.",1
"This only matters if they care about whether what they believe or tell others is true or not. Given that they voted for Trump knowing that he is dishonest demonstrates that for them, they see it as a feature i.e. something that can be used to ‚Äúown the libs‚Äù. They only care when it becomes something that either a) their one true sin, losing or b) they feel deceived in a manner that is important to them directly.",1
"Even if they did know, it would not change their view nor their vote.",1
Of course they don‚Äôt care. That‚Äôs why it was absurd seeing the Nassau Country Republicans demanding Santos resign this afternoon.,1
Agreed. Basic opposition research should have uncovered the lies.,1
Riiiight. The Democrats should have exploited his lying but they cannot be the ones to present that data without being discarded as partisan hack jobs by too many. These facts need to be discovered by local journalists and then elevated to voters.,1
I‚Äôm really curious to know what lies they knew about. What was acceptable to them before he was exposed and became an embarrassment?,1
"Yeah, if Santos was a Democrat no-one would be asking ‚Äúdid the Republicans do zero research?‚Äù They‚Äôd again ask ‚ÄúDid Democrats do zero research?‚Äù",1
That only works for undecided voters. A republican will vote for anybody with an R by their name on the ballot.,1
"What do you mean they knew nothing about him?  He had been interviewed, written about, spent months bragging about himself.  This guy probably only won in a competitive district because people listened to all his bullshit about being a gay, Jewish, animal lover philanthropist, Wall Street investment banker.  He literally lied so that just about every fucking idiot that is caught up in identity politics would find him appealing. 

If the Democrats or the media were even partly competent, this would not have happened.  There is reporting that the Republican Party knew he was lying before the election, but let it slide because he was already the only candidate they had.  

You want to blame someone, blame one of the institutions that we rely on for a healthy democracy which has failed us.",1

Being afraid of change will not stop it from happening.

Change is needed so that the billionaires like one term twice impeached former President Trump and his cronies pay taxes.

Do you think it's OK for him to pay ""$ 0"" in taxes?

I don't.

That needs to change.

The IRS was short staffed and they did not have enough people assigned / going over his taxes? What?

Even though it is mandated by the IRS that all presidential taxes be audited and made available. As a matter of fact? You could go online today and find tax returns of former presidents.

Just Google it.

In actuality? I can't wait for the IRS Commissioner (that did the dirty work) for one term twice impeached former President Trump to come before Congress. 

Oh? Least we forget? 

That might not happen because the Republicans are doing away with so many processes in place to stop autocratic progression in America.

And? They are trying to protect their fearless leader, as usual.

There's always hope. I have high hopes.",1

This bill is meant to keep audits from happening in regards to their rich friends.

That's a lot of money for Republicans who __*claim* they want to save Americans money.__

Republicans tried fear mongering to try to send fear into the homes of Americans, even to the point of claiming that all of the new hires would be armed. And that they would go after lower and middle class Americans.

It's __one of their infamous tactics.__

>*Republicans claimed throughout the midterm campaign that Democrats were sending ""an army of IRS agents"" to go after middle- and lower-class taxpayers with the new agency funding in the IRA, which passed along party lines last year. Some Republicans even went so far as to suggest that the IRS agents would be armed.*

The manipulative fearmongering of the grifter known as one term twice impeached former President Trump, and his minions are something Americans don't want.

They __made it clear__ in the last election.

In actuality? 87,000 employees of the IRS are slated to be hired. Not all of them have the ability to audit, nor will all of them be agents. 

Many employees of the IRS are slated to leave due to retirement, changing jobs, etc. The new personnel and other changes will take place __over a 10-year span.__

Republicans __do not want__ IRS employees to be hired. Nor do they want the IRS, its facilities, and IT systems to be updated - something they have desperately needed for a long time. 

The Republicans make it seem like the employees __would be hired today,__ which is not true. The changes take place over the *span of a decade.*

They have continuously fought funding to provide personnel, facility, and technological upgrades to the IRS to __protect their friends, lobbyists, and corporate supporters.__

>*The IRS has said it plans over the next decade to use the roughly $80 billion from the IRA to update its antiquated technology systems, after years of under-funding by Congress, and hire and train new information technology specialists and customer service representatives as well as new agents, only a small fraction of whom -- in the Criminal Investigation division -- are armed.* 

Some of those people will have jobs to assist with auditing people like one term twice impeached former President Trump and his cronies. 

It's __very much needed.__

Obviously? 

Any *billionaire* __who pays 0 in taxes?__ Or even $750 during another year? And has many friends and cronies who do the __exact same thing?__

Needs to be audited.

And their red headed leader is not the only one.

While __my family and others__ pay so much more? 

Period.

We need the money. And they need to pay their share.

That is all we are asking for. 

We __want them to pay their fair share.__

What is wrong with that?

They were laughing all the time.",1
I have been hoping this is the birth of a third party.  The ultra right wing to split the GOP and force them both into powerlessness.,1

We always knew exactly what they were.,1
My biggest wish is for the Repubiclan Party to self-destruct and no longer exist.,1
"We‚Äôre going to find out really quick. If they get these shitty fucking rules passed tonight, we‚Äôre in for a LOOOONG 2 years. If a few republicans somehow grow a spine, we might be okay.

Edit: looks like they decided to wait until Monday for the rules vote.",1
If the Republican really wants to fix it‚Äôs self all the normal Republicans should join Democrats until the nuts are gone,1
Have they announced the Biden Impeachment yet?,1
When Trump runs as 3rd party that‚Äôs when this shit show really ramps up.  I can‚Äôt wait.,1
May it purify and fade into the flora,1
The proof lies in the foxnews.com comment section. Go check it out. I guarantee you will find it full of nothing but hatred and bigotry.,1
"Clearly...No respect at all for the fundamental principles of democracy. As long as they can keep the flow of dollars out of the Treasury and into their donors accounts, they think ""Job Well Done!"" $30 trillion over the last 41 years.

Well at least they can now refill the bag with not shit unlike the democrats who are just another bag of shit just intact,1
No lies detected,1
I do think it‚Äôs happening.,1
I've been hoping for this since Trump and DeSantis started to distance themselves from each other.,1
"If Trump runs as a third party, that's when it'll happen.",1
It's kind of informally occurred,1
In a first past the post winner take all system it cant happen. There can be a transition period where a new party forms and if they win the members of the old party will then migrate over to the new party as what happened with the republican party 150ish years ago. The best we can hope for is a new right leaning party forms that wants to govern and isnt filled with crazies but regular ppl who are sick of the republican bs and they gain more support than the republican party so they fight it out for a few election cycles where the republican party keeps losing and then the moderate conservative party wins out and becomes the second party that runs against the democrats. If we want a multi party system we need to change the system to be a parliamentary republic.,1
You don't think it's damaging to not have a single functional right wing party in this country?,1
"As long as the Perot the Rs, that‚Äôs cool.",1
"Alas, that's not an appropriate response anymore. Now all we can do is just hope for the best in 2024.",1

What's that mean?,1
They have said that from day one.,1
The Dems could run anyone and win. I‚Äôm hoping for a Pete/Porter ticket.,1
"God, I hope. That‚Äôs the only shot of Democrats holding the Senate and would guarantee a Democrat wins the Presidency.

I doubt Trump will though. As spiteful as he is, even he knows he‚Äôd do terribly just due to being a third party candidate. He wont want to suffer that embarrassment.",1

"If the debt ceiling isn't raised, the US will default on its national debt, causing an economic crisis.  Only Congress can raise the debt ceiling.",1
Google debt ceiling,1
Pete for sure,1
Perfect!,1
None of that has anything to do with fascism. Republican party does not want to install a dictator so that we don't have democracy any more.,1
I want you to be right. But it's always going to be an IF until it happens.,1
"The government of a nation can't move at 1000mph while half of its citizens are moving at 20, without a catastrophic split and collapse.",1
So you don't care if we have anything anchoring us to our traditions and history? There has to be a counterweight to the left.,1
Perfect,1
Is there anything we can do to stay beneath the ceiling?,1
"Wouldn't a default mean we set back to 0 having no national debt? And just screw countries we owe? I doubt they have been accouting with the debt we owe them in place. 

I think it is more of a we aren't paying anyone back statement.",1
I loved Pete's first run but I don't think he can win a national general election like President. That's just my perspective/feeling. His communication skills are through the roof though!,1
Right. They just want to run America dictatorially.,1
When they let our government default on our debt your 401k will be worthless. You tried though.,1
What the double fuck?,1
Lmao how the fuck do you know,1
"Tradition is peer pressure from dead people, so only something stupid people care about.  The only thing that is important is reality, not political views.  The left uses scientifically reviewed and tested plans and goals that make society better for everyone.  The right is always trying to make sure the rich stay rich and the poor stay poor.",1
"I think you make a good point about counterweight. I used to think of it like riding a bike, you have to pedal on both sides to make it balance and go forward. The balance was to keep extremists from both parties from having too much power. But look what has happened. The extremists on the right have taken over the House. They do not care about governing, about making things better for We the People; they only care about power. In essence, they want straight white ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù men to rule and anyone else should be here only to *serve THEM*. That is true and it has always been true. That is why they are so cruel about not wanting to help the military after they have served, or the middle class and poor, the marginalized, the peons. 
This country is in so much trouble. But then so is the Republican Party. We will see how it plays out. 
BTW I care about traditions and history. We are just knocked off our bikes right now.",1
"In the short term no, it allows the treasury to pay for things that have already been signed into law.",1
No one outside the US would want to lend to the US after that. Everyone would want the country to pay upfront for everything.,1
"Unrelated, this guy can‚Äôt get a credit card anymore.",1
Lol no.,1
What's the benefit of what? Raising the debt ceiling?,1
His comms is why I think he'll win,1
"A vague generalistic description of Republican party. For the most part Republicans want to lessen government, other than in certain key instances, and lessen taxes. The fact they have a sizable minority of crazy people in the party doesn't make the fascist.

Oh and it's like how one can be a white supremacists and still not a fascist. Specific words require sufficient things for something to equal them.",1
Science is nothing without tradition and values. Science can't hold a country together.,1
I agree with a lot of what you said. I'm just invested in trying to fix the Republican Party. People will start listening when they realize the current ideology is causing them to lose repeatedly.,1
We'll see.,1
You're right. They do want to lessen government in a manner of speaking.,1
No you were not.,1
"The only thing right wingers value is power and money, so yeah no thanks bro",1
"What traditions and values do the right hold, that the left doesn't, that you so strongly want to continue?

I can literally see no tradition or value that is held only by the right that I want the country to continue holding on to.",1
It would not benefit the nation. It would absolutely wreck the economy.,1
"And they‚Äôll blame the subsequent economic crash on the Democrats, specifically President Biden.",1
"They think it will reign in spending or so they claim. It happens all the time, because it's easy fodder for the minority party. They accuse the majority party of wreckless spending, in an attempt to get the majority party to agree to their demands.

Truth is that they should just do away with the limit, especially given how much time is wasted each time it's raised. Normally I wouldn't think much of it, but the GOP is so radical now that they might go too far this time.",1
"They wouldn't. In past years some have *threatened* to, in order to get concessions from the other side.  The debt ceiling was originally created to help fund World War 1.  It made it easier to borrow for the war.  It was never meant to be used as it is today.",1
"Maybe this helps.

https://www.crfb.org/papers/qa-everything-you-should-know-about-debt-ceiling",1
"They know it would be catastrophic, so they try to cram as many additional items into the debt ceiling bill as possible and hold the country hostage until senate and president agree to their demands.",1
"Perhaps Biden might end up working out deals with more moderate Republicans in the house..
(""Sigh"" Wishful thinking!)",1
Strategy would necessitate some form of a legislative agenda,1
The extremist Republicans are now in power. I doubt they will agree to anything in the way of compromises with the Democrats.,1
"However, control is very narrow. On top of that Democrats still have the Senate.",1
"Yes - I think we can expect a lot of their obstructive tactics, political investigations and impeachments of Biden. They will definitely shutdown the goverment and hold that hostage to try to get extremist concessions from the Democrats.",1
"We don‚Äôt know what the concessions were, but we‚Äôll be paying for them.",1
I would deny committee assignments to every one of those members who voted present in the final vote.,1
"A ""concession"" would probably be for him to tell the MAGAts that T****  is never wrong and that he would swear absolute loyalty to T**** no matter what.",1
"If you thought McCarthy‚Äôs election was frustrating, please note: The concessions have reduced the Speaker‚Äôs legislative negotiating style to ‚Äúlet me check with Matt on that and I‚Äôll get back to you.‚Äù",1
"Regardless the MAGAs ain't goin get shit! 

The GOP control of the house is rather narrow plus Democrats still have the Senate and Presidency.",1
"Concessions as in:committee assignments. Also, the ability for it to take less members to start ""movement/resolution"" (I can't remember the word rn) to remove the speaker. Other concessions I haven't heard about but specifics I'm not sure.",1
"McCarthy wanted his name to go in the history books. No telling what his concessions are! Remember he is a Trump boy. He has sold his soul. But who knows, he really may do what‚Äôs equal and right for all Americans‚Ä¶.right or left! Do you believe?",1
"We'll find out about those concessions on Monday, when they try to get it together and vote on the House Rules.

And then we'll see more when the committee assignments are handed out.",1
"MTG's gonna be subpoena'ing anyone she feels like dragging into the house and interrogating.  And since only one side cares about following laws, Democrats are actually gonna drop everything, show up, and let her Benghazi for days on end.",1

Even a functioning party has a hard time reigning in their dirtbags but that‚Äôs what you do when razor thin majorities are present. You make friends across the aisle and toss out partisan nonsense otherwise you‚Äôll get nothing done.",1
"The only reason he won was because of those that voted present, because it lowered the number of votes he needed. Would be crazy to then punish them for it.",1
And then is there a recall vote that the whole house votes on? Or just the majority party?,1
I think he already did that.,1

Bad news is that this stupid mope won with almost no campaigning, so a competent Republican could probably replace him.

He hasn't even had the opportunity to screw over constituents like these other politicians who have been in power for decades.

That leaves the Democrats and the non-aligned to call a halt to their nonsense by voting DOWN every GOP candidate so that we can 'right size' their voice in the decision we make going forward. Despite the gerrymandering, there should be no such thing as a 'safe district'.",1
"I don't know, except that the house has rules and they seem like they are following the rules(no reporting to the contradiction that I've seen anyway).

Tangentially, we should take care not to dismiss the probability that paralyzing the government may be the plan. It's a pretty standard play for the GOP:

1. Fuck something up
2. Wait for it to crash

A potential strategic move for the Democrats in the current situation would be to offer up a genuine moderate Republican as speaker. For example, Fred Upton or Jaime Herrera Beutler, both of who voted to impeach Trump. Chances are that no Republican will even choose to switch for a sane Republican, but if five or more did that would mean they and the Democrats would organize the House. Committees, chairmanships, etc. And it would make MAGAs very, very unhappy. Even with all the necessary compromises on spending to make this happen it would make the next two years not nearly so bad.

""One of Roosevelt's central beliefs was that the government had the right to regulate big business to protect the welfare of society. However, this idea was relatively untested. Although Congress had passed the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890, former Presidents had only used it sparingly. So when the Department of Justice filed suit in early 1902 against the Northern Securities Company, it sent shockwaves through the business community. The suit alarmed the business community, which had hoped that Roosevelt would follow precedent and maintain a ""hands-off"" approach to the market economy. At issue was the claim that the Northern Securities Company‚Äîa giant railroad combination created by a syndicate of wealthy industrialists and financiers led by J. P. Morgan‚Äîviolated the Sherman Antitrust Act because it was a monopoly. In 1904, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of the government and ordered the company dismantled. The high court's action was a major victory for the administration and put the business community on notice that although this was a Republican administration, it would not give business free rein to operate without regard for the public welfare.""

They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.""

"Prior to Trump, I recall republicans having an air of superiority rather than this modern bullying behavior. On topics like abortion and gay marriage they‚Äôd have this smug attitude that they knew they were in the right because they had a hotline to the jeebus. Another big difference was that republicans were all a bunch of sticks in the mud- they were against drinking, pot, casual sex, and anything fun. I recently heard Joe Rogan saying he was a conservative because he likes to ‚Äúdrink beer and watch sports‚Äù‚Ä¶ huh? As GenX I grew up with Reagan inspired conservatives that seemed to make ‚Äúboring‚Äù their defining characteristic. The xenophobia and the prosperity theology were always a part of it. But they were conservative as the name implies- they believed men were to wear suits & ties and women should be in dresses past the knees. Never in a million years would I have thought those republicans would support a pussy grabbing, grifter, narcissist.
I think a lot of MAGA republicans previously had no interest in politics. Trump came along and gave them permission to be bigots and assholes and it was the rallying cry they were waiting for. This, of course, works well for the rich GOP members who have always manipulated the narrative so that their real politics (keeping the rich rich) wasn‚Äôt discussed. My father was 67 when Trump ran for president and he never once talked about politics before that. Now he‚Äôs a full fledged MAGA idiot. For as much as he says he‚Äôs into politics He couldn‚Äôt tell you a fucking thing about actual policy or how the government works.",1

Been told things like, ""you just an idiot"" even if I show exact data that contradicts what they say because it is easier than accepting they may be wrong. It is DEFINITELY an individual problem from people on both sides. Not to say that applies to anyone here of course, just that it isn't a ""right vs left"" issue.",1
It‚Äôs actually funny to me as a republican because this is the exact same thing we think about y‚Äôall,1

"Meh, it's happened to me too.  I've been told I would be put up against the wall after the revolution because I'm a progressive instead of a communist.

But it's *rare* and an edge case.  There are idiots everywhere.  But on the Right it's become part of their identity to behave that way.  While there's that idiot I mentioned previously, I have had plenty of positive discussions with communists counter to that.

I've rarely ever had a political discussion with a conservative go well.",1
The problem with progressivism is that the goal posts keep getting moved and some fringe ideology has become mainstream within the party. We‚Äôve also witnessed that women‚Äôs rights are under attack. Some woke ideas are excellent but a fair amount are hypocritical and cringey.,1

Again, there are 70 million people in the US that believe democrats flat out deny reality as well so can we not even entertain the idea that may be we are wrong in some instances? Would it not seem extremely na√Øve to think there is no way there is any instance in which a republican is right on an issue and a democrat wrong? If we cannot do that then we are a cult not a political party in my humble opinion.  


But let's take examples, and again I am not a republican even remotely but I do know a few instances in which democrats denied reality not anecdotally. Unless you mean anecdotal examples don't happen either in which I could go on and on haha.   


None anecdotal examples first, Biden recently called for a dead person during his speech, the white house's response was that he did not do that and he just missed this person in question. Democrats argued the same thing for days even though we all saw him do it plainly, that is denying reality right there in a funny sense, but I will be more serious.  


Democrats will also argue that abortion is all about the religious side of things and it is not killing anyone. Over 95% of biologist agree that abortion is killing a human life. Now that does not mean abortion is wrong, nor does it mean pro-life is correct, but democrats that argue ""this is not killing anyone"" is completely wrong based on the unfaltering, clear cut science that it is ending a human life. But we could still say that human isn't a person, doesn't have rights, the mother's rights trump it, whatever. But democrats openly argue the opposite at the highest level despite being entirely wrong in the science. This is again openly denying reality in order to push a political position.  


For more anecdotal evidence that may prove a larger point. I AM NOT SUPPORTING THE ELECTION FRAUD ARGUMENT AT ALL FIRST AND FOREMOST. During the 2020 election my vote was lost. What I mean is in my state you can actually track your vote. It was submitted that night and the following morning was missing. This happened to 8 of my family members across 2 states. We all called and were essentially told over and over again that ""we never voted in the 2020 election as there is no ballot"". I can promise you as someone how has voted before there was no error. It was filled out and submitted and in the case of error they would actually still have my ballot. So for 7 of us our ballot was never found and our vote not counted, one of us continued pushing for a week by calling everywhere they could, at the end of the week they found the ballot and submitted it. This did happen to me. I believe it was not malicious, I believe it was poor organization by my state and true human error, however I can understand why some republicans think this is some great fraud because they lost. On the other hand I have been told that is just an entirely made up story by democrats who refuse to accept the reality that something like this can happen. But the reality is my vote was lost in the 2020 election and if it was counted I was never confirmed that it did so I just have to wonder if my vote mattered. Now the majority of the elected officials I voted for in my state were elected anyway so I never worried tooooo much about my vote haha.",1

Would it not seem extremely na√Øve to think there is no way there is any instance in which a republican is right on an issue and a democrat wrong? 

And if we‚Äôve done that and come to the conclusion that no, they‚Äôre still wrong in that belief?

I don‚Äôt think the contents of a speech matter nearly as much as the contents of a law, which is when Republicans deny reality.

The answer to the question is that if a company can not pay their employees a living wage then maybe that company shouldn't exist.,1
Seeing as many companies are making record profits right now it would just be as simple as maybe paying workers more,1
"They can pay more by cutting back on their own salaries. CEO can cut back on their, using my company CEO salary as an example, 13 mil salary and disperse that to the working force. If a company is able to work fully remote, that should save them money too. If they have buildings, they can lease them out to companies creating more income for them. I‚Äôm sure there are numerous ways to pay employees more. But it starts at a cut from the top, I assume, and most CEO don‚Äôt want to cut their 13 mil salary (insane how much money that is for one family every year). 

As far as ‚Äúrecord profits‚Äù. We would need to look at the earnings sheets and view it in percentages. If you look at it for dollar, it will look like these companies are making ‚Äúrecord profits‚Äù because of inflation. But when we look at the percentages, the profits average to about the same if not a little more. 

Now for a living wage, this is not black and white. No one can define a living wage except by using broad and indirect language. Since a living wage is subjective, it can‚Äôt be nailed. A lot of people don‚Äôt make the greatest decision with their money, tons more are indeed underpaid. I believe the issue for that roots at the cost of living (COL), starting at these apartment complexes. There is no reason why a 800 sqft apartment with no washer and dryer should be $2000 a month. I believe it‚Äôs fueled by greed, but I don‚Äôt have knowledge in that industry so I could be completely wrong. 

There is a TON of work to be done and that can be done to help others out with COL. We just have to identify the root problem and work together to find solutions.",1

"I'm sure that some of them will try, but this stuff is really unpopular even in deep red states (look at Kansas for an example of what happens when this is on the ballot). Arizona is already trending bluer every cycle, and if the GOP pushes harder then this simply becomes a wedge issue against them instead of a reliable source of fundraising when Roe was still in place.",1

"Not a psychologist but I‚Äôm pretty sure for a lot of them, they‚Äôre constantly thinking about committing crimes so they assume everyone else is too",1
"IANAP, but in my theory of choice the blatant hypocrisy is just a form of projecting their insecure and narcissistic superiority complex. They think they (and people they like) deserve to be exceptions to their own rules. It's authoritarian. The blatancy just lets them rub outsiders' faces in it and revel in the anger of their 'enemies'. Like a child who's knowingly and flauntingly acting out just to annoy, deriving glee from the other's confusion and frustration.",1
"They just want to shift the blame to others for their crimes, that‚Äôs it",1
"Not a psychologist but I imagine that these whack jobs *actually* think they are doing good by ‚Äúcheating‚Äù and committing voter fraud to get their guy in. Like to them, it‚Äôs something they must do to ‚Äúsave the country‚Äù, not committing a crime. To them they think what they are doing is this sort of rebellion for the greater good.

Not sure how they apply that to their idols being arrested for actual grooming as opposed to LGBTQ people not grooming at all but, clearly these people ain‚Äôt right in the head. Lots of denial, projection, misinformation, narcissism‚Ä¶",1

Remember his debate with Hilary when she called him out back in 2016?? He replied saying he is using the loopholes that are legal and put in place by the politicians, he then told her to close the loopholes but followed up saying he knows she won‚Äôt because she too uses those same loopholes but more importantly her huge donor billionaires enjoy those same loopholes so she‚Äôd need to screw them over. And that‚Äôs why she won‚Äôt and that‚Äôs why No Politician will close them. And again, it‚Äôs not illegal, we just don‚Äôt use the system as we can‚Äôt afford the lawyers and finance people to make it worth it in the end.

It‚Äôs similar to how Elizabeth Warren pointed out how many rich get around the taxes by taking low salaries and get compensated in stock, but if you don‚Äôt cash out then you don‚Äôt pay capital gains, so they take out HUGE loans and use stock as collateral and in the end pay almost no tax in the end plus all the huge write offs.",1

"The most effective pricing strategy for maximizing profit is not always increasing price. A company can increase revenue by way of decreasing price if the quantity of units transacted increases by a sufficiently large amount. Without even adopting this viewpoint, it‚Äôs not particularly hard to see this line of argumentation. In addition to this, it‚Äôs worth noting that policymakers have taken actions such as mobilizing the strategic petroleum reserves, and working with other nations to expand available oil supply, in addition to the fact that this time of year typically is characterized by lower demand for gasoline. Ultimately; the market for gasoline is HIGHLY oligopolistic, and behaves exactly like an oligopoly market would be predicted to behave facing these supply and demand shocks.",1

"I was listening to NPR, and they gave an example of how much gasoline costs vs. the price of crude and found we were paying the correct price. The greed goes all the way up to the source. Apparently, you can order some oil, and the tanker can be rerouted during its delivery because they found someone who is willing to pay more than you. Apparently, the sale isn't final until it's actually delivered.

I don't know how many industries operate like that, but oil is so important that buyers have no choice but to buy oil for one price and potentially pay more to ensure it's actually delivered.",1
"Corporate greed means oil companies have always charged as much as they can to maximize profits, but they have been doing this since their inception‚Äî decades ago. They didn‚Äôt just get greedy, they have always been maximizing profits. The price goes up for a number of other reasons.",1
"I've been screaming this from the hills.  Corporate greed is always present and thus isn't an adequate explanation.

But supply and demand are.  

When Americans drove less, the price of gas collapsed.  When we drive more and there was a supply shock, the price skyrocketed.

We are the cause of high gas prices.  We drive too much and in too big vehicles at too high speeds.  Want lower gas prices?  Use less gasoline.  This means accelerating slower, slower top speed, and coasting to red lights rather than jamming on your brakes.  These are remarkably simple and liveable solutions.",1
I find it interesting that the gas prices went down once the US election was over.,1
They didn't. Gas is still 5.00 a gallon.,1
Not just one thing is involved. It is never simple. One factor - Supply/Demand cycle. Anyone can keep on raising their prices as long as people will pay it and either through monopolies or collusion their are not alternatives to the product. If people stop buying or the government steps in then prices will go down until people start buying again.,1
"They are always greedy.  When supplies are limited they act on that greed, if they didn't we would run out of it because the main way to conserve something is to charge more.

These simple slogans are rarely helpful and are often counterproductive.",1
"Demand dropped in large part caise their greed forced people ro cut driving so they have to drop prices to sell more. 
Interest rate hikes ( by design) have slowed the economy further, killing Demand also prices dup in winter cause fewer peole taking road trips

They dont have to gouch when the demand out paces supply, but they do cause they can get away with it. 

Also, opening the strategic reserves  increased supplies. The other factor is that too much greed suddenly  makes high cost low range  evs more palatable",1
Additionally sometimes large companies will sell at a loss to drive other companies out of business.  Prior to 2020 gas prices were low because OPEC increased production to drive fracking/tar sands out of business.  Those methods required at least $80bbl in 2010 dollars to break even.,1
This. Refineries are a billion dollar investment. With states like California saying they‚Äôre going ban the new sale of gas cars/trucks by 2035 you can safety make an assumption that demand for oil will drop and oil companies won‚Äôt get the return they need off new refineries.,1
Oil is a global commodity.,1
Are you joking? I assume so. Gas prices peaked in June and fell through the election.,1

Limits on the number of guns any individual can possess at one time. Repeal NRA-written laws that encourage violence. And so on. At the same time, police need to be demilitarized and have their military surplus taken back. All aspects of gun-nuttery need to be pulled back, including within law enforcement. These changes need to be federal, as the worst gun violence is made possible because guns flow from gun-happy red states to much more reasonable blue states.",1

"Real simple, but it will never happen. Actually follow the constitution and only allow guns or military type weapons in well regulated militias. Short of that go back to what worked previously which is to ban assault weapons or turning any weapon into an assault weapon. Personally I would like to see any automatic weapon with more than 2 shots banned but again that is not going to happen. After that at least have the decency to treat a weapon meant to kill in the same category as a car. You must pass a test and have training to get a license which allows you to carry.",1

All weapons are deadly, that's why they're weapons. What is it to you that makes you say specifically AR15s? Is it the caliber? Or is it the features that are on the gun?

"Removing guns is entirely out of the question at this point. There are more guns in america than people which means the potential for black market gun sales to grow in the event of a ban is astronomical. Yes we are the only country in the world with this problem to the extent we see it, but banning guns would have very little effect because theyre already out there. I completely agree with the idea of field tests and written firearm safety tests to get a license to purchase guns is 100% a good idea, but ultimately i think the main issue is definitely mental health. 

Mental healthcare in America is pathetic and laughable. You see severe depression and suicide rates within the younger generations with those numbers actively growing. If we implement better gun control laws (not a complete ban) and make a significant effort to provide mental healthcare for our citizens then maybe theres a shot at actually reducing the amount of these atrocities that are committed.",1

There's no way the government can confiscate guns that people already own.

Even if another gun was never made or sold, we could never reign that many in.   Even if there was some way we could magically account for and register every single one of those guns, what happens to them when the own dies?  This isn't the answer I wished for but I think this is the truth.  

Of course we need to get better at providing mental health care, and creating a culture where people don't feel marginalized to the point where shooting up a school is an option, but in reality, that's never going to happen to the degree where it creates an entire cultural shift.  I think the only thing everyday, normal people like us can do is to be kind to everyone,  including the weird loners, listen to people when they're hurting, and hope for the best.",1
Give every kid an AR-15. Not any younger than kindergarten however. You cant trust those 4 year olds. /s,1

Edit: And if you‚Äôre thinking of downvoting this comment ask yourself, is this not what they are doing when shooting up a school?",1
"There should be more than ""adequate"" background checking. There should be mental health requirements. There should be longer waiting periods.

The reality is that mental health care is a super low priority in this country. It's just not that fact alone, though. Healthcare in this country is expensive for most. More and more people continue to struggle in this country because of the rising cost of living and the stagnant base pay range. People simply can't afford to live RIGHT.

Living right is living in a place with a livable wage for the WORKING CLASS. A place that provides healthcare instead of giving that money to domestic spying and proxy wars in foreign countries that line the pockets of the elite. A place that PRIORITIZES EDUCATION and uses our tax money as such.  


I could go on, but my point is that the cause of this problem is a hairy beast that we haven't even begun to tackle those issues that we are facing that contribute not just to school shootings, but the lack of care for our working class in general. We are seeing the outcome of a struggling uneducated population being fed disinformation.

"Hold up all military spending until the weapons industry capitulates to lots of gun control.

Then most gun violence is with handguns. 

Of those, most are involving gangs.

If we wanted to reduce gun crime, we would target gangs. But we don‚Äôt do that. We target republicans.",1
"Yes, over 80% of homicides are pistols and are much more of a threat due to their ease of concealment. However, how do you ban handguns and then tell woman they are not allowed to defend themselves anymore as handguns are also the most common self-defense weapon.",1
The back ground checks work. It's the lack of reporting to the system that's fucked up. I definitely don't have the answer but when a kid tells a therapist that he wants to shoot the school up. Or something similar he needs to be blocked from purchasing a weapon.,1
More guns does not equal more safety. This is born out in actual research. Please educate yourself.,1

1. What about self-defense outside of a home? The most common self-defense firearm for women is a handgun. Other guns are too large and revolvers are a bad choice for self-defense for many reasons. How do we justify not allowing women to defend themselves?
2. The point of the 2nd amendment was protection against the government.  No one really argues this isn't important after what we have seen in places like venezula where firearms were taken and then mass genocide took place. It is easy to prove that an armed citizen base can stand up to a government. Large firing tanks/missiles/high collateral damage weapons would never be used against civilians as it defeats the purpose since the government is essentially destroying itself by doing this. In a revolt you see the government use primarily ground based firearm led combat which is very difficult against a large armed civilian population (look at Russia in major Ukrainian cities where soldiers have stated they cannot advance because they don't know who will shoot them). So how do we justify disarming civilians against the government?",1

I don't think guns are a big problem in America when looking at total deaths that being said it is still true America's ""gun problem"" is far worse than other countries.

Also you are being disingenuous by saying targeting Republicans. That is merely a byproduct of targeting guns.

I do wonder what the stats show regarding accidental deaths from improper gun storing as I believe risk goes up dramatically by owning a gun.",1
"I mean do the majority of women even use handguns? Also isn't one more likely to have negative outcomes from owning a gun in general?

Aside from all that bans are impossible and would never work so not sure why anyone talks about them. At best even if passed everything already in circulation would be grandfathered in. Once the original gun ban was appealed there is no hope of reinstating such a thing imo.

I also don't get why there is a huge focus on this topic when there are more or equal deaths or suffering in other topics.",1
In many states anyone can buy a used AR15 with no background check in the street. It‚Äôs called the gun show exemption,1
such as?,1
"""punishing"" 

If you can't hear it, there's eye-rolling in this statement.",1
"1. You can still defend yourself with a revolver, you are making a bad faith argument and you know it.
2. People who think AR-15s will protect them against the government are delusional and live in a fantasy land. It will never happen, there's a reason US police have been militarized over the last 20 years. And that's not even counting the military.",1
In America yes. Assault rifle being #1 for type of weapon,1
"If they cared about stopping shootings, they‚Äôd go after gang bangers. But they target AR15 owners, which are the least likely to be involved in a shooting. 

The risk from owning a gun is from suicide not accidents. Again, adding suicides into the stats is highly misleading.",1
"It's wire to wire in the comment above.


There's a whole class of weapons that aren't deadly. The definition of an assault weapon is easily accessible and not hard to understand. Immediately after you claim there is no definition, you begin to complain about one of the definitions. The weapons available during the federal assault weapon ban of 1993 are not analogous to currently available AR platforms.",1
Actually the number one cause of death for people under the age of 18 in United States is car accidents. According to most statistical articles. Firearms and drug overdoses. Are a close second and third.  The definition of an assault rifle is nothing other than a rifle that someone commits assault with. It's not actually a type of weapon. You can take your great great grandfather's musket rifle and shoot somebody with it and it now is by definition a Assault rifle. Not trying to argue but this is why this problem isn't making progress.,1
There is zero chance that the number of child deaths from rifles of any sort is greater than deaths from handguns.  The second half of your statement is blatantly false.,1
">If they cared about stopping shootings, they‚Äôd go after gang bangers.

Not sure where you reach that conclusion as at the top of my head I know that's incorrect and have looked up the stats now to back that up:

""According to the National Gang Center, the government agency responsible for cataloging gang violence, there was an average of fewer than 2,000 gang homicides annually from 2007 to 2012. During roughly the same time period (2007 to 2011), the Federal Bureau of Investigation estimated an average of more than 15,500 homicides annually across the United States, indicating that gang-related homicides were approximately 13% total homicides annually.""

""The Bureau of Justice Statistics finds the number of gang-related homicides to be even lower. In 2008, the government agency identified 960 homicides, accounting for 6% of all homicides that year. ""

Also it's just about emotions. Most undocumented immigrants and those that cross the border are not violent nor criminals (other than breaking law of entering country and working). Plus they economically are a net benefit to USA and for the most part don't take jobs away from average American. Yet Republicans have hysteria over it nonetheless. They also don't target business owners who employ then and instead focus on individuals. Trump's wall would never stop or seriously hinder illegal immigration nor does it impact majority that over stay visas. Each side has an issue they are emotional about and solutions are not reasonable or ineffective.

>The risk from owning a gun is from suicide not accidents. Again, adding suicides into the stats is highly misleading.

That is not entirely accurate. Accidental discharges and kids getting a hold of guns are factors as well. You are also incorrect to say it's misleading due to suicides if we are talking about risk of death from owning a gun.",1
"Questions if you don't mind. When talking about true weapons we are talking about ""firearms"" (this excludes bb and airsoft guns wide and large as only two states actually consider them firearms). So I am in good faith asking what firearms are not deadly that should not be banned? Keep in mind non-lethal firearms used by the police like rubber bullets and beanbags are actually extremely deadly ironically enough haha.

The complaint was about the lack of definition, they just banned several parts that are not even apart of many military grade fully-automatic weapons. So what is the official definition of an assault rifle?  


I also have to strongly disagree that the weapons available during the ban and  now are not extremely similar. I have no clue who tweeted this but it is the only way I can share a viable picture haha. There are several images comparing pre and post ban weapons and as someone who knows a lot about firearms I can tell you that are almost the exact same. In fact I know many people that even before the ban would pick up the post-ban version instead because they don't like collapsible stocks or extended pistol grips. Also remember it was only illegal to sell these attached to the AR, but all ARs are interchangeable.

"In Europe, undocumented immigrants are not eligible for national healthcare systems.",1
"Pretty sure from your question you have little idea of how much, or how little illegal immigration there us in the USA.

However, as a true universal healthcare would be cheaper than the current US healthcare, they should be able to increase the amount of illegal immigration without affecting anything.",1
Considering undocumented people pay into Medicare and social security without ever being able to collect it we're doing just fine. Actually the problem we have is a lack of workers because of our broken immigration system.,1
Just like medicare requires an SSN.  Alaska and Hawaii already have universal healthcare and there isn't a problem.  You have been lied to about how healthcare works and immigration.,1
Would you rather have them use the ER? Healthcare for everyone benefits everyone.,1
Undocumented aliens pay 11 billion dollars on avg a year in taxes while simultaneously not being able to take advantage of social services. If you pay your taxes I see no reason why you shouldn't be able to take advantage of it.,1

Yes. Yes, I can.",1
"When I moved to Canada, I wasn‚Äôt eligible for Ontario health insurance until I was a citizen. I had a short term policy from Blue Cross to bridge the gap.",1
"Is there other states that have that implemented? Because Alaska, having Ca√±ada and being incredibly difficult to traverse through is hard for illegal immigrants to get to. Also hawaii is separated with an ocean. 

Is there other states that are in the lower 48 that could have the same success with universal healthcare (like Alaska and hawaii) but be within areas where illegal immigrants can get to?

For example, Texas, Arizona, California, ect. Would that work for these states close and accessible to the border?",1

It made people wonder why he was working so hard to keep them hidden. The usual guesses were that it showed he wasn't as rich as he claimed, didn't pay much in taxes, maybe cheated on them, or it showed income from a source he wouldn't want to be public.",1
"It has been claimed by many that he had been cheating on his taxes since he first announced his intention to run for the presidency, but his use of the courts to block probes has allowed him to keep claiming it is a baseless accusation. Lately, his attempts at legally suppressing the truth are becoming increasingly feeble and many allegations are proving true. This story in particular is pretty huge news all by itself.

"The far right is having a hard time finding their underdogs to pick on these days. 

Cultural rhetoric picked up and did away with being able to continue being openly bigoted 

80s-African Americans. Civil rights wasn't really over, but mainstreaming AA culture to America through television and the first real generation of post civil rights kids, being bigoted against blacks turned into a very bad thing.

90s- Women- sexism and open misogynism really started to gain attention. Clarence Thomas and sexual exploitation of women in and out of the workplace started to move equal rights for women into the mainstream. Women who had careers were starting to be seen as normal, not mannish. 

00's - Middle East- the beginning of the 00's had open bigotry and hate towards anyone from that region of the world out and in style based on political manipulation of 9/11. It took over a decade of that for people to start learning a little more about the region. Still a easy target though, but these days our culture at least pretends to be more sensitive to Muslims. 

10's- Homosexuals finally got rights to marry and be miserable too. The F word went completely out of usage. Try as they might, the right just couldn't stop the overwhelming support for LGB equality, or at least way more than had been in prior decades. 

Where else do you find a group of people that are easy to pick on, often misunderstood, and not part of a major group of influence in the US? Trans! The Christian fascists can so easily manipulate the public's perception of transgendered and transexual people- and they're a small group, no money, power or influence, and can't fight back. 

It is honestly the most one-sided, pitiful abuse of cultural influence I've ever seen.",1
Why is it always Russian propaganda when it is something left leaning people disagree with?,1
Left leaning people disagree with hating other people for their sexuality. Right leaning people hate anyone who isn‚Äôt right wing. It‚Äôs Russian propaganda because it‚Äôs exactly the view point of Russian propagandists. Literally everything being spewed out of the Trump caucus are the exact same talking points you see on Russian TV. Stop watching Tucker Carlson.,1
See still not true. Right wing people don't just hate people who aren't right wing. They usually just dislike ideas that they disagree with. Even me a gay right leaning person still disagrees with people on the left and right because I don't agree with everything that is said by either side. But sure if you want to live in a world where the US is the good guy and the Democratic party is the saviors of the world go ahead. But you are delusional and should broaden your horizon and learn a little more. Nothing wrong with watching a balance of news outlets from CNN to Fox News at least this way you will know what the other side is thinking.,1

Two lessons...1) Learn and measure all future political candidate choices against the [www.principlesofdemocracy.org](https://www.principlesofdemocracy.org) and 2) Never let your apathy for the choices keep you from voting! There's always a better choice of the two...and without your vote for the better one, the worser choice has a bigger shot. 

HRC's winning and inauguration would probably have only added $2T to the debt rather than Trump's $8.6T, saved 700K Americans from death by COVID - Hillary would not have deconstructed Obama's pandemic framework and listened to the science - USA matching Canada's deaths per million would yield 700K fewer deaths - and certainly there would have been no attempted coup if Hillary lost her bid for re-election.

My opinion is that almost nobody truly loyal to Trump has any governmental power. Everyone near him that's actually got political power are fine with him as long as he is good for them, nothing more, nothing less. I think all his true followers and real admirers are just people on the outside of the systems.",1

>*A group of 40 House Democrats, led by Rep. David Cicilline (R.I.), introduced legislation on Thursday to bar former President Trump from holding future federal office under the 14th Amendment. Section 3 of the amendment states that no one who previously took an oath to support the Constitution and engaged in ‚Äúinsurrection or rebellion‚Äù shall ‚Äúhold any office, civil or military, under the United States.‚Äù*

Wouldn't it be wonderful if they could get this passed before the new Congress is sworn in?  The chances of that happening are pretty slim, but it sure is nice to think about.

>*One point of agreement, including by the¬†judge in Greene‚Äôs case, seems to be that a criminal conviction is not required for an individual to be disqualified by Section 3.*

It's as clear as the nose on anyone's face that one term twice impeached former President Trump tried to destroy America. He is still trying to do so - to this very day.

>*Cicilline said in a release announcing the legislation that Trump ‚Äúvery clearly‚Äù engaged in an insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021, with the intention of overturning the results of the 2020 presidential election. ""You don‚Äôt get to lead a government you tried to destroy,‚Äù he said. The bill also specifically describes how Trump helped encourage the violence on Jan. 6, tried to intimidate state and federal officials when they did not support his false claims of the election being stolen and refused to denounce the mob that stormed the Capitol for hours during the riot. ""The 14th Amendment makes clear that based on his past behavior, Donald Trump is disqualified from ever holding federal office again and, under Section 5, Congress has the power to pass legislation to implement this prohibition,‚Äù Cicilline said.*

Oh by far I agree. We are gonna have to vote blue like hell to keep these bastards out regardless. But I know with Trump's narcissism he will not back down if Desantis wins the nomination and neither one will reach the necessary amount to win the presidency. But here's hoping this will lead to the Republican parties downfall and we can eventually have much better 3rd party candidates.

"One term twice impeached former President Trump has decided (in addition to his just released NFT trading cards) that he will fight the left-wing regime for free speech (paraphrasing here) for everyone.

>*Now that we‚Äôre all done (or not) laughing over¬†Trump‚Äôs collection of NFT trading cards, let‚Äôs turn to a second announcement he made on Thursday: a deeply concerning promise to ‚Äúshatter the left-wing censorship regime and to reclaim the right to free speech for all Americans.‚Äù*

When one term twice impeached former President Trump was in office? That is not the way he acted, nor is it the way he treated people who may have had different philosophies than he had.

It seems to me that his primary goal in life is to plant anger and hatred in the hearts and minds of everyone who hears his voice.

>*‚ÄúIn recent weeks, bombshell reports have confirmed that a sinister group of derp-state bureaucrats, Silicon Valley tyrants, left-wing activists, and depraved corporate news media have been conspiring to manipulate and silence the American people,‚Äù Trump said in the video.*

Is this his plan in order to have another insurrection? Why does that not surprise me?

Pugnacious want-to-be dictator and defeated one term former President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice)__ incited an insurrection, tried to destroy our democracy and our US Constitution. He has made it clear that his intentions to continue with this mindset are still at the top of his mind.

Everyone should think about that - every single day. From now until election day.",1

"""How to privatize education? How could that work?""

It's pretty simple. There are private schools all over the country. Many of them charge lots of money for kids to attend. They can teach (or not) whatever they want, with little government control. Conservatives want to avoid government control which could require them to teach facts like evolution theory and the history of slavery, while prohibiting teaching straight from the bible. Liberals want kids to learn real science and facts. Liberals also want all kids to get a good education at a cost that everyone can afford. Public schools have, in the past, provided access to a quality education paid for by taxes, and available to all.

The right wing wants to end public education so they can teach flat earth and bible. They prefer to discriminate between races and gender and wealth in deciding which kids get a decent education. And they want the rich to profit from running schools, partly to justify elimination of Boards of Education.",1

"The states have no standing to sue the federal government to force it to continue providing funding to the states, no matter how patriotic they are. What it would really boil down to is state Representatives in the House and Senators in the Senate passing budgets to secure the funding, and possibly passing a law requiring the federal government to continue funding state level education. 2 problems with this -
1. States historically have fought hard against national standards for education. If the federal government is going to be bound to provide money for education, you can bet they're going to insist on a national standard curriculum. There's no way this country would ever be able to agree on any of that. 
2. Our Congress can't manage to get much done when it's ONLY in the interest of helping the general public. This is especially true when Congress is split and it requires a majority of both parties to get anything done. 
Oh,  ""...at least 50 states...."", I laughed way too hard at this, thank you!",1
"Private schools are better because they're better funded and exclusive in who they let in. Public schools are funded by tax dollars and essentially get $X per student. Republicans are using ""school vouchers"" to take tax money out of the public school system and let it flow the student.... to private for profit schools. As more affluent (traditionally white) people switch from public to private school, there is less money available for those who remain in public education. So, poor people and people of color who can't get in to private school get a substandard education compared to the private schools - both funded (at least partially) by taxpayer money. If parents want to put their kids in private school, that's fine, but tax dollars shouldn't be taken away from public school systems because of it. 
To be clear, Republics don't want reliving taught in school. They want Christianity taught in schools. Satanic Temple is using the Republican backed ""freedom of religion"" laws to force systems that allow Christian after school clubs to also allow satanic temple school clubs. You can't have freedom of religion and then exclude religions you don't like. Many schools have closed their Christian after school programs rather than allow satanic temple programs to participate. His that for freedom of religion? It's the same way white communities shut down public pools and filled them with dirt rather than integrate and allow black students in.
The is very mainstream Republican, but just the fringe group you describe. 
As for Trump, he get behind whatever issue he thinks will get him the most money and power. As for education, why do you think he made De Vos the Education Secretary? She had no relevant experience and no relevant education. She was a strong proponent of school vouchers and he knew she'd work to dismantle the Education dept.

"I agree with the beef for a national curriculum. Covid exposed the fundamental flaw in mass homeschooling - most parents aren't equipped to teach their kids (even with online assistance from schools) and working parents don't have the ability to work and be home with their kids during the day. 
If public schools were abolished, I would think that small home schools run by a couple of parents each would pop up in neighborhoods. Of course, they won't be free and there's no guarantee of who you're leaving your kids with. Of course, there would still be large for-profit schools that spring up. They would be able to buy existing school buildings for cheap and then staff them with their own teachers/workers. Essentially, it would be the complete privatization of public education, which is exactly what Republicans want to do. Why would they want to do that? 2 reasons. 
1. Get richer. Privatized education will be a huge money maker, just like the current chief system is now. 
2. This families who can't afford to send kids to privatized educating will instead send their kids to a trade school and then the work force. This creates a much larger labor pool, lower wages, and puts more profit in the pockets of the rich.
This is America. If you ever want to figure out why something is happening and who benefits from it - follow the money.",1

Republicans do care about the economy over a lot of things, :/ that's been the case even in 1865, however if they continue with, their Whataboutism and their economic concerns, it's going to fail them..

"It should not surprise anyone that one term twice impeached former President Trump (who is involved in all aspects of the Trump Organization) used his infamous delaying tactics to try to put out the growing embers exploding via the flames encroaching on his organization and life.  

What is surprising is that we are just finding out about it now.

>*The Trump Organization lost a secret criminal contempt trial in October 2021 for ignoring four grand jury subpoenas and three court orders for company documents in a tax-fraud case, The New York Times reported Tuesday. While the penalty was light - a $4,000 fine, the maximum - the conviction illustrated the flawed delaying tactics used by the family company of former President Donald Trump, the newspaper noted. (In a public ruling in April, Trump himself was cited for contempt for responding inadequately to subpoenas involving his business practices).*


Everyone knows that the only time that one term twice impeached former President Trump is guaranteed to tell the truth is when his mouth is closed.

>*The one-day 2021 trial, in which prosecutors asserted the organization ‚Äúwillfully disobeyed‚Äù orders for records, was kept private because the subpoenas were issued by a grand jury whose work is secret, the Times reported. The order to pay the contempt fine was unsealed last week.*


The narcissistic sociopath, __unhinged insurrectionist,__ and grifter (with a pronounced case of logorrhea) known as one term twice impeached former President Trump has a pattern of explaining, excusing, deflecting and blaming others for the circumstances he finds himself in.

 
Anything one term twice impeached former President Trump can do or say to keep justice from moving forward? He will.

And we all know the writing is on the wall.

>*On Dec. 6, a New York jury found Trump Organization companies guilty of fraud and other financial crimes in a 15-year scheme that enriched executives and enabled them to dodge income tax. Trump, who wasn‚Äôt personally charged, called the prosecution a ‚Äúwitch hunt.‚Äù*


The Republican Party *currently supports* autocracy, bribes, bullying, cheating, control of a woman's body, dismantling the US Constitution, fascism, fear, fraud, hatred, insurrectionists, racism, stealing top secret government documents, white supremacy, __pursuit of alternative facts (lies)__ and grifting.

Does it surprise anyone that their leader is one term twice impeached former President Trump?",1
Ah yes‚Ä¶the SECRET trials! Damn you secret trials!,1

"So, lets see... how to further attempt to make villains out of libraries that allow for ""drag readings"" for kids...

1) Make the assumption that the two things are somehow equal. This is outright false, as the whole point of allowing someone in different gendered or sexed dress read to kids is meant to show inclusion and break down assumptions about other people. Mr. Cameron's ideology is the exact opposite of this.

2) Make Mr. Cameron into some kind of victim being turned down...*because he's Christian?* No, because he's attempting to be an activist Christian. He is well known for his non-inclusive and frankly hateful beliefs. 

3) Assume the damn book warrants a reading to kids at a library. I don't know for sure, but I don't think the Drag Queens are reading from their own books. Is there any merit to Mr. Cameron's book? Is it good? Is his message and is the intent of this entire stunt worth the time and resources of a **publicly funded institution?**",1
Let the Screwball Evangelicals and the Drag Queens read to each other. I don't want either group around young children. Growing up is confusing enough without tales of invisible sky demons and men pretending to be women. A pox on both their houses when it comes to kids.,1

So many people waltz in here and think story hour is just a bunch of random kids in a room with any person available reading to them at whatever time of day. Story hours are planned, themed, include crafts and interaction, and need to be run by someone who has been thoroughly vetted with background checks and references. This is why it's a full time, library staffed position and the story hours are divided by age groups and have waitlists. Cameron's publishing house called specific libraries that have hosted drag story hours in the past and asked if someone from their publishing house could host a biblical story hour ""against 'woke' culture and CRT."" Of course the library said no. And the library STILL said you could book a room and host it yourself. And it's still being spun like the library refused Kirk Cameron's book. Never in the calls with this publishing house was Kirk Cameron and his book even brought up. This publisher is just a marketing whiz and came up with a great way to drum up free publicity.",1

"I clicked into link, issue 1 arises with the word ‚ÄúCalifornia‚Äù. The laws there are exceptionally strict and technically in violation of 2A but that‚Äôs another discussion. This is a home made firearm and some build things simply to build things. Even having a part of an Armalite Rifle (AR..that‚Äôs what that actually means, Armalite is a company and it is shortened to AR which has been re-labeled to claim that means Assault Rifle)

So yeah I‚Äôd say simply having an AR upper as well as a homemade firearm with no serial number would absolutely be illegal there. Some build them simply to see if it can be done. Enthusiasts I suppose. To borrow from Jurassic Park‚Ä¶‚Äùhe was so preoccupied with whether or not he could he didn‚Äôt stop to think if he should.‚Äù

Then you add in California with ‚Äúapproved‚Äù firearms. Firearms sold there are ‚Äúapproved‚Äù some are not. There are weak crappy guns not allowed in California simply because they make sure to crawl through approval process. For example. A Glock 19 9mm is approved to be sold, but there some .22 and .380 caliber guns are not.

Hopefully that helps. Disclosure that I am pro 2A, and I agree that weapon should be taken as it‚Äôs not legal.",1

"I think it should be 17 or 18 years for Justices

And something like a combined 32 years in congress with maximums of 3 terms in the senate and 10 terms in the house separately (meaning if you transition from one to the other, your time in office is capped at a TOTAL of 32 years)

States with strict and severe term limits are often among the most corrupt in the country for the simple reason that the legislature becomes a training ground for future corporate lobbyists 

We don‚Äôt want that nationally

So term limits
Which are a good idea

Need to be LONG",1
"While I don't have specific formulated opinions about exactly what term limits should be for various elected or appointed positions, I am wholly in favor of them and believe that we need to look both at the number of terms one can serve and add a mandatory retirement expectation. 

Well fed and careful for people (the wealthy types that are most often elected) live long lives these days. And yes, some people maintain their faculties and abilities well into their 70s or even 80s... but I don't think they should be governing at that point. I don't believe that a person of that age is usually in touch with the majority of generations behind them, not in any meaningful way. Yes, I'm sure there are cases that prove otherwise, but I don't feel they're the rule, just the exception. 

SCOTUS is an excellent example of this for me. They say they're there just to maintain the rule of law and not to set policy, but we have all seen recently this is just not the case. It is impossible for someone to not inject their own personal beliefs and wishes , especially when their work has such a reaching and important influence. I don't believe that someone should hold onto a position of importance until they just physically can't anymore. And I don't believe that an 80 year old judge can really appreciate the ramifications of their legal opinions on people 60 years their junior.

Appoint a judge. All the way to the Supreme Court, then make them retire by age 65. Period.",1
"But presidents only get 8 years? 
Say Joe Biden is the first to appoint these justices in 2023, then he serves 8 years in office, from 2020 to 2028.
Then let's say the next president is elected twice also, from 2028 to 2036, :/ the justices cannot be appointed.. 
I might've misread this, but I really don't understand how presidents would get to appoint Justices twice, since you're saying justices will get 18 years each..",1
I‚Äôd even like them to no longer list parties and simply list policies. People vote only for party which is insane.,1
"Why long? :/ I thought the point of term limits was to prevent an authoritarian installment in our government, as well as get new ideas, if we have the same people, our laws will stay the same for a long time, we'll evolve into an unevolved society..",1
"Then we'd have a less flow of ideas, as that's the objective in adding term limits, we want new ideas.",1
"Sorry, I recognize that I wasn't clear in my previous post (damned typing on a phone).  One justice is appointed every other year (let's say during the odd years so there's less pressure around elections/campaign seasons).  So if we worked back a couple of years, Biden would get one in each of '21 and '23 (and maybe 2 more in '25 and '27).  Then, another president gets one each in '29 and '31 (and maybe 2 more in '33 and '35).  Then, the next president gets one in '37 and again in '39 (the one appointed in '39 would replace the one appointed in '21). And so on and so forth.  As for how to ""phase out"" the current justices, I think an obvious solution would be that they'd be phased out in order of their current tenure on the court.  


One of the things I'd like about this approach is that the justices would (ideally) reflect the more current will of the voters.  If this system had been in place from the time the court expanded to 9 justices, the current makeup of the court would be 5-4 liberal appointees, with a 6-3 court when the next justice is appointed.",1
"I answered your question already. States with term limits have the most corruption because the legislature essentially becomes a space people enter to get noticed by lobbyists.

If there‚Äôs no longevity, the incentives are only to focus on how congress gets you to the NEXT thing. 

On top of that, institutional memory is important. As is legislators having enough time to build skills and relationships to get things done. 

We need some changeover because some people are in power too long, and we need parties to be better incentivized to build a bench. BUT we don‚Äôt want more corruption",1
"Actually, yk, that's not exactly a bad idea..
In fact it's a good idea.. then we wouldn't have people upset about how Biden chose these nine justices, so next presidents wouldn't feel like they would have to change the law bc of who Biden did or didn't appoint..
It's like unbiased.

:3 Smart.",1
":/ Maybe lobbyists aren't the problem, maybe we should vote for people who have steady beliefs..

Idk where the conversation is at anymore..",1
I think we need to live in the real world and pursue political and policy strategies that are proven to work rather than just wishing for things to be different and hoping whatever policy feels good achieves that,1
"Yeah, like national term limits, it works for our presidents, we've seen that for decades..
We also need more representatives, :/ the population is growing, and so should the representative's population..

Imagine, we'll have 1,108 in Congress, including the 100 senators, and if they can't possess decade long career, and we have over 1,000 delegates, lobbyism will die..
There's too many delegates, how can you convince them all? They keep changing every few years too, it'll give the youth an opportunity to see how voting works, young people are the ones who don't vote typically..",1
"I think we need more representatives too but you aren‚Äôt grounding your ideas in an understanding of policy, this country, or how any of this works",1
"I know how it works? I studied it all, I'm very interested..
'_' I'm saying how it should work however, expressing my opinions, not how it is currently..",1
"I‚Äôm just seeing wishful thinking without a theory of the case

I‚Äôm sorry",1
"I don't understand.. 
It's ok, no need to apologize",1
What don‚Äôt you understand,1
Why you say wishful thinking or whatever.. yo no comprendo,1
"Because all you keep saying is ‚Äúimagine this‚Äù and ‚Äúit would be good if that‚Äù

You‚Äôre not explaining how or why you think it would be achievable 

And your general ideas of why you think these things would be good also don‚Äôt make sense to me",1
":/ but like it would be good for us to adopt congressional term limits because then that would offer more ideas in our government, as well as make young people want to vote more.
Imagine if we had more people in Congress also, this is good because it would be more difficult for lobbyists to persuade the 1108 congressman and women..

Did I improve?",1
"No. Sorry. 

I‚Äôve provided a concrete reason why term limits should be applied with the caveat that they would be LONG because there is evidence from state legislatures that they INCREASE corruption (https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2018/01/18/five-reasons-to-oppose-congressional-term-limits/amp/) 

And you just keep going ‚Äú :/ but ‚Äú instead of actually engaging with the point",1
"I can't engage with that point though? You hadn't mentioned it, however you're not necessarily wrong, with Congress having term limits, that would motivate lobbyists to lobby as much as possible.

States like TN have term limits, and as we know they joined the confederacy.. they've had corruption before term limits..

Many things states do is corrupt however, Kansas'governor made so many promises, Texas and New Mexico may or may not have government authorities connected with the Cartel. :/ And Hawaii's the poorest state, with most of the homeless being natives. 
So from all of that, it seems to me like term limits really don't intertwine in any of the corruption of the states.

I'm open to ideas, and progress, I've observed your concern. 
However, I don't find it all that necessary, as corruption exists even if there's no term limits.. 
Term limits are needed for the president, you haven't shown any non-support of this, but do you agree with the 22 amendment? 
If you can agree with that, then how can you disagree with the same thing for congress members? 
Our government doesn't need aged people in power, I, and many Americans don't want a nursing home as our government. 
Not only that, but term limits welcome new ideas.

Also, term limits are supposed to ensure tranquility, which is what the Constitution claims we must have, '_' are you saying you disagree with the Constitution?

If that's the case, I can't imagine you supporting libertarian ideals..",1

The deplorables have turned on each other! Such a shock! Smh...,1
The GOP are so far off what the rest of America wants and needs.,1
Mystery candidate!  Oh how exciting.  It‚Äôs reality TV with out govt now!,1
This sounds like an excellent way to have a Democrat elected speaker in a majority Republican House.,1
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahajahahahahahahahahahajahahahahahahaha+ha‚ôæÔ∏è= ‚ôæÔ∏èHa,1
Watching these idiots do anything is going to be chaotic and hilarious. Whoever gets the gavel is going to be doing a job akin to herding 300 feral cats into a small cage. They‚Äôll eat their own. I hope McCarthy does win. It‚Äôll be fun watching him deal with team crazy and team normal and the democrats who I hope do everything they can to make sure he‚Äôs miserable and wishes he never got the Speaker. Stupid twats.,1
No honor among thieves.,1
He‚Äôll probably nominate Trumpf.,1
We‚Äôre going to need a bigger bowl of popcorn‚Ä¶,1
"Forcing another candidate to come out of the woodwork and run for the seat might be a good idea.

>*Biggs and his right-wing colleagues in the House Freedom Caucus hope to force party leaders to share more power with rank-and-file members instead of deciding on bills behind closed doors and then putting them up for a vote without much member input.*

Many Republicans have come forward and said they would not vote for McCarthy

>*McCarthy needs 218 votes to win when the House selects its speaker in January, and it will take as few as five Republican nays to thwart his victory.*

Clearly, America is not interested in the stolen election theories put forth by one term twice impeached former President Trump.

The reason we know this to be true? America came out in droves, and they voted during the last election.

>*Biggs, who has served in Congress since 2017 and was directly involved in former President Donald Trump‚Äôs attempt to overthrow the 2020 election, can‚Äôt get 218 votes, either. But he believes someone else will rise to the occasion.*

America is not interested in Trumpism and all other standards for.

>*But McCarthy has already said that he‚Äôll restore Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) to the committee seats that Democrats denied them because of their conspiracy theories and threatening behavior.*

We need accountability.

Clearly, that is what America voted for during our last election.

Republicans need to listen to the voters if they hope to accomplish anything positive for America.",1
They can't even listen to the voters.,1
"Unlikely. Near impossible. BUT if Democrats throw their support behind McCarthy to give him the speakeship, they could get a favorable deal on the debt ceiling and committed positions. If he doesn‚Äôt, they could threaten to elevate Biggs‚Äô candidate to the position. A Democratic Senate can check a far-right Speaker, so this would be more about weakening the Speaker position far more than McCarthy wants.",1
"OMG.

The nightmare.",1
"Yes.

And extra root-beer.",1
The problem in politics for doing something in exchange for something else is there's absolutely no way to police it. He could agree to it and then after he's elected speaker not agree to it. I'm sure there's a process to pluck him out though. Like a vote of no confidence or something.,1
I would not trust McCarthy on any deal he makes.,1
If Democrats think any Republican has the slightest integrity and would follow through with any deal made they‚Äôre even stupider than they obviously are.,1
"Then impeach Biden and then Harris and then ‚Ä¶

(Yes, I realize that there would never be a conviction in the senate, but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if that was what he was thinking)",1
"It‚Äôs no less enforceable than any deal McCarthy can cut with Biggs to back down. But if you can‚Äôt trust the Speaker to honor his word, you can‚Äôt trust him to hold a vote on that bill you want passed or anything else. Being Speaker means having sustained support.",1
"I‚Äôm not banking on McCarthy having integrity, I‚Äôm banking on him being able to foresee consequences for his own self interest",1
It's a fair point.,1
"I watched a video by a liberal lawyer. He agreed with the ruling and said this is the judge telling the DOJ to indict now or drop the case. The contempt of court declaration would be very weak anyway. Does the DOJ think it would make Trump comply? He has lied to their faces and on paper over and over. 

Time to indict.",1
Good. Though it's taking forever for any consequences to actually reach him.,1
Why this special privilege - we all know this guy is a criminal! ‚ÄúNo one is above the law‚Äù in my view is total bullshit!,1
"Stolen classified documents. Has been photographed with caught spies. An lied about having any more stolen documents.  

All of this after inspiring an insurrection and spreading lies that undermine democracy. 

All of that after ""enjoying"" downplaying the seriousness of a pandemic in which a million people died. Statics show his actions are responsible for 40% of their deaths!

There's no good reason Trump and his accomplises should be in the office or walking around free.",1
"Having worked primarily in criminal law, I can say with some degree of certainty that criminal cases are not swift. And, this is a sensitive case although it shouldn‚Äôt be. You do not want to be the person to indict a former president and then lose the case because you left room for error. Although we don‚Äôt see it or hear it, I can also assure you that there are a lot of attorneys and paralegals researching every single aspect of this matter. They need to have all the facts and details and evidence (which they are lacking because it seems as if Trump has documents all over the place. Who knows? Maybe he‚Äôs sold some documents to the highest bidder already? There could be many reasons why they haven‚Äôt indicted him yet.) However, I believe they will at some point in the future. Again, federal prosecutors win something like 95% of the cases they bring against defendants. Also, I don‚Äôt think we will see Trump in prison . Like, ever. He has secret service protection for the rest of his miserable life. What are they gonna do? Hang out in the pokey and make sure no one hard dicks him when he drops the soap with his freaky baby hands? Our best hope is that he loses everything. Mara Lago, his jet, his wife..everything. It‚Äôd be nice to see him living in a little two bedroom house with a 10 year old Honda that he can only drive to the store and church because he‚Äôs gotta wear an ankle bracelet the rest of his even more miserable life. I think prison would be too good for him. He‚Äôd be a hero with the white supremacy crowd. A two bedroom house with no internet would be the perfect way for him to live out his days.",1
I‚Äôm happy for Trump. Hope he wins 2024 üá∫üá∏,1
"I do agree. Don‚Äôt bring a case you can‚Äôt win! The feds are known for bringing cases and a great win ratio. I was hoping this was the issue with the DOJ being slow with Donnie. Still hoping. Detested this bastard for decades( I am THAT old) I want to see him( he won‚Äôt ever do prison time), broke( I mean really broke) and NEVER to be able to hold office anywhere. Sadly he will still have a voice. Shame it went from commenting on Diet Coke and Robert Paxton‚Äôs love life to playing POTUS.",1
"Actually, every modern president has had similar privileges. Like how our previous 5 presidents weren't impeached over war crimes or taking government property, but they all did it. He's a giant douche and taking all these documents was inappropriate, but at the end of the day who cares. 

There's bigger fish to fry. Like universal health care or even PAID TIME OFF for railway workers.",1
"It takes a DOJ/AG willing to go after him.

We have neither.",1
"Truly.

It boggles the mind how Republicans can just sweep things under the carpet. In order to pretend:

‚ñ† it never happened.

‚ñ† that no one will notice.

Everyone who cares notices.",1
Move on to what? Acceptance of a lawless government?,1
"Looks like:  This is an insincere leading statement trying to establish themselves as part of the ‚Äògroup‚Äô and make people feel left out and uncool if they aren‚Äôt part of ‚Äòmoving on‚Äô that the poster is advocating.

I would bet money that later in this thread the poster goes full mask-off and dives into Q adjacent conspiracy theory territory.

I‚Äôll scroll down and if I‚Äôm wrong will edit this comment with contrition.

EDIT: I was correct.  Im not surprised but I‚Äôm still disappointed.",1
"Moving on is what trump and his moron acolytes should have done after the disgraced ex-president failed in his re-election bid. But he didn‚Äôt, so someone needs to wipe the shit stain off of the public stage and flush his ass to obscurity.",1

"Honestly it probably still is a big part of it. If you really think about it its not like any of these crimes were simple and carried out by just him. On his own he couldn't have done half of what he did. There are at least dozens of people if not more mixed up in everything. 

To be clear I do think we absolutely should have enough to bring at least some charges, and honestly I wish they would bc the rest can be pursued for a long time. But I'm entirely positive its a much more complicated investigation than most of us can fully comprehend not being in the loop.",1

But it still took over two years for the investigation and hearings to finally turn up enough evidence to convince enough Republican senators to vote for convicting him, so those Republicans then went to him and told him he needed to resign because they weren't behind him any more.

If he didn't, it probably would have been another full year for a completed investigation, ducks in a row, and impeachment trial.

"Right, Republicans didn't dump Trump because he was convicted of criminal tax fraud, or that he illegally took classified documents after he left office (which is what he wanted Hillary Clinton locked up for), no, they dumped him because after conservatives took away women's rights and lost elections, rather than blame themselves, they decided to blame Trump.",1

Wrong. It would prove that the Republican Party likes useful idiots over quality candidates,1

Their whole use of him in that regard IS the racism.,1

When I heard the crap about Obama being POTUS for 8 years,and saw the great loss of house seats, because a black man won the presidency, I knew Trump would win.

The vast majority of people I know, who‚Äôve given him support, are suburban & rural ‚ÄúGo Dawgs‚Äù types who will shit on the University of Georgia for being a bastion protecting liberal ideas‚Äîdespite watching their team play every Saturday. It‚Äôs fucking ridiculous.",1
No. It would mean there was another blithering idiot in our government.,1

Because they would have elected their favorite football player?,1
"Sorry, Lindsey, the GOP nominating an unfit person for an office because of their celebrity shows not just that you are racist but also not faithful to the fundamental principles of democracy.

Yes.,1

Are their any sources for this? I assumed corruption but I couldn‚Äôt really find much I know he does get big donations from the oil and fossil fuel industry but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs directly the same thing,1
Yeah but don‚Äôt those pay more than 15 dollars usually? Probably because they are dangerous,1
Actually it isn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ If you look at the average salary it‚Äôs actually greater than 15 I just don‚Äôt see a reason,1
"To the people who are downvoting me without offering an argument against me, $15 an hour is 30k a year, in a place where you can get a decent 2 bed/2 bath apartment for $700 a month in the biggest city in the state.

West Virginia is dirt poor, and minimum wages need to be set based on cost of living, not some vague number.",1
Those are most certainly corporate sponsors,1
"If you can get a job paying well NOT mining coal, how long are you gonna be a coal miner?",1
"‚Ä¶ duh‚Ä¶ the average is the middle point of all incomes averaged out. About 50% of incomes should be below the average and 50% above‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs how an average works.

Edit: that‚Äôs actually more a median salary, but as a rule of thumb it works for averages as well +/- 10%",1
Yeah but don‚Äôt those industries usually pay 15 dollars per hour at the minimum? That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm kinda confused,1
The median is the middle value the average/mean is different,1
‚ÄúThe mean (average) of a data set is found by adding all numbers in the data set and then dividing by the number of values in the set.‚Äù,1
"He gets campaign donations from a variety of industries, not just fossil fuels",1
"Please note the edit. As a general rule of thumb the numbers will not be far of in terms of reported incomes.

Median is 51k vs average of 59k for WV. Either way, my point stands.",1
This is an article I found of the various industries that give him donations but all of these usually pay more than 15 that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm confused [source](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/10/a-closer-look-at-joe-manchins-ties-to-the-fossil-fuel-industy/),1
I found other companies like Lowe‚Äôs and CVS arhat also donate to him,1
Can you give a source?,1
"Same, but, if the candidates for President were Warnock against literally any other Republican, I'd vote Warnock.",1
"Well he won a Senate seat, not the presidency so I'm not sure what the problem is.",1
Party most certainly matters especially when religion is involved. The religious left is in no way comparable to the religious right. I do agree that we definitely don‚Äôt need any more religion in our politics irregardless of political affiliation.,1
What if you had to pick between a fascist and a former Reverend?  Because that would probably be this hypothetical race.,1
"This reminds me of the 2012 Presidential election. If I had to pick between Romney and Warnock, I would pick Warnock. Romney's religious views would have probably affected certain minority communities. While Warnock would probably respect all communities.",1
"Potentially he is the kind of religious that understands that all people are created equal and that the separation of church and state is real and constitutional. It‚Äôs the Southern right wing religious nuts that shun logic, history and science that are a threat.",1
"He is not the kind of pastor who wants to blur the lines of the separation of church and state. He is guided by his principles, they are not a means of legislation. He will be consistent to his faith. Obama, Clinton, Carter and Kennedy were all guided by their faith. 

What specifically would concern you?",1
Not exactly a convincing win either especially as he was up against someone clearly less qualified than a potato.,1
"Is he being floated for president at this point? Huh.

Anyway, I‚Äôd not by default be against an activist pastor from his particular tradition.",1
okay.,1
"President Carter was a Deacon and Sunday school teacher, but I think that‚Äôs the closest to a preacher that we‚Äôve had.",1
"As far a chrisitan reverend I would agree. However, an atheist reverend like me could be qualified for my vote.",1
The Cons heads would explode..,1
"Transplant to Georgia checking in...

Warnock would probably not be too interested in being Commander in Chief.

I don't see it happening, but if he won the primary I'd support him 100%.",1
"Not happening anyway.

A black person will very likely (unfortunately) not be allowed to be President (again) in my lifetime. 

If something were to happen that President Biden could not exercise his office, and VP Harris were to become President - even temporarily - imagine the hue and cry there would be.

I thought much the same when Mayor Pete Buttigieg was running for president as an openly gay man (full disclosure: I originally come from not far from South Bend, where he was Mayor; to me he's ""local boy makes good"").

There are still way too many troglodytes in this country.",1
No preacher president for me,1
Who wants this guy on the presidential ballot? As the incumbent he barely beat Herschel The Warewolf Walker. Democrats are going to have to be very deliberate with selecting candidates since there‚Äôs no such thing as a sure thing anymore.,1
People fighting me about this is classic.  They have no problem with a pastor of THEIR religion.  How privileged.,1
Calm down. The guy barely won a race that should have been a slam dunk. He‚Äôs not running for president.,1
"Personally, I don't find him to be presidential. I am very grateful that he didn't take the low road in his campaign against Walker when he certainly had opportunity. Being presidential is about diplomacy on a world stage. It's about being firm in dealing with the legislative branch and selecting responsible Judges. 

Warnock is green and seemingly na√Øve.",1
"Good gravy this seemed to tick of some fellow liberals.  At least we are not a cult.  Sorry you can‚Äôt see past your Xian beliefs to see how a reverend of a faith can seem troubling for some,of us.  How privileged.",1
So... one stupid MSNBC piece and you're gauging interest... but disagreeing with said piece? Seems like a reach.,1
"I mean, wanting a separation between Church & State should be normal. A fictional book with absolutely no tangible proof of anything remotely factual, shouldn't have any hold on real people's daily lives. We live in twilight zone reality, it's just normalized because it's all we know. Traditional ideology is what holds us back from our next evolution as a species.. it'll be what ends the human race in my opinion of course.",1
I won't speak specifically for Warnock but I wouldn't have a problem with a pastor running for president. Not all pastors are alike and there's no reason to believe that just because someone has served in that role they can't also uphold the Constitution and act in the best interest of the country.,1
"The extent to which religion instructs someone to apply dogma in their secular life varies by person and by creed.

I'd have more of a problem with a 'lay' person from LDS or People of Praise.  In both of those cases, members are instructed to carry out their religion's commands in all aspects of life, including working to proselytize and convert others.

As far as I can tell, Senator Warnock does not use his public service to attempt to enforce his beliefs on others, and does not belong to denomination that instructs him to do so.",1
I mean- does he believe in the separation of church and state? Does he believe in governing fairly and following laws? There‚Äôs a lot more to the conversation than his original career choice. I would choose a minister over the owner of a gun related saloon any day.,1
"Mike Pence was vice president, youre saying Warnock would be more jesusy and ridiculous?",1
Thanks! Sentiment is the same!,1
I would as well.,1
People are saying he needs to run for President.  Happy to have him as our 51st vote in the Senate.,1
"Well of course any Dem over a GOP Fascist.  We don‚Äôt always get the Dem we want, but usually the Dem we deserve.",1
"Yes, a perfect and perhaps possible scenario. It‚Äôs really concerning.   I disagree with Romney‚Äôs views and he would not get my vote, but I have a serious issue with having a religious leader being the leader of USA.  It‚Äôs not how we were built or meant to be.",1
"Yes, it‚Äôs not so much Warnock, but the concept.  Imagine if he did run and win.  What does the GOP put up and what if/when they win?  We become a Christian Fascist nation.",1
"Guided by faith and having a job preaching the faith are 2 different things.  At least how I see it. Every president has been Xian, not every President has made a living be a Shepherd of his faith.",1
The potato nearly won,1
MSNBC was doing it today on deadline WH.,1
I would too over any MAGA but I sure would try and find an non company man of a religious dogma in the primaries so I would not have to make that choice.,1
"Wasn‚Äôt Obama President and black?  How young are you?  But yes, I don‚Äôt see how that happens again. The right will burn it down before they let that happen again.",1
MSNBC was walking it this afternoon.  It‚Äôs why I posted it to gage reaction.,1
It was MSNBC. So please don‚Äôt tell me to calm anything.,1
I‚Äôm so glad he is our 51st Senator for all the reasons you list!,1
"Religious liberty would necessarily include not disqualifying someone based on their religious involvement. 

Given the options from the other party, who gives a shit? Warnock is good stuff especially for American politics.",1
It not a reach when a major liberal news network floats the idea and I respond as a liberal who doesn‚Äôt think a pastor should be president.  I didn‚Äôt even need to stretch out prior to posting.,1
Where did I say that?  Re- read the part. The very 1st part.  Where I praise Sen Warnock.,1
">I have zero interest in having a person who was a Reverend

>*I'd vote Warnock.*

>I would as well.

Way to contradict yourself. Just say you don't like religion and go",1
Agreed but an Atheist president would lose bad. You gotta at least lie and pretend to love jesus,1
"""People"" in general say that with just about any politician except for Ted Cruz",1
Lol yea.  My point is that there were a lot of people who found reasons like this to sit out or vote third party in the 2016 cycle.  Now Roe v Wade is overturned and we‚Äôll have a conservative majority SCOTUS for a couple decades at least.  So how‚Äôd that work out?,1
"I'm 54 and don't remember EVER getting the Dem I wanted. I'm not complaining, because that's how democracy works for most of us and I'm just thankful we live in a democracy.",1
"I agree. But I doubt we will ever see Romney get the repub nomination again. But there are plenty of other possibilities in the future, case in point, Mike Pence.",1
"Not if democrats and rational republicans keep participating in elections while shutting down religious extremists. 

We can hope the trend continues.",1
"That does depend on the individual and the culture of the congregation. Some are certainly in the business of marketing their church. Others simply see their role as shepherding their flock. The role of a pastor is mainly working on the outreach of the congregations mission work and visiting those in the church who are sick or shut ins. Sunday mornings and sermons get the attention, but is a relatively small portion.",1
"And really, isn‚Äôt that the scary thing.",1
That‚Äôs just them filling air time,1
Wow. This seems precipitous.,1
I should have said ANOTHER black president. I voted for Obama in 08 and 12.,1
Sheesh. There will be a president Comacho in my lifetime.,1
Barely winning in a faintly purple state is equivalent to a crushing win in a blue state.,1
"As a gay person who has had the church lead the way in oppression, I kinda give a shit.  Re-read my post. I like him, I don‚Äôt like religions leaders being president.  There is a difference.  And yes, of course Warnock is better than anything the GOP puts up, but that doesn‚Äôt force me to have to like his occupation or the previous company he worked at, and will always for for (the church).",1
"I don‚Äôt like religion in the WH, but Xian vs MAGA‚Ä¶ I will pick Xian.  And also, I‚Äôm staying. Don‚Äôt tell me to go anywhere, you sound like a Xian when do demand I do something to make you feel better.",1
I wish you weren't right,1
Trump - 'It's a bible',1
"Spot on. And very few of the founding fathers were actually Christian in thought. Enlightenment was huge then. A lot of Deists. Now, someone has to hold a Bible to be POTUS. Sad. Backward.",1
Every President has been a Xian. Not one of them them earned a living preaching the word (if memory serves).  It‚Äôs a bit too much religion in the office already. Having a pro sitting in the chair doesn‚Äôt seem right for a country that touts religious liberty.,1
You have to pretend to be a Protestant - even being catholic counts against you.,1
"You can confuse them once in a while and just pronounce it Jeebuzz once in a while, but not every time.",1
Just like trump did!,1
"As much as I wish this weren't the case, it's true. I mean, Donald Trump wasn't a Christian before his presidential run and he's not a Christian now, but he was willing to lie about it, and the base ate that up. I would love a secular president, but we still live in a country where 40% of the population believes in Noah's Ark and that the Earth is only 6,000 years old, so I don't see a path to the white house for anyone that's openly atheist.",1
And thank God for that!  (Irony 100% intended here),1
"Yup, I have always voted.  I would not vote for Warnock in the Primary.  And I would be very nervous to have a religious leader of any religion as President of the US.  Still better than a Nazi however.  It‚Äôs a sad choice if it came to that.",1
"I‚Äôm 52 here and Obama in 08 was the only time my primary pick actuality won the WH.  It‚Äôs the curse of being a Dem and not living in a cult of a party.  The more diversity the better, but that means my candidate doesn‚Äôt always win.",1
"Neither were working as a pastor.  Biden is VERY faithful, perhaps more that Pence or Romney.  None of those guys made a living as a Pastor. There is a distinction there for me.  It‚Äôs Rev Warnock job and life to bring those to the faith.  It‚Äôs in his job description.  How does he separate that in the WH?  How does the next person who may not have the great moral compass that Warnock does?",1
Yup!  Lol,1
"I'm not, but the condescension towards religion is one reason the right is able to capture so many voters.

>I don‚Äôt like religion in the WH,

Bro WHAT? We have NEVER had a non-religious president. I would like it change too but in the short term it's a pretty unrealistic thing to hope for.",1
"What is your favorite passage, sir? <caught flat footed> Well that's very personal to me. 
Do you like the new or the Old Testament? 
I like both testaments the same. The Old Testament it's just that it's so... old. Where the New Testament is so much... newer.",1
"I get your concern, but I would not assume an atheist president would attempt to impose their beliefs on anyone. Why do you assume this man would?",1
Garfield was a minister for an organization called the Disciples of Christ. It's a little more complicated than that. But he did a lot of lobbying for them. It's actually a really interesting dive.,1
Biden is catholic.,1
"I realize my examples aren't religious leaders but I don't really feel there would be any difference between just being devout and actually being a religious leader, currently or previously. I doubt they would separate it.

The reason I bring up Romney and Pence, is because of their brand of religion they choose to subscribe to, if you will. I doubt they would have any problem signing a law that disadvantaged groups in support of others. Pence actually did about a decade ago as Governor of Indiana.",1
">It‚Äôs Rev Warnock job and life to bring those to the faith.  It‚Äôs in his job description. 

No it's not. He's a reverend, not a missionary. His job is to live in accordance with the words of Christ, and to encourage others who are already wanting to do that. He is not paid to proselytise, and despite what Dominionists such as Pence will tell you, the Bible not only says nothing against abortion, it gives instructions for a priest to perform one. 

Pence, as a Dominionist, wants to instigate a theocracy to force his religion, particularly chastity, bigotry and anti-abortion beliefs on every woman in America, severely damaging the health, privacy, and independence of women. 

Warnock has not pushed any religion or laws based on religious ideas, and he's representing a party which would not vote in agreement with any efforts to impose religion-based restrictions.",1
The fact that he is a successful Democrat to me means he has separated religion from his senator duties.,1
The condescending attitude of religious folks on my life is what drove me away from the church. I guess what comes around goes around. We literally just passes a law which carves out legal religious bigotry and we all cheered.  God Bless America,1
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like religion in the WH‚Äù I should clarify that.  A religious LEADER in the WH.  I get that we are a primary Xian country and ALL our presidents have been Xian.  I just don‚Äôt need a preacher in that role.,1
Two corinthians,1
"Eh, to be fair one of those has a loooooooong history of trying to impose their will on others, the other one id be interested in some examples bc I haven't really seen any significant ones. 

History counts.",1
"It‚Äôs his job?  That is what a pastor does.  Every president has been religious, not every president made a living being religious.",1
An atheist would impose their non belief.,1
He has‚Ä¶will the next?  Religious leaders should not run the country.  I don‚Äôt understand why everyone seems like I‚Äôm being extreme here.,1
"Is that more than a brasillion, said Trump, maybe... Probably",1
"I don‚Äôt wanna be that guy but 

Stalin literally did this",1
"That is because it isnt newsworthy to discuss the actions of religious organizations that simply carry out their creed of love. Once Oral Roberts told the world that God said he would die unless his church received 6 million dollars, the world only gets updates on the charlatans. I'm certainly not perfect by any definition of the word, but I wont be a member of a congregation that isnt mission oriented first and foremost. 

And I completely understand why you feel the way you do. But I would challenge you to do some searching. There are wonderful things done across this country simply because there are people who are trying to fulfill the teaching of their faith. Jim and Tammy Faye Baker notwithstanding.",1
"Imposing your beliefs is not a pastors job. It is to lead worship and to harness the faith of the congregation to do the outreach that is described in the stories of the Bible, Quran, Torah, etc. 

I do understand why people think that way because so many out there are doing it for the profitability and the prestige of the position.",1
I know but that still counts against them - why - because people keep mentioning it - it‚Äôs a way the more mainstream religions in the US try to say - he‚Äôs not like us.,1
I don‚Äôt necessarily disagree with you. I just think it will be hard to get a good candidate who is also separated strongly from religion. I don‚Äôt know the stat but isn‚Äôt there a pretty high % of believers of some sort in the US? I myself am a fallen Catholic so there‚Äôs that.ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,1
"Lol I'll look into it. I wasn't kidding, I'm interested. My main point stands that one side has a significantly more prolific history of trying to force their religion on others. That being said more information is always better, even if it's not what I expect, like or agree with. So I appreciate it.",1
"I didn't say churches never do good things, I said they have a very long history of trying to do impose their will on others.",1
It‚Äôs all I have ever seen the American Christian church do is impose its beliefs. Why would I think otherwise?,1
"I should be clear, I understand that most (if not all) presidents have had strong Christian believes (Ahem‚Ä¶Trump, not so much).  I don‚Äôt have an issue with that nearly as strong as I do with someone who is an actual Pastor of the Church.  Going to pray on Sunday is one thing as a US President.  Leading the prayer is a whole new thing for our Democracy that I‚Äôm just not comfortable with.  There is a difference.  Even if Sen Warnock would lead a great, liberal, inclusive prayer like Jesus taught, I just don‚Äôt think that is the job of the President and I don‚Äôt see how someone could serve both.",1
"They are not all like that.  Some lead to faith, not impose it.

Its the difference between religion and actual faith.

With that said, I do not want a preacher as president.  Even if they didn't cross those paths, it would blur lines which need to be clear.",1
That just means you have a narrow view of pastors.,1
So I would expect he would have to give up his job as reverend. This is an interesting thought you posted here and got me thinking. I think I too would not want a reverend as president ultimately but would take this particular one over any Republican any day of the week.ü§£,1
They have a narrow view of me.  I like Jesus. It‚Äôs his followers I have an issue with.,1
"Yes, Warnock is actually not the problem, it‚Äôs the standard that is set.   Watching a GOP Reverend being elected after him the scary moment.",1
"As a Christian, I think that is reasonable. Just do know that some of us take his teaching to heart even when it is inconvenient to our cultural norms.",1
"So what you're afraid of is not Warnock, it's the slippery slope. 

I don't believe Warnock being President, if that were to happen, would affect the likelihood of a future president being a religious leader one way or another.",1
"Yes, it‚Äôs not Warnock. I said that 1st. I called him great and he is.  But I do think this scenario would be taken advantage of by the GOP.",1
"Republicans have a history of electing rather stupid people. Bush jr, Walker (both Scott and Herschel), Trump, Perry, Palin, MTG, Boebert, Bachmann",1
They spew what they hear on Fox News. I battle with these people constantly.,1
I would argue Trump and Walker are of equal intelligence.,1
Conservatives are brainwashed.  They will vote for literally anyone with an R next to their name.  Once someone tells you they‚Äôre a right winger you don‚Äôt need to talk to them anymore.  You can hear all their opinions on Fox News.,1
Sounds like you need a new roommate,1
"No one voted for Walker because they thought he'd be a good Senator, they voted for him because they wanted a Republican Senate. So your roommate was simply being honest: he wants a fascist America.   

The part about Warren was just second hand trolling. They hate and fear her because they know she's smart.",1
Do you need help finding a new roommate?,1
"Most of my adult life I was an Independent voter. I voted for the individual and not the party.  Grant it that this turn out to be almost always a Democrat or Independent but not always. Now I would not vote for a Republican no matter how good they were because the current Republican Party is anti-democracy and a danger to the country. It does not matter if the individual is honorable and with good intentions. Look to what happened to Cheney. The party decides the agenda and the individual has little to no power. Voting for any Republican gives power to people like Greene, Jordan, Goser, etc. I will not do that.",1
The power of propaganda will make weak minded people believe anything.,1
Anyone willing to vote for Hershel Walker is not a serious person.,1
it's perfectly acceptable to not respect really dumb people saying stupid things,1
"Fox News has perfected their strategy of getting people who know nothing about politics to vote Republican. They exploit their fear, insecurity, and inadequacy in the most subtle ways. Just a constant subtle drone of ‚Äúthese democrats are at it again, trying to take away your money/way of life/racial superiority, but YOU know better. You are smart. And you‚Äôd be much more successful if the democrats weren‚Äôt constantly giving away your money and opportunities to OTHERS‚Äù",1
"Breaking dichotomous thinking, a known trait of Republican voters, is extremely difficult. It often requires a disorienting experience, therapy, or both.",1
Democrats are so demonized with propaganda that conservatives would rather vote for Satan (R) than anyone with (D),1
"Cult members will not compromise and clearly will also vote for unqualified over qualified if that is what their party machinery has drummed up. Getting their way is more important to them than respecting the fundamental principles of democracy.  
Note the astounding level of lunacy and non-sequitur they are willing to swallow in order to maintain their detachment from actual reality.",1
Elizabeth Warren is absolutely brilliant. Your roommate is a dipshit.,1
I‚Äôd be looking for a new roommate. And I‚Äôd really interview them about their world view before deciding.,1
"Ask him why.  

They usually start with the fiscally responsible economy but can never articulate why Democrats a better exonomy every time they've held office for the last 40 years.  Public policy?  Republicans don't have any policy other than saying no to anything that helps citizen and interfering in private lives.  Military?  Sure thing!  Unless it involves taking care of the actual people who serve/served.  Save the unborn?  Ok.  Then what about after they're born or providing assistance to the women/girls forced to carry them?",1
"Have you forgotten about Sarah Palin? 

I jest, but, my god, the first time I heard that idiot speak...I just..no words can describe how unbelievably stupid she sounded. It was pure incomprehensible, word salad.",1
They really do swallow all the fox news talking points and then vomit them back out at whoever isn't on their team. No critical thinking involved whatsoever,1
"In fairness, if the situation were reversed I would still vote for the unqualified Democrat because it helps give more power to all the very qualified Democrats.  I don't care if he's sitting in a corner sucking his thumb, if he votes to support everything I agree with then he's better than putting a Republican in there who will be against everything I stand for. 

That said, the problem for me isn't that they'd vote for him, the problem is that he's the one they chose to run in the first place.  I wouldn't ever need to make that choice (voting for someone unqualified) because that doesn't happen nearly as often on the Left, because we don't build our identities and campaigns around fake non-issues like whether a trans kid can use a bathroom.  Our side is like ""We need targeted tax credits to alleviate childhood poverty"" and their side is like ""If kids read the wrong book they'll dress in chipmunk costumes and fuck bags of kale!""

 As others have pointed out, the list of unarguably ignorant and demagoguing Republicans is long.  Even someone like Cruz - who is not stupid - is willing to play the fool and go along with all the stupid, false talking points that whip up their base.",1

"Let me preface this by saying that what I saw of Walker speaking was absolutely pathetic. But this: 
  
>‚ÄúSo an esteemed law professor and prolific author is an idiot?‚Äù

Is also just about as meaningless as the gibberish analogies and parables Walker was trying to say.  

Getting a degree and excelling in a narrow and particular area of law does not mean that you're overly intelligent, or even that you necessarily make good decisions. Even getting published isn't all that difficult, lots of stuff that's either erroneous, poorly thought out, or already well known gets published every year.    
An example from Warren's work:  
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Warren
>According to Warren and economists who follow her work, one of her key insights was that rising bankruptcy rates were caused not by profligate consumer spending but by middle-class families' attempts to buy homes in good school districts  
  
So they decided the bankruptcies they examined  weren't from excessive consumption, *they were from buying nicer homes than they could afford*. Which is still a form of excessive consumption because it is still living beyond your means, and I'd wager that if you dig into their data the same people likely also had excessive credit card debt from trying to cover other expenses, like some consumer goods, because the money which would normally cover some of them was being eaten up by their excessive mortgages.  
In the real world bankruptcies are virtually never from a single cause, they are instead usually the result of emergencies tipping over years of accumulated poor financial decisions.
 In 1989 when Warren and her coauthors published their book nobody but those in academia would have found the idea that people were overextending themselves to buy in better neighborhoods surprising, even the politicians talking about overconsumption probably knew that, I certainly did because I knew people who had done it and I was barely old enough to buy beer.",1
"The fact that most people here continue to call him a cultist is unsettling. You can vote for a strategic majority and still oppose whatever a politician individually intends to do.

I often voted red when the subject at hand was taxes and national security. I understood that an abortion ban was something that the party would forever offer to the crazies but never really go for when it came to legislating.

It wasn‚Äôt until elections became about the functioning of our democracy that I stopped voting Republican (the moment Trump won the nomination). And now I am literally voting, strategically, for any Democrat simply because I‚Äôd like to keep our democracy in somewhat working order.",1
"If he were a Dem, I‚Äôd vote for him.  The gop will spoon feed him. McConnell has his ducks in a row. They all vote the party line anyway.",1
"Ah‚Ä¶ this is difficult to dig into‚Ä¶ but easy to spot. Easy to dismiss, difficult to explain‚Ä¶ 
‚Ä¶ Easy to miss reading the voters motivations,
But oh so difficult to build that hope and support to choose better during elections.

I contend that it‚Äôs primarily related to poor education and/or sheltered conservative upbringing or compounded by both.

The world view that many Republicans hold is the very core of their identity. What they talk about, what they listen, what they see, what they support - all feeds into how they think and process things‚Ä¶ which then factors into their decision making. 

If all they have known is conservative values, possibly religious maybe orthodox, fed constantly by Newsmax and Fox News that America is wronging them, constantly feeding on rhetoric from Bannon or Alex Jones or the likes, they have shut themselves out of knowing other possibilities. 

The intellectual vacuum is important for them to safeguard their identity and way of living. Shaking any pillar that supports that identity is a non-starter because they hold all such pillars to be unquestionable axioms.

Therefore it‚Äôs unconscionable for them to even begin considering alternatives. It‚Äôs all black and white, their way or the highway.

I feel like for most people here (most people on Reddit even) the answer is _""Obviously nothing, because even voting for a bad Democrat candidate is better than voting for a good Republican""_, which is a perfectly understandable position.

That's just how politics works - often you support the general goals of the political party rather than the individual qualities of the candidate.

That's exactly what your roommate is doing - he probably supports broad Republican policies, so voting for Walker just means more votes in congress for those. He's not expecting much from Walker himself other than providing his votes.",1

"No, this is exactly why politics matters. This man and his cohorts vilifiy lgbtq people at every turn. This highlights the real world consequences of that kind of campaign. They‚Äôve spent an awful lot of time, money and energy categorizing these people as less deserving of dignity and legal protections as everyone else‚Ä¶this result plays out time and again in families all over this country.",1
"Agreed. Full disclosure, I'm center-right, but I'd like to see people on both sides respect that this is a human being going through her own trauma, likely for reasons entirely unrelated to her father.

The right tried to micromanage Obama's parenting, and that was also uncalled for. The left won't win any points with me or others in the center or moderate right by bashing Cruz over this. Be the bigger man here, and just wish that kid well.",1

Ehhhh‚Ä¶I agree with your overall sentiment, but [he doesn‚Äôt seem like a great, normal guy](https://youtu.be/-d99XOOLqRM) in his personal sphere either.

"Ya, a bi kid struggling in a household where Dad calls all LGBT people groomers is for sure 100% unrelated. The cruelty of Republican politics has consequences.",1
"Yea.  Bash Cruz, or Warnock or Biden or Trump, all you want.  They are public figures, and we can argue their choices, including lifestyle choices, IMO, on the basis of the facts.  Children, siblings and parents of public figures who choose not to make their lives public, we should respect that.",1

Depends on your definition of therapy.,1

"It's also equally possible they never get bullied and are well liked kids at school.  Bottom line, neither of us know so that's the only fact here. 

Personally I hope all is okay same holds for anyone having kids go thru something like this.  Imo, I think w things like this it's healthy to park partisan politics at the back door.  There is a lot more going on in life other than how a person votes.  Not directed at you yet it's sad how many folks have forgotten what compassion is.",1
"Yeah, heard a story about Texas state police found his wife crying on the side of the interstate several years ago so I doubt he's a peach to live with.",1
They are certainly making a lot of Biden‚Äôs kids issues that‚Äôs for sure. It‚Äôs not nice when they do it either.,1
"Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I feel immensely for this child. But considering who her father is, it puts a necessary spotlight on the horrendous way many in the Republican Party talk about and treat our fellow Americans who are members of the lgbtq community. That kind of talk has real consequences and nobody is immune from experiencing those consequences. My criticism is fully with me Cruz and his ilk.",1

"yea, that's my point.  This is sensationalized reporting that serves noone.  It's also not politics.

Not necessarily disagreeing, just looking for elaboration",1
At least they have a friend like you.,1

I try. I still have a lot to learn.,1
"When I got out of the military I moved into a small 4-plex one of the people living there was trans. We became friends I adored her, but had no idea until she got some mail with her old name on it. It sounds insane I didn‚Äôt know but I had never met a trans person. It‚Äôs probably a good thing I didn‚Äôt know at first because I would had some false and harsh preconceived notions about her. Ultimately we became even closer friends, she became a lawyer that represents lgbtq+ people almost exclusively. I admire her so much. 

Being a straight white man I‚Äôll never understand the lifestyle or challenges associated with it but I will always do my best to be an ally. I think that‚Äôs the best we can do.

Well.  The Times They Are A-Changin' (paraphrased from the great poet and Nobel Laureate - and one of my favorite humans - Bob Dylan).  

Thank goodness!

The Times They Are A-Changin [here](https://youtu.be/90WD_ats6eE).

Come gather 'round people

Wherever you roam

And admit that the waters

Around you have grown

And accept it that soon

You'll be drenched to the bone

If your time to you is worth savin'

And you better start swimmin'

Or you'll sink like a stone

For the times they are a-changin'

Come writers and critics

Who prophesize with your pen

And keep your eyes wide

The chance won't come again

And don't speak too soon

For the wheel's still in spin

And there's no tellin' who

That it's namin'

For the loser now

Will be later to win

For the times they are a-changin'


Come senators, congressmen

Please heed the call

Don't stand in the doorway

Don't block up the hall

For he that gets hurt

Will be he who has stalled

The battle outside ragin'

Will soon shake your windows

And rattle your walls

For the times they are a-changin'

Come mothers and fathers

Throughout the land

And don't criticize

What you can't understand

Your sons and your daughters

Are beyond your command

Your old road is rapidly agin'

Please get out of the new one

If you can't lend your hand

For the times they are a-changin'


The line it is drawn

The curse it is cast

The slow one now

Will later be fast

As the present now

Will later be past

The order is rapidly fadin'

And the first one now

Will later be last

For the times they are a-changin'

"And after hearing all he owes after being found guilty of criminal tax fraud is $1.6 million or the equivalent of $5 to your average person, it sounds like he's winning. What a joke the legal system is in the US.",1
"It's all coming to light now.

The __demagogic temerity__ of pugnacious, narcissistic, and want-to-be fascist dictator / defeated grifter and one term former President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice)__ and the imbroglio he has foisted upon our country *knows no bounds.* Guilty __(at the very least) of extreme direlection of duty, his cognitive dissonance __moves forward unchecked.__

>*So here‚Äôs a clue as to why Donald Trump did not want anyone reading his individual tax returns. His company has just been convicted of criminal fraud for evading taxes on benefits paid to executives. The accused was Trump‚Äôs company, not Trump himself. Nor was Trump one of the executives accused of evasion. Yet the jeopardy to Trump personally is very near and very real.*

The prosecutor knew they had a good case. And pursued it.

>*New York State‚Äôs prosecutors asserted at trial that Trump had explicitly approved the evasion scheme: ‚ÄúThis is all part of the Trump executive compensation package. Free cars for you, free cars for your wife, free apartments for you, free apartments for your kids. apartments for you, free apartments for your kids. Why not pay them more? Because it would cost them double to give them raises rather than give them the cars on the down-low.‚Äù*

There is so much more on the horizon, of course. He can run, but he can't hide.

>*The jury‚Äôs verdicts cast light on a series of related questions that now loom large.*

>*Why did Trump fight all the way to the Supreme Court to conceal his individual tax returns from scrutiny?*

>*Why did Trump make such a priority of personal control of the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Justice, given his general lack of concern with the mechanics of government?*

>*Why was Trump willing to commit impeachable offenses in his effort to win the election of 2020, and then even more and worse impeachable offenses to hold on to power in 2021 after his defeat?*

The narcissistic sociopath, __unhinged insurrectionist,__ and grifter (with a pronounced case of logorrhea) known as one term twice impeached former President Trump, has a pattern of explaining, excusing, deflecting and blaming others for the circumstances he finds himself in.",1
My thoughts? I wonder if fantasizing about shooting the president to the point where they shoot at a cardboard cutout would be considered a threat to his life legally?,1
Take a picture of the bullet rides Biden cutout and send it to the Secret Service.,1
"I had to cut off all friends who are rabid Trumpers because the stress of being around them was unbearable. If they want to support (worship) him, that's fine. Unfortunately, most want to sing his praises and try to prove to you how great he is by repeating one crackpot 'fact' after another. My 3 sisters adored the Apprentice show and are all Trumpers. I told them that the moment his name is brought up in a conversation that I will leave. We rarely talk. I've made it very clear how I feel about Trump and the idiocy that was his presidency. As the Republicans get more threatening and crazy, I won't talk politics with any of them at all.",1
"I like the way you're thinking strategically. My concern is that the bad behavior has no limits. It gives permission to others to act badly and snowballs out of control. An example is Nazi Germany and now we see Russia going the same way.

If we let it go unchecked, we'll find ourselves having to defend ourselves with force. It might be better to make ourselves more attractive than encouraging them to get uglier.

But again, I like how you think!",1
Please don't insult me by praising Chump and using a likeness of President Biden. Can we agree not to discuss our opposing political views in the name of family peace? Insulting others is rude.,1
No good answers to this. Better to just stay away. Definitely don‚Äôt encourage bad behavior. Independents see it plenty anyway. Don‚Äôt poke a beast unless you want to fight.,1
"My thoughts? Yes, let them think we are upset so they continue being nasty.

Years ago before I left Twitter, there was a hashtag #OpLetThemSpeak. It was tongue-in-cheek humor about the awful thing they said. But today, a few years later, it's become apparent that the awful things they say cost Republicans elections.

In the recent midterms, Democrats decided to put money into the most extreme candidates in the Republican primaries because they felt that an extremist would be easier to beat than a moderate. Pundits at the time warned that this was a risky strategy, but it paid off handsomely. Every single extremist candidate that they backed in the primaries went on to lose in the general election.

People are turned off by hate speech, bullying, and bigotry, more importantly voters are turned off by those things. We have the opportunity to do some branding here, let's make the Republican ""brand"" a brand of extremism, hatred, bullying, and bigotry.",1
"I'm so sick of the childish, selfish and downright untenable position of these assholes.  Nothing you say can change them from acting like cult members.  Trump is losing his grip with Republicans so they'll probably jump to the more popular DeSantis side to stay on ""the winning team.""  Wait for the backpeddling to begin.",1
">Instead, I thought it would be better to express my discust at their behavior because we don't want them to moderate. 

???

I absolutely want them to moderate.",1
"Radicalize the Republicans!!! >:] And we shall be dominant, and then our liberal snowflake agenda shall in bed into the heads of America!!! >:D yesh",1
"Doubtful.
Gun ranges sold Obama targets by the gross nationally..",1
"They only told me about the cut-out as they bragged about their shooting range so I didn't see it and I imagine it would be a free speech issue.   
Per the agreement several years ago, we are not supposed to talk about politics among the family, this was their most obvious violation of that rule.   


My question was really about how whether we should encourage them to continue to be assholes, or show them the folly of their ways?",1
"As an old lady who voted GOP a few times in her long life, heard how badly Obama was talked about, detested Trump for over 6 decades, I will never vote GOP again, and I did break off any ‚Äúfriendships‚Äù I had with Trumpers. You will NOT change their mind with facts, figures or reality. It truly is a cult.",1
"Yeah, my problem is, the moderate republicans did ok in the midterm, and they are complacent when it comes to speaking out against the extreme asshole trump behavior. 

Using your nazi analogy, it was the fact that a lot of moderate parties were willing to allow the nazi's to hold/gain power (they only got 37% of the vote in 1937, so they had to form a coalition with other parties to hold power). Had the Nazis made clear they're willingness gas chamber millions of Jews, maybe a lot of the moderate parties would not have backed them. We let the trump supports show their willingness to shoot politicians they don't like, and the moderate center of America wouldn't let them have too much power",1
"My simple instinct wants them to moderate, but strategically, it would be better for the democrats in 2024 if they don't.",1
Good point. It‚Äôs not like we have a legal system that works anyway.,1
"I guess I‚Äôm the wrong person to give an answer to that if I‚Äôm honest.

I lost patience with the people like this (family and friends) awhile ago. It reached a boiling part almost exactly a year ago today and I cut off contact with them. I will say it has been a tremendous boon to my mental and emotional health.",1

Agreed!,1
"You're right. The cowardly complacent allowed the maga ugly to come to and stay in power. Thankfully, enough of the fence sitters this midterm saw the grass on that side was foul.",1
"My first concern is the health of our democracy. While I'm a lifelong liberal, I also firmly believe in the two-party system. If I had my wish, the GOP would find a new platform and begin providing constructive checks and balances again.

We don't want a unitary state and the way things are right now is dangerous. I'm happy that Democrats are regaining lost power, but I don't want absolute control. Playing games with fascists is dangerous and so I'll continue criticizing them until they start acting rational, again.",1
"Cutting people like that out of your life is self care. 

I haven‚Äôt talked to 2/3rds of my family in 10-15 years and I‚Äôm no worse off for it.",1
It‚Äôs a good start but I‚Äôm disappointed that 16 years of tax fraud only means up to $1.6m in fines. Surely they profited way more than that.,1
"It's nice to see this happened! I am crossing my fingers this will continue to expand. Get all of Trump's people, then take him out!",1
Bit by bit I hope they take his wealth and put it into more useful places. Hopefully in his lifetime,1
*Trumps hopefuly next to be found guilty and then hopefuly he will go to ADX Florence Super Max Prison in Florence Colorado.*,1
"Now‚Ä¶what are odds people read the article and see the details and not just the headline??? 

I‚Äôll sum it up, no your wish didn‚Äôt come true. A handful of top executives were found guilty and Donald was not charged with any of it. But the headline reads well‚Ä¶this is why you do t name company with your own name lol.",1
This is just the beginning,1
Finally!,1
"This is where my pessimism comes poking out. In what universe is there justice when a person will never be held to any kind of accountability for any of his long and lengthening history of likely crimes? This proves to me that no matter what they go after, they will always let him off the hook. 

What head of any organization who is convicted of *serious* tax fraud just walks away from it?  I thought ENRON set the standard to say that the C Suite cannot just say they didn't know what was going on. There is no real justice out there for people who are not rich, powerful, or both. We all suffer to scrap and scrape and are held to standards that these people are simply immune to.

I'm sure someone out there can tell me the legal reasons that he is not accountable and the myriad of excuses afforded to him and his ilk... but I just don't care to hear it. However you want to apologize for our legal system, it is simply broken.",1
Why is the fine so damn low. This just screams ‚Äúkeep doing it.‚Äù,1
"Consequences probably a fine which Trump Carrie‚Äôs in his wallet, here‚Äôs my platinum card now leave me alone.",1
Democrats have spent a fortune of tax payers‚Äô money to incriminate Trump just to land a possible maximum fine of 1.6 million. Another L as usual for the left,1
"So if you read the article. The headline is misleading. This guy Weisselberg worked for trump as a financial adviser, didn't pay personal taxes on some assets and they charged 2 of trumps organizations that the guy worked for. The only information I have is from the CNN website.",1
All of this for less than $2 million. Waste of my eyes to bother reading about this. Talk to me when our AG grows a spine,1
1.6m in fine. Lol. That's like charging a regular citizen $16 for tax fraud. That'd never happen though.,1
"Very small fines and Trump had nothing to do with it, just in name, as per the rulings.",1
"Not to mention if I committed tax fraud in a much lower scale. Not only would I be fined, but I‚Äôd go to prison. Of course here they would never even imagine sending trump to prison. Just a slap on the wrist and off you go.",1
"its not the fine that is the point, its now trump org essentially cannot work with certain big institutions due to the label of being a fraud.

The other dominoes will hurt them even more and make them regret making a stake in new york city, possibly destroying his empire",1
Gotta have wealth to distribute to do that,1
This stops loans. He can no longer launder funds through Trump org as easily now and is about to hit the harder lawsuit let alone the  other states and Federal charges. This was step one finally.,1
His ass will say he‚Äôs broke af,1
Like sending it to the Ukraine and/or funding transphobia awareness out in the Middle East,1
Just saw the finale last night üò≠,1
"I read the article.  And while Trump wasn't individually charged, he was explicitly ""in the know.""  The defense argument that Trump knew nothing was thoroughly refuted.

But you're right about one thing, though: Trump won't face any real consequences (though I'm not sure why anyone thinks that is a \*good\* thing).",1
"A lot of people already knew he wouldn't have been charged with anything and wouldn't have had to pay much if he was. It was all over the news. But it's not as if this isn't good news for multiple reasons:

1. Guilty on all counts proves a non-biased jury CAN be found.
2. This emboldens all the other district attorneys, DoJ attorneys, etc., and helps quell the ""We'll never get him, so we shouldn't even try"" Eeyore bullshit that hamstrings investigations and prosecutions. 
3. It was proven he did know, so now the IRS can come after him.
4. Banks will now be much less apt to loan him any money.
5. Other agencies involved in real estate may sanction the company. I don't know what licenses or approvals are needed to build buildings, but this and the other suits will likely make at least some of those agencies less apt to give him any benefit of any doubt. 
6. He lost. SEVENTEEN times. He hates losing. Yes, I have schadenfreude.",1
Yes!  Also sad that it‚Äôs the end of 2022 and it‚Äôs just the beginning.  Good grief!  LOL,1
Nope. Not just a fine. Banks will be less apt to loan him money now. IRS can come after him. And other attorneys and agencies going after him are emboldened now.,1
Is ‚Äúcannot work with certain big institutions‚Äù really a problem though? There will always be pro-trump companies willing to support.,1
They still haven't got passed the homophobic part yet.,1
*Its nowhere near over yet.*,1
Really emboldened the civil lawsuit.,1
Awesome. But it should not have been this close.  Republicans should learn that quality of candidates matter.  I‚Äôm assuming next time they will just run a Stapler against him. But knowing Republicans it will soon be revealed that it was Hitlers Stapler,1
"It's shameful this race was as close as it was. Walker was put forth as a Republican candidate only because he was black. But black voters are not stupid & did not fall for this embarrassing #Oki-Doke candidate who is, as #Chapelle said, ""observedly stupid""!",1
"Can the Senate rollback Rule 22 to the pre-1975 wording and kill the ""silent filibuster""?",1
Why was it this close?,1
Or... and hear me out..... America needs some drastic election reforms to correct the gerrymandering and voter suppression that the GOP engage in so that they can remain competitive.,1
It's observably and what is with those hashtags?,1
"We need a LOT of reforms, including doing away with the bloody Electoral College.

However...many of those reforms require a constitutional amendment, and there are far too many with a vested interest in the status quo.",1
And christo-fascists are lousy tippers.,1
"TL:DR, the restaurant did to the church exactly what the church wants to do to LGBT. 

Per the Church . . .  They somewhat admitted they went there to start shit with the LGBTQ friendly nature of the place. No mater what the restaurant did it was going to end badly. These a-holes literally want to be able to exclude LGBTQ+ from the public places, public spaces, and existing at all.  (It all on there hateful website)

Per the Restaurant  

‚ÄúThe reservation was for an event with supporters to inform them further about the Family Foundation [FF], Cobb said,‚Äù the Examiner also informed. ‚ÄúA total of 15-20 people, consisting of the guests and some staff members, were meant to be in attendance.‚Äù

The restaurant later explained itself. ‚ÄúWe have always refused service to anyone for making our staff uncomfortable or unsafe and this was the driving force behind our decision,‚Äù read an Instagram post from the eatery, ‚Äúa German-influenced restaurant in the Union Hill neighborhood whose kitchen is helmed by co-owner Brittanny Anderson, a veteran of TV cooking shows including ‚ÄòTop Chef‚Äô and ‚ÄòChopped,‚Äô‚Äù relates The Washington Post.

‚ÄúMany of our staff are women and/or members of the LGBTQ+ community. All of our staff are people with rights who deserve dignity and a safe work environment,‚Äù the Instagram post continued. ‚ÄúWe respect our staff‚Äôs established rights as humans and strive to create a work environment where they can do their jobs with dignity, comfort and safety.‚Äù",1

"Quote from church group:
‚ÄúEveryone should be concerned that people are being denied service based on their politics.‚Äù

Yet the group‚Äôs anti abortion and LGBTQ‚Äôs politics is driven by their religion. I wonder what the overtly religious Supreme Court would leak out on this case.",1
Give the hypocrites a taste of their own medicine.,1
Suddenly not making that wedding cake doesn't seem like such a good idea.,1
I see nothing wrong with this.,1
The right is insanely overrepresented.  It's time to show the right how it feels to be a minority in America,1
"This ain‚Äôt it. We can‚Äôt condemn one group for refusing service to some group we like, but then praise one group for refusing service to some group we hate. It should be both equal and equitable",1
"I don't think they understand the issue. Gay people were welcome to come in and buy anything off the shelf at the bakery. The web site designer was willing to make any standard web site for a gay couple. Neither were willing to use their artistic expression to contribute to a gay marriage, which they believed was sin (stupid, but then that's religion for you). The web site designer would turn away a hetero person asking for a gay marriage site for a friend.

This restaurant denied standard service to a group just because of their religious beliefs. Should the court rule in favor of the web site maker, this restaurant will not be covered by that protection should this religious group sue because they are doing two different things.",1
"Am very curious how serving a steak is compelled speech. 

Saying a group doesn‚Äôt make you feel safe is a far different argument and underscores the fact the restaurant wanted to spike the football instead of abide by principles.",1
"I would rather we not compare this to the religious freedom BS happening with cakes and websites.  They are not comparable at all.

This isn't about religious or sex or gender discrimination. This is entirely about the wellbeing of the staff and the sustainability of the business.  These people are being disinvited for being an existential threat to the people working there.",1
"To be honest, as a Christian, this is fine with me in a way

So why is it okay to refuse business to a gay couple, but not Christians?

Discrimination shouldn‚Äôt happen either way",1
Love it. üëç,1
BRAVO!,1
"While I agree in principle, the reality is that the law allows for refusal of service based on one's personal moral values. This judicial interpretation was promulgated by Christian conservatives themselves. 

Therefore I do not see any reason why other aggrieved groups reciprocate in such a manner that would result in the original legal ruling be revisited.",1
"It's more of a piece of consciousness-raising theater.  Saying, ""how would you like it if people who found *you* offensive got to refuse *you* service, O Thou Nest of Karens?"".",1
"You missed it by miles. The Supreme court is going to rule that a person sincerely held religious beliefs are ground to be a bigot and exclude them from service.  Because the Radical right, the Christians want a nation based upon of separation, they are getting it.  The clowns deserved to be kicked out.",1
"And that restaurant has the right to refuse service to a pack of bigots as much as  that bakery did against people it deemed ""sinful"".     


You can't have it both ways, pick a lane and be consistent.",1
"In the same way that making a cake is, presumably.",1
"Ok that makes more sense. I didn‚Äôt know they had passed a law that propagated the refusal of service based on someone‚Äôs identity. Hopefully now that the shoe is on the other foot, they can review the law and hopefully get rid of it.",1
Masterpiece cake case happened only because the gay couple in question intentionally sought them out knowing the cake maker‚Äôs views.,1
">And that restaurant has the right to refuse service to a pack of bigots as much as that bakery did against people it deemed ""sinful"".

That pack of bigots didn't ask for any custom creation for a bigoted event that would invoke the 1st Amendment rights of the creator of the work. They just came in to eat and were refused service. That bakery did not refuse any LGBT person who came in to buy their general baked goods, only custom creations for same-sex weddings.

It is both ways because it's two different subjects.",1

"Yeah, totally the same amount of expression between ‚Äúmedium rare‚Äù and a celebration of a historically significant recognized social-religious contract, nothing disingenuous at all about the equivalence.",1
"No laws were passed. A recent Supreme Court ruling allows private business owners to refuse service based on personal, sincerely held religious beliefs. This is the basis of all Freedom of Religion laws. In practice, it allows conservative Christians to refuse service to LGBT citizens or their kin, even in dire circumstances. 

This judicial position doesn't just cover a business as a while, but makes allowances for individual employees to refuse service even if the business allows LGBT people/women to seek a service in general. 

Conversely, this judicial position dubiously allows someone whose sincerely held beliefs include the toleration and equal treatment of all people (LGBT included) to be allowed to refuse service to those who wish to trample upon the rights and freedoms of others. 

Long story short, the chickens are coming home to roost. Christian conservatives have only themselves to blame for opening this can of worms.",1

Yeah that's irrelevant.   


If a bakery can refuse service based on their christo-fascist beliefs have deemed the person to be inherently sinful because of who they are, then a restaurant can refuse service to a pack of hateful christo-fascists.",1
So you‚Äôre saying the state should be the arbiter of which forms of expression are meaningful?,1
"It‚Äôs entirely relevant because that is what the case is about. This restaurant is refusing to provide general goods and services based on the identity of a customer at the business, but that‚Äôs not what the case before the court is.",1
"No, the 1st amendment does that and that's where Colorado got in hot water with public accommodation laws.",1
">This restaurant is refusing to provide general goods and services based on the identity of a customer at the business,

And that is not really different than a bakery refusing to provide a service for a gay couple that they offer a straight couple.   
Your position would *maybe* have ground to stand on if 

* the restaurant was like a buffet place, with food already made and waiting there for the christo-fascists to acquire, or if the restaurant was a fast food place with pre-made food under a heat-lamp, AND
* Being gay was an opinion.

  
Your position is akin to ""Well it doesn't matter if the people walking in were Nazis, the Jewish restaurant has to serve them...."" when really no, they don't.",1
"The exact same argument could apply to existing laws against racial discrimination. People explicitly argued that they should be able to discriminate against interracial couples because of their religion! 

Your religious beliefs aren't an excuse to discriminate.",1
"You're still not getting it. 

The restaurant serves dishes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Anyone can come in, sit down, and order any of those dishes. Rejecting anyone on the basis of religion or sex is illegal discrimination. The web site or bakery never did this. This restaurant did. 

>And that is not really different than a bakery refusing to provide a service for a gay couple that they offer a straight couple.

If I wanted to gift a wedding web site to a gay friend who was getting married, this company would also refuse me, a straight person. 

It is the custom, expressive nature of these specific services that makes it legally complicated, not who is requesting the service. The restaurant was just serving their standard dishes, so their case has nothing to do with the case before the court now or the cake shop. 

But if you want the Westboro Baptists to be able to force a gay-run bakery to make a custom cake for their ""God Hates Fags"" rally, then fine. That will be the result if the web site company loses because that is exactly the legal issue before the court right now.",1
Your immutable sexual orientation isn‚Äôt an excuse to compel labor or expression.,1

"Again, that same argument could be made against religion, race, sex, or any other protected class.

‚ñ† Imagine always overthrowing an election because you do not like who got elected? 

‚ñ† Imagine deciding how someone votes, when they vote, if they can vote, and whether or not their vote will even be counted? 

‚ñ† Imagine deciding that you don't like the fact that a certain district has a history of leaning towards an all Democrat vote? And you've decided that it should be all Republican? Imagine gerrymandering to restructure district lines to your liking? So that your fantasy comes true? And there is nothing that anyone can do about it.

‚ñ† Imagine deciding that if you don't like the results of an election? You can just pretend the election never occurred and keep the incumbent in office? 

‚ñ† Imagine a No Holds Barred implementation of your fantasy so that, forever more? Only candidates that you like and support are put into office? With no way to protest, complain or stop the onslaught of your puppets? 

There are things like this being supported and put into place, right now, and even worse. 

That is why this case is in front of SCOTUS today.

>*At issue is a new legal theory that could conceivably give state legislatures virtually unchecked power over federal elections and erode major principles of democracy.*

State legislators could take all the power that they wanted? And not have any oversight. Be able to do whatever they wanted.

>*The ""independent state legislature theory,"" referred to as ISL, could give state legislatures independent power to put in place all manner of election rules, without any available review by state courts. In its most extreme form, the theory could eliminate not just state judicial power over elections, but governors' vetoes, and it might even allow state legislatures to certify presidential electors who were not approved by the voters, an idea that Donald Trump sought, unsuccessfully, to put forth in 2020.*

In a nutshell?

>*The case before the court is a perhaps more modest exercise of the conservative ISL theory. The North Carolina state legislature, dominated by Republicans, is seeking to overturn a decision by the state Supreme Court. That court ruled that the Republican legislature, in drawing new congressional district lines after the 2020 Census, had violated the state constitution with an extreme partisan gerrymander. The court twice ordered the legislature to redraw the map, and when those efforts came up short, the state court, with the aid of court-appointed election experts, redrew new lines itself.*

It's scary to think what the Republicans are trying to do. 

It seems like it is their intention to win at all costs. 

Even if they do something illegal. 

Even if they do something immoral come. 

As long as they win? They don't seem to care.

>*We know that at the end of the day, if this court rules in favor of the Republicans, that state legislatures across the country will have exclusive control over running federal elections in their states, which stands our system of checks and balances on its head,"" he said.*

"I honestly don‚Äôt know how an actual judge could rule against this. It‚Äôs pretty explicitly stated in the heroes act that the president has been granted this power by congress.

>‚ÄúNotwithstanding any other provision of law, unless enacted with specific reference to this section, the Secretary of Education may waive or modify any statutory or regulatory provision applicable to the student financial assistance programs . . . as the Secretary deems necessary in connection with a war or other military operation or national emergency.‚Äù

> Section 1098bb(a)(2) further provides that any waiver or modification must not act to worsen a student‚Äôs financial position under the loan. Thus, during the period of suspension, no interest will accrue on outstanding loans so that borrowers are in the same position as they were before the suspension period began.

>Section 1098bb(b)(3) provides for blanket waivers or modifications to the statute or regulations ‚Äî that is, such waivers or modifications do not need to be reviewed and granted case by case.

The suspension of payments we are currently enjoying is based on this law as well.",1
This is a presidential powers question. It needs to come from Congress (‚Äúpower of the purse‚Äù) not the president (no purse power ranger).,1

I do think student loan forgiveness will survive the Supreme Court though. 7-2 is my best guess with Kavanugh, Gorush and Roberts voting with the 4 left justices. I would also not be surprised if ACB joins and makes it 8-1.",1

It's like the red flag laws. Lots of Democrats support it but try to couch it in nice-sounding terms, like there's nothing wrong with them.

Treason by Trump - Again!!!!!!!!,1
"The __demagogic temerity__ of pugnacious, narcissistic, and want-to-be fascist dictator / defeated grifter and one term former President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice)__ and the imbroglio he has foisted upon our country *knows no bounds.* Guilty __(at the very least) of extreme direlection of duty, his cognitive dissonance __moves forward unchecked.__

The White House and Democrats have come forward, condemning one term former President Trump's (the only president to be impeached twice) disgusting statements.

>*""White House spokesman Andrew Bates said Mr Trump's comments were ""anathema to the soul of our nation"". ""You cannot only love America when you win,"" Mr Bates said in a statement.* 

Saying that our US Constitution should be destroyed is like saying you hate the USA and you are an insurrectionist. And clearly?  President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice)__ truly supports his own narrative that he has been promoting for years.

>*The White House has condemned former President Donald Trump after he called for the ""termination"" of the US constitution.*

Where are the droves of Republicans coming out of the shadows to condemn one term former President Trump's (the only president to be impeached twice) words? Can you imagine if a Democratic candidate for US president spewed forth with this grotesque ideology?

>*In the post, Mr Trump referred to vague allegations of ""massive & widespread fraud and deception"" and asked whether he should be immediately returned to power. ""A Massive Fraud of this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution. Our great 'Founders' did not want, and would not condone, False & Fraudulent Elections!"" he said.*

IMO?

Former President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice)__ is actually laying the groundwork for another insurrection. He is quite succint and has left no doubt in regards to what his intentions are.

Maybe the fawning sychophants of the radical Trumpanzee Republicon right could conjure up a way to debase themselves some more?

And if that's not bad enough? Former President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice)__ claims he had no knowledge of certain people who dined with him. Anyone who knows anything about the Secret Service and the president would know that no one comes near former President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice)__ unless they are veted. For instance? You or I could not just walk up to Mar-a-Lago or anywhere else. and sit down at the same table for a meal. Ye is known for his radical beliefs and hate filled rhetoric and ideology. And he also invited a well know denier.

It's no coincidence that he sat down for a meal with these people right after announcing his intent to enter the election for the office of the US presidency.

>*But he has come under fire this week after dining with a known white nationalist and Holocaust denier at his Florida home. Mr Trump said he was not aware that the man would be present and said he had accompanied the rapper Kanye West - who earlier this week expressed admiration for Adolf Hitler and has been accused of a host of antisemitic comments.*

The Republican Party *currently supports* autocracy, bribes, bullying, cheating, control of a woman's body, dismantling the US Constitution, fascism, fear, fraud, hatred, insurrectionists, racism, stealing top secret government documents, white supremacy, __pursuit of alternative facts (lies)__ and grifting.

When someone tells you who they are the first time? You need to believe them. And that's what America needs to do if they plan on ridding our political offices of these types of influences.

Edit - Added last paragraph.",1
*Donald J Trump is trying to destroy American democracy and he must not win the next election because if he does he will not make America great again and it would be a permanent end to American democracy and the damage will be done and it wont be able to be repaired and there will be no turning back. Watch out and very scary.*,1
Obviously not condemned by republicans‚Ä¶ how on brand of them,1
"u/apefist

You mentioned:

>>*Right but they can flip in an instant. It makes me nervous*

__Everyone is nervous__ about SCOTUS.

President Biden signed a bill in May 2022 to ensure Americans can check the financial disclosures of Federal judges and Supreme Court justices. 

Judges have been remiss in filing their financial disclosures. Now? The financial disclosures will be in an online format so that everyone will be able to check. It would be good to know if a judge was hearing a case that involved a company that he or his family members owned stock. I think that's a very significant change for American jurisprudence.

>*The new law, the Courthouse Ethics and Transparency Act, mandates the creation of an online database where the public can search federal judges‚Äô and Supreme Court justices‚Äô financial disclosures. It also mandates that judges and justices follow the same financial disclosure rules as Congress, which require that transaction reports are filed for any securities trades worth more than $1,000 within 45 days of the deal. The law says the database must be online within 180 days of enactment and that all future disclosures must be uploaded within 90 days of the May 15 filing deadline.*

I hope Congress is able to force Code of Ethics / Standards on SCOTUS.

>*Supreme Court justices are the only judicial officers in the country not governed by an ethics code, and Democrats have introduced bills in both the House and the Senate that would not only impose a formal code of conduct, but also raise standards for when judges and justices must recuse themselves because of a perceived conflict of interest.*

For the first time in years? Ethics standards could be implemented. SCOTUS might have to recuse themselves if there is a conflict of interest. 

I so hope that this is something that will be taken seriously and implemented as soon as possible.

>*After calls for broader reforms of the Supreme Court dominated the Democratic presidential primary, President Joe Biden issued an executive order in April 2021 establishing a commission of legal experts to provide analysis of the ‚Äúprincipal arguments‚Äù for and against -‚Äúincluding an appraisal of the merits and legality‚Äù - of various proposed reforms, such as changing the size and composition of the court or imposing term limits on justices. Some progressive advocates felt the reform commission would give an opinion on such proposals. But in the end, the commissioners did not take a position on either controversial issue. Democrats have introduced bills in the House and the Senate that would impose term limits on justices, but they have not advanced.*

Let's encourage our legislatures to push this initiative forward. Write them and let them know you're interested in a code of ethics for SCOTUS.

Remember? You can write the White House / President Biden. Notify your state's Governor and Congress (which consists of the House of Representatives and the Senate) that you ___ARE___ watching them and paying attention to what they are doing and saying.

So you have to take ownership over it yourself. You have to understand that you cannot control other people's actions and beliefs, and you have to take from it what you like and enjoy and leave the rest to others.

In the western world, we have to delude ourselves to sleep at night. Just purchasing standard household items can support child labor. Or sweatshops. We can try to only purchase from places we are assured are clean of exploitation, but if you own a cell phone...

The point to the defund police movement was to reduce bad  police officers, invest in good ones via salary increases, and dispatch non-police socal workers to domestic disturbances.     The right turned in into a doom spiral of 'liberals want to get rid of all police'

So no, liberals don't hate police, liberals hate how many bad police are in the system.  It was bad branding, abused by the right.

Clearly, enough Georgians have supported him for him to get this far.",1
Sounds more like he's willfully committing fraud to me. One of the qualifications for state senator is living in the state for 9 years,1
Lol,1
Finally. Someone that wasn‚Äôt a child when chocolate chip cookies were invented.,1
My inner grammarian has questions,1
Is 52 too old too?  Is the left-wingers out there gonna gripe that the Dems didn't pick someone in their 30s?,1
Is this supposed to be a jab at something? Is pointing out the huge age disparity between politicians and the people they represent bothering you?,1
"The average House member age for this Congress was 58 and some change. Choosing a 52 year old for a high profile leadership position seems about right. 

You seem more committing to being anti ‚Äúleft-winger‚Äù than entertaining the idea that they might have any good ideas.",1
"I'm 54 and the people who have represented me get closer to my age every year. 

Seriously, ageism was even more popular when Boomers were children. E.g. ""Don't trust anyone over 30"".",1
">I'm 54 and the people who have represented me get closer to my age every year.

First of all, that's half my point. You shouldn't wait until you've retired to be the same age as the average congress member to be represented.

My second point is that congress is actively getting older.",1
"Age is just a number. 30 years from now, when young people today are my age, they'll have realized that all their peers didn't share the same views, after all. The Gen Z white supremacists who are stirring up shit today, will still be stirring up shit and Gen WhoseNext will be blaming Gen Z for all of the world's problems.

Besides, I expect older adults to be more wise and experienced, as my Native American ancestry always has.",1
It doesn‚Äôt do everything that it should but it‚Äôs still a solid win and I‚Äôll take it.,1
"*EXTRA, EXTRA! READ ALL ABOUT IT!*

""Federal government can't make you be a good human, but can at least make you recognize when someone else is. ""

My favorite part is making sure that no non-tax-paying preacher will ever be forced to preform a same-sex ceremony. We'll turn the other way when they unlawfully become political motivators, spew actual open hatred for other law-abiding citizens, and pretend to hold moral authority to tell any of us what to do... but no, don't worry; You won't ever have to acknowledge the basic human rights and dignity of your fellow humans. Not on our watch.",1
Bills need bipartisan support. You‚Äôre not going to get a bill granting federal same sex marriages right now.,1
Another ‚Äústates rights‚Äù bill that will do no thing to keep marriage legal in the crappy south if Obergfell is repealed. You will have to leave your state to get married if it is.,1
What else should it do?,1
"Make it legal federally. This doesn‚Äôt force states to perform same sex marriages, it only forces them to recognize same sex marriages from other states. That‚Äôs my understanding anyway.",1
Yup . So still some room to advance it but for now it‚Äôs pretty good bill,1
"This is ridiculous, it‚Äôs not real. Delete this before someone on Twitter makes it go viral and it becomes real.",1
"Master bedroom wasnt even a thing when ""masters"" existed. It's a 20th century term for the bedroom which is largest for the master(s) of a household 

You could make the argument that it's sexist, but that would be only marginally less stupid. 

They're going to perpetuate it anyways, because stupid spreads like the plague",1
I‚Äôm a home inspector and in my reporting I use the term en suite. I‚Äôm not the knee jerk type and am not offended by terminology but it‚Äôs best to use proper terminology to avoid potential conflict.,1
"It‚Äôs part of the smoke screen of anti political correctness thrown up by conservatives. How they complain the left stifles their rights to express their racism and misogyny. 

Straw man.",1
It‚Äôs not a thing. That‚Äôs just what it‚Äôs called.,1
Only if your house also has a slave bedroom.,1
"It‚Äôs not necessarily racist but it is not the preferred terminology anymore due to the negative connotations. It‚Äôs not woke or ‚Äúeverything is racist‚Äù, it‚Äôs just changing times and lots of people can‚Äôt handle it.",1
Ffs people stop being offended by stupid shit and focus on the real issues,1
Main bedroom=master bedroom,1
It‚Äôs just old language and this post can fuck off.,1
"The Special Master in the MAGA Lardo case was dismissed 'cause it sounded racist?

Republicans think it's cute to mock liberals. We will continue to have head masters, harbor masters, master keys and even masters and slaves in control networks and mechanisms. Also, master bedrooms and masters degrees in colleges.",1
No.,1
"I thought it was fake as well, they were talking about that it‚Äôs been known for over a year. I just searched it & found multiple articles supporting that it shouldn‚Äôt be said & that the correct political term should be ‚Äúprimary bedroom‚Äù New York Times/ cnn/ cbs & other sources also said this even Dating back to 2020",1
"Oh good grief, the left has adopted racism to counter opposition to what was once sound policy criticism. Well duh soon every comment becomes racial. I am an old conservative oblivious to race. Go figure.",1
I‚Äôm going to say that this is false. When we were house hunting two years ago we noticed there were no longer master bedrooms in any of the floor plans when they were put in the online listing. We obviously grew up calling it this and asked our realtor about it and they said they‚Äôve started moving away from calling it that because it can be seen as offensive. We live in a very liberal state (MA) so I suspect there is some truth that some liberals consider it to be racist.,1
For the kinky‚Ä¶.,1
"Conversely, a slave bedroom while all the other bedrooms are regular is ok also.",1
Also I‚Äôm confused by your stance on this post,1
‚Ä¶..ur so negative for what?,1
No... It's definitely something I've heard.,1
The point sailed right over your head. Your credentials as an old conservative are secure.,1
"Looking for something to be mad about. There are enough legit things to be upset about. I‚Äôm pretty liberal, but I just can‚Äôt be bothered by this.",1
I never said I was bothered by it and just because you aren‚Äôt either doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt a thing. It‚Äôs one thing to say it doesn‚Äôt exist and another to say you aren‚Äôt bothered by it.,1
"I get it. I‚Äôm sure someone has convinced themselves it‚Äôs something to be upset about, I just think it‚Äôs dumb.",1
"its fedexed from labs in china to remailers.  why bother setting up some janky lab, when you can just have professional chemists make it, and your only worry is losing some amount of inventory to interdiction.

Oh, and if you ever get an offer of an easy work from home job that just needs you to receive packages at your house and re-ship them?  its drugs and stuff bought with stolen credit cards, don't do it.",1
"95ish% of smuggled drugs come through Ports of Entry, 
not carried by immigrants..",1
china...,1
Take my upvotes great comment on the truth of the matter.,1
